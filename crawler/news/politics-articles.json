[{"article": "Attorney General Dominic Grieve is to discuss failed sexual assault and rape cases brought against high profile figures with the director of public prosecutions (DPP) Alison Saunders. It follows criticism of prosecutors after actors Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell were cleared by juries. Some Conservative MPs have also questioned the decision to charge Ribble Valley MP Nigel Evans. Mr Evans was acquitted - but the DPP  has defended the decision to prosecute. The former Conservative deputy speaker of the House of Commons, was acquitted of nine sex abuse charges, including rape, at Preston Crown Court on Thursday. The attorney general's office stressed Mr Grieve and the (DPP) hold meetings roughly every fortnight, and typically discuss major cases after the verdicts. A spokesman for the attorney general's office said: \"The running of individual cases is a matter for the independent CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and the DPP.  \"However, as part of his role superintending the CPS, and as would be normal in high-profile cases such as these, the attorney general will discuss these cases with the DPP at their next regular meeting.\" They are expected to meet after Easter. BBC  political correspondent Ross Hawkins said long standing protocol meant the attorney general did not talk to the DPP about cases once charges involving politicians have been brought until their conclusion. Mr Roache was cleared of rape and indecent assault in February and Mr Le Vell was acquitted of a number of child sex abuse charges in September last year. Prof Liz Kelly, director of the child and woman abuse studies unit in London,   she feared the debate around Mr Evans's trial was sending an \"extremely negative message to survivors of sexual violence\". \"At this time of ongoing high-profile trials, political interference undermining work to improve prosecutions of sexual offences should desist,\" she said. Critics of the CPS, including some Tory MPs, have said it must avoid bringing together a series of weak cases in an attempt to form a strong one. Ms Saunders defended the decision to take the case against Nigel Evans to court. She said the CPS was not on a mission to pursue famous people, but prosecuted every case in the same way. She said she would look at the case to see if lessons could be learned - as was normal with all acquittals - but she rejected any widespread change to CPS procedures in such cases. \"I think we made the right decision in taking it before the court,\" Ms Saunders said. \"We looked at all the evidence and decided there was a realistic prospect of conviction. And what we have to remember is that juries apply a very different, much higher test which is, are they satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt?\" She insisted the CPS would continue to take difficult cases to court provided they satisfied its test.

Not all Tories are convinced about the new code, as Vicky Young reports The Conservative Party has issued a voluntary code of conduct to all its MPs telling them not to \"bully, abuse or harass\" their employees.  Staff were entitled to \"work in an environment free from unwelcome behaviour and inappropriate language\", the document says. The move comes amid concerns over the working culture in Westminster.  Commons Speaker John Bercow has plans to launch a hotline for staff with concerns about bulling.  And an investigation by Channel 4 News, broadcast on Thursday,   in a survey of parliamentary workers. The programme said it had interviewed 70 people from \"all political parties and sexual orientations\", and found that incidents of sexual harassment and abuse of power in Parliament were commonplace. Young men were more likely to be sexually harassed than women, it concluded.  A Conservative spokesman explained: \"The code of conduct acts as a basic statement of what should be best practice in the workplace for Conservative members and their staff.\"  People are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect as they carry out their work\u201d \"It is based upon a three-stage process of mediation, grievance hearing and appeal.  \"The process conforms to relevant employment law, ACAS guidance and HR best practice and is added as a schedule to the contract of employment.\" .

But it is nonetheless in the process of establishing \"an independent complaints process which will apply to every member of the Parliamentary Labour Party\", a spokesperson added.  \"These changes will make sure there is a clear, independent process for people who work for MPs to make a complaint about serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour.  \"These proposals have been drafted in conjunction with lawyers, HR professionals and trade unions who represent the staff of many MPs and peers.\" Commons speaker John Bercow is planning to launch a confidential hotline for MPs or staff who feel they have been the victim of bullying or harassment. In a statement, Mr Bercow said bullying and harassment in the workplace was \"completely unacceptable\" and that he would now look into whether procedures in Parliament were in need of reform. \"People are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect as they carry out their work,\" he said. \"The experience of working in Parliament for an MP should be positive and fulfilling. Time and again, people have told me how fortunate they feel to work here. \"That said, having learned for the first time this afternoon of these allegations, I will consider if there are lessons for the House of Commons to learn or procedures to be reformed. \"MPs are self-employed and employ their staff directly. The House, therefore, is limited in its ability to intervene in cases in which allegations of bullying or harassment by MPs of their staff are concerned. These cases are clearly a matter for the political parties.\" Emma Grossmith, senior solicitor at legal firm Just Employment Law, said that some MPs were likely to be \"first-time employers\", who \"may not always have been as robust in their employment practices as they ought\".

Mr Osborne said critics of the government's economic plan have been proved \"comprehensively wrong\". His speech comes a year after the International Monetary Fund said Mr Osborne's austerity policies were \"playing with fire\". Labour said Mr Osborne was \"out of touch\" with the millions of people in the UK facing a cost-of-living crisis. Speaking while in the US capital for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, the chancellor said that cutting deficits and controlling spending had \"laid the foundations for sustainable growth\". Mr Osborne admitted \"many risks remain\" but said there was cause for \"cautious optimism\". \"It's only by continuing to work through our long-term economic plan that we can deliver more economic security and a brighter future for all,\" he said. His visit comes after the latest IMF forecasts predicted the UK would be the fastest-growing major economy this year. Mr Osborne used his keynote speech to reject the arguments of the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who warned last year that the UK's austerity policies were strangling growth. And the chancellor also dismissed suggestions that the West is locked in a cycle of economic stagnation, declaring: \"Our nations' best days lie ahead.\" He said that the strengthening economy in Britain is underpinned by well-capitalised banks and a \"credible\" fiscal policy. \"Our economy has grown faster than any other in the G7 over the last year and is now forecast by the IMF to do the same in 2014,\" Mr Osborne said in his address to the American Enterprise Institute think tank. \"This is despite warnings from some that our determined pursuit of our economic plan made that impossible. \"All of this demonstrates that fiscal consolidation and economic recovery go together, and undermines the pessimistic prognosis that only further fiscal stimulus can drive sustainable growth.  \"Indeed, that is precisely the wrong prescription for our economies. \"Instead of more debt or more government spending, we need to get our public finances in order, make structural reforms and compete in the world again.\" But Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The last thing millions of people facing a cost-of-living crisis want to hear is an out-of-touch chancellor trying to tell them everything is going well. \"In 2010 George Osborne promised sustained rises in living standards, a secured rather than choked-off recovery and the books balanced by 2015. On every single pledge he has badly failed.\" Mr Leslie said Labour's plans would \"boost living standards for all\" and \"secure a strong and balanced recovery\".

Harriet Harman said the problem was also caused by \"the hours, and people being away from home\". A voluntary code of conduct has been issued to Conservative MPs telling them not to \"bully, abuse or harass\" staff. Conservative Douglas Carswell said a power to recall MPs would raise standards at Westminster. Ms Harman said Labour was reviewing its codes of conduct. A Channel 4 News investigation this week reported that a third of the young men and women working in Parliament said they had suffered sexual harassment.  It said young men were more likely to be sexually harassed than women, with 40% of the men interviewed saying they had received unwanted sexual advances. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today, Ms Harman said: \"When it comes to sexual harassment we certainly have been looking again at our codes of conduct which we've had for some time in the party, which sets out specifically what behaviour is not acceptable for an employer towards their employee in terms of sexual harassment and what the procedures are to deal with it. She added: \"I think the truth is that an awareness of how a male hierarchy can deal with often young women in a junior position is not a unique problem for Westminster. \"I think there's been a greater understanding that there needs to be better treatment of people at work.\" Ms Harman said: \"Certainly when I first arrived if you had very, very long hours, people working beyond 10pm.  \"If you have people away from home and you have a male hierarchy, that is a recipe for a culture in which sexual harassment can prevail. \"And therefore you have to have very strong procedures and send down the message that this is not acceptable, that you should be encouraged to complain and your complaint will be dealt with.\" Maria Miller MP resigned as culture secretary this week after a row over her expenses. Ms Harman called for the MPs' allowances system to be reformed again.

He said: \"Of course, if you have 650 bosses in effect, you are going to get some who aren't very good at managing people. \"Of course we need to raise standards, but I slightly wince when I hear this term 'professionalise'. \"I think it's the professionalisation of politics that's got us into this sorry state, where a lot of voters don't have confidence and trust in their elected representatives. \"The way to raise standards is to make MPs properly, outwardly accountable to the voter,\" he added. \"I think what we need ultimately is a right for voters to intervene and to sack MPs; that means a right of recall. \"Until we get that, no amount of tinkering, no amount of quango changing in Westminster, is going to restore confidence and trust.\" He said: \"If one in five voters signs a petition demanding a recall ballot there should be a recall election. \"I think we should trust the people, just as we trust juries in a court, to determine guilt.\" ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27000537", "title": ["Harriet Harman says male hierarchy at Parliament part of 'recipe for harassment'"]},
{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. First Minister Alex Salmond describes the No campaign as \"laughable\" Scotland's first minister has branded the campaign for the Union \"the most miserable, negative, depressing and thoroughly boring\" in modern times. Alex Salmond told the SNP conference Better Together was out of touch with reality, while momentum was building towards a \"Yes\" for independence. He also used his speech to reach out to women voters, announcing an increase in female representation in his cabinet. But the Better Together campaign said Mr Salmond was not giving the answers. Mr Salmond's speech came ahead of the 18 September independence referendum. The ballot will see voters asked the Yes/No question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" So, a direct pitch to the female vote - he promoted two more women to his Cabinet, he announced that future Scottish Cabinets would be at least 40% female, and he emphasised the Scottish government offer to enhance childcare post independence\u201d Polls currently indicate support for the Union, but the Scottish government says momentum is moving towards its position. Mr Salmond's speech came after recent remarks by former Nato secretary general and Scottish Labour MP Lord George Robertson, who said Scottish independence would be \"cataclysmic\" for the West in an era of international turmoil. The SNP leader said: \"The more the people of Scotland hear the case for 'No', the more likely they are to vote 'Yes'. \"And no wonder - they are the most miserable, negative, depressing and thoroughly boring campaign in modern political history. \"They are already out of touch with the people and now, I fear, they're losing touch with reality.\" In contrast, Mr Salmond said, the \"Yes\" campaign was \"positive, uplifting and hopeful\", adding: \"That is the basis on which we shall win this referendum and shall win our independence.\" The Scottish government argues Scotland is the 14th richest country among the world's most developed nations, and with independence, would be able to take control of its own resources. Under independence, the SNP government has pledged a massive expansion in childcare, which it says would help women back to work and boost the economy. Mr Salmond also said the SNP, under independence, would want companies to aspire to see their boards made up of at least 40% women. The first minister announced junior ministers Shona Robison, who oversees equality and Angela Constance, who has the youth employment brief, would be made full Scottish cabinet members. He added: \"Subject to parliamentary approval, with these two outstanding ministers in the Scottish cabinet, we practice what we preach. \"The cabinet is our board as a country, and women will make up 40% of the members of the Scottish cabinet.\" Looking ahead to 18 September, Mr Salmond said the referendum was not about the SNP, him or the wider \"Yes\" campaign. He told the packed conference hall: \"It's about putting Scotland's future in Scotland's hands.\" \"A 'Yes' vote in September is not a vote for an SNP government in 2016.  Voters in Scotland will go to the polls to vote on their country's future.  They will be asked the yes/no question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\"  The vote takes place on Thursday, 18 September, 2014. \"It's a vote for a government in Scotland that the people of Scotland choose, pursuing policies the people of Scotland support. \"It is a vote for a government in control of tax, the economy, social security, employment, immigration oil and gas revenues, European policy and a range of other areas currently under Westminster control.\" The first minister went on: \"That may be the SNP. It may be Labour. It may be a coalition.\" In an attack on the Conservatives, he added: \"I tell you what it won't be - it won't be a government led by a party with just a single member of parliament in Scotland. \"A government dismantling our welfare state. Determined to privatise public services.\" Mr Salmond went on: \"In an independent Scotland, we can give this guarantee: the era of unelected Tory governments handing out punishment to the poor and the disabled will be gone and gone for good.\" In the event of a 'Yes' vote, the first minister told the conference, talks with Westminster on the transition to independence would begin before the end of September. The \"team Scotland\" negotiating group would include non-SNP members and expertise from across the political spectrum, from both inside and outside Scotland. However, Better Together's campaign director, Blair McDougall, said of Mr Salmond's attack: \"There's something deeply ironic about someone being quite so negative in complaining about negativity, but I can't think of anything more negative than risking people's pensions, people's jobs, people's mortgages, which is exactly what Alex Salmond has done today.   \"He's still giving us no answers to the really big questions that people need answers to before they go to vote in September.\" ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26997887", "title": ["SNP conference: Salmond attacks 'negative and depressing' No campaign"]},

George Osborne: \"If you are hiding your money offshore, we are coming to get you\" People who hide their money overseas to avoid paying tax face bigger fines and could be jailed more easily under government plans to fight tax evasion. To prosecute at present, tax officials must prove a person holding income offshore has intended to evade tax. But under a new criminal standard officials would only have to show money was taxable and undeclared. Chancellor George Osborne said the changes would mean there was \"no safe haven\" for those evading tax. But Labour said the government was \"failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion\". A consultation will be held to let the public have their say on the plans.  In recent months, the UK has joined other G20 countries in focusing on moves to share information about tax evasion. Now, Mr Osborne says the government will consult on a new criminal standard, harsher fines and increased jail sentences.   At present, offshore tax evaders can be fined twice the amount they owe, and can face criminal prosecution and a possible prison sentence. The government will look at options to increase these penalties, as well as the possibility of financial rewards for whistleblowers who \"help uncover\" untaxed offshore assets. Mr Osborne, who is in Washington DC for the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, said: \"A very important part of our economic plan is that everyone makes a fair contribution.  \"We've already done a lot to crack down on those who don't pay their taxes, now we're introducing a new criminal offence for people who hide their money offshore. \"And the message is very simple - if you're hiding your money offshore, we are coming to get you and the criminal law is going to come and find you.\"  Media requires JavaScript to play.

At a time when families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and the deficit is still high, this simply isn't good enough\u201d \"That certainly has been the objective that they've followed up to now, with their various... so-called amnesties,\" he said. \"And I think that they are thinking that they may get a greater number of people coming forward if the threat of criminal prosecution is there.\" Mr McCann added: \"The over-arching difficulty that the Revenue have got is that for about 100 years in this country, we've operated a sort of prodigal son policy. \"So if someone who has got hidden assets decides to come clean and march into the local tax office, put their hands up and confess all, then the public policy put forward by the government in this country was not to prosecute them. \"And that policy is still in place.\" Mr Osborne predicted a tax deal struck between the British and Swiss governments in 2011 would recover about \u00a33bn in previously unpaid taxes in 2013.

He criticised Welsh Labour on education and the NHS, saying patients were waiting too long for heart scans.  He said Welsh Labour was guilty of \"appalling, inexcusable complacency\". \"One in seven people in Wales is on an NHS waiting list,\" he said. \"A cancer drugs fund is in England - but not here.

He also talked about education, saying it was a \"competitive world, it's not softer subjects and 'experimental' teaching these children need\". \"It's proper spelling in English, basic arithmetic in maths, the best of our history, proper respected exams,\" he said. \"It's not more of this failed, left-wing, ideological clap-trap we need... it's more rigour, more standards, more choice, more hope.\" Mr Cameron said his party was ambitious for Wales and insisted the Conservatives' long-term economic plan was working.  He said Wales was now the \"UK capital for jobs growth\". He also said the Conservatives had agreed to the largest investment in Welsh railways since the Victorian era, including electrifying the mainlines to Cardiff and Swansea. During his speech Mr Cameron said he believed in devolving income tax. He has already offered such powers subject to a referendum.  He told delegates he would like to see the Welsh government being more responsible for raising the money it spent.  Earlier, UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt launched his strongest attack on the NHS in Wales claiming it is \"sleepwalking to a Mid Staffs tragedy\". Mr Hunt criticised Wales' record on waiting times and ambulance targets. He admitted things can go wrong. \"In a system as big and complex as the NHS things do go wrong,\" he told the conference. \"But if you ignore the evidence when individual problems pile up, if you stick your head in the sand and pretend all will be fine... well, that's exactly what happened at Mid Staffs under the last Labour government in England. \"And that is what the Labour government in Cardiff is risking right now in Wales. \"They are sleepwalking into a Welsh Mid Staffs tragedy and unless we shout loud enough - alongside brave campaigners like Ann Clwyd, Gareth Williams and others who tragically lost loved ones in Welsh hospitals - these appalling lapses in care will repeat themselves time after time.\" It is not the first time Mr Hunt has criticised the NHS in Wales. In February, he claimed patients were suffering because Labour Welsh ministers were not investigating high death rates in hospitals. Mr Hunt called it a \"tragedy\" that the Welsh NHS was not adopting reforms introduced in England since the Stafford Hospital scandal. Since he made the statement a new version of Welsh hospital death rates has been published, which takes into account differences between Wales and England.

It comes as Downing Street released Mr Cameron's Easter  In it, he says: \"Easter is not just a time for Christians across our country to reflect, but a time for our whole country to reflect on what Christianity brings to Britain.\" He speaks of the \"countless acts of kindness\" carried out every day across the UK by \"those who believe in and follow Christ\". \"The heart of Christianity is to 'love thy neighbour' and millions do really live that out,\" he added, praising Alpha courses run in prisons and the \"spirit\" shown by those who had helped rescue residents during the winter storms across southern England. There is something about political leaders and their aides being asked about their Christianity that leads to memorable soundbites. Or perhaps it is because it is a topic they often avoid and so any reference to it is remembered. Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell was once reported to have batted away a question to the then PM about his faith by saying: \"We don't do God.\" And David Cameron, when he was leader of the opposition, borrowed a Boris Johnson analogy to compare his belief to the signal of a London radio station in the Chilterns. In other words, a bit patchy. Intriguingly, that signal seems rather clearer now.  Three times this week the prime minister has talked with conviction about his faith and what he believes Christianity brings to the UK. It's a message from an instinctively \"county Tory\", a Conservative from a rural background, that will appeal to the party heartlands; where some feel bruised by what they see as liberal, metropolitan concerns such as gay marriage.

Mr Cameron held a reception for Christian leaders in Downing Street on Wednesday, following a day dominated by the resignation of Culture Secretary Maria Miller after a row over her expenses. \"The Bible tells us to bear one another's burdens. After the day I've had I'm definitely looking for volunteers,\" he told the gathering. According to  the prime minister made no reference to gay marriage, a policy overseen by Mrs Miller but which threatened to damage his government's relationship with the Church of England, in his comments. Instead, he thanked churches for the work they did with the poor and urged them to speak up for Christians suffering persecution around the world. He said his \"moments of greatest peace\" occurred every other Thursday morning, when he attended Eucharist at St Mary Abbots, the west London church linked to the school his children attend. \"I find a little bit of peace and hopefully a bit of guidance,\" he added. Mr Cameron is said to have referred to Jesus Christ as \"our saviour\" during the talk. In an interview with BBC Norfolk on Thursday, Mr Cameron said he and his children mulled over \"what Easter is all about\" as they ate breakfast that morning. \"I was very impressed with their knowledge about Good Friday and Easter Sunday,\" he said. \"We had a bit of a conversation about that, (that) it wasn't about chocolate eggs. \"That was one of the themes at breakfast in the Cameron household.\" In 2009, Mr Cameron told BBC One's Songs of Praise: \"I believe in God and I'm a Christian and I worship - not as regularly as I should - but I go to church. \"Do I drop to my knees and ask for guidance whenever an issue comes up? No, I don't. But it's part of who I am.\" British politicians have traditionally shied away from talking about their own religious beliefs in public, an attitude summed up by Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who in 2003 was reported to have said: \"We don't do God.\" Mr Blair was received into the Roman Catholic faith after leaving office and set up a Faith Foundation to promote better understanding between religious groups around the world.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said it was important not to ''shy away'' from difficult cases The director of public prosecutions has said the Crown Prosecution Service was right to take the Nigel Evans sex abuse case to court. Alison Saunders said the CPS was not \"on a mission\" to pursue famous people and insisted it would not \"shy away\" from difficult cases. Former Commons deputy speaker Mr Evans was cleared of nine sex abuse charges. Calls have since been made for a review of some judicial processes, with claims his case should not have gone to court. Former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald warned that prosecutors needed to \"keep a cool head\" in investigations of historical abuse cases.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Without commenting directly on Mr Evans's case, he told the Times that prosecutors should avoid \"going on a mission\" and losing perspective. But Ms Saunders rejected suggestions the CPS was \"star-struck\". She told the BBC: \"We apply the same test no matter who the offender or the victim is, and it's very important that we do that.\" She said she would look at the Evans case to see if lessons could be learned - as was normal with all acquittals - but she rejected any widespread change to CPS procedures in such cases. \"I think we made the right decision in taking it before the court,\" Ms Saunders said. \"We looked at all the evidence and decided there was a realistic prospect of conviction. And what we have to remember is that juries apply a very different, much higher test which is, are they satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt?\" She insisted the CPS would continue to take difficult cases to court provided they satisfied its test. The head of the CPS in north west England, where Mr Evans serves as MP for Ribble Valley, backed Ms Saunders' remarks. Nazir Afzal told BBC North West Tonight: \"We don't care who the complainant is, we don't care who's being complained against, we look at the evidence.  \"The evidence is what drives us... and we allow ultimately only those cases where there's a realistic prospect [of a conviction] to go to court.\" Their comments followed Lord Macdonald's warning. He said prosecutors should not only bring \"sure-fire winners\" to court - that \"challenging\" cases needed to be prosecuted too. \"What the CPS needs to avoid, however, is going on a mission and losing perspective,\" he said. \"This particularly applies to historical cases which have garnered a lot of publicity. You have to keep a cool head.\" Lord Macdonald also   the CPS had to be \"very careful to avoid a situation where they regard a series of weak cases as amounting to a strong case\". The CPS has maintained it was right that all the evidence in the case of Mr Evans was put before a jury, but added that it respected the court's decision to clear him of all the charges. But some MPs have criticised the CPS and police after Mr Evans's acquittal. Conservative MP David Davis, a former shadow home secretary, called for an urgent review, saying there was \"a risk of a serious injustice\" under the current system. Mr Davis said: \"This case has highlighted serious concerns over how the police and the Crown Prosecution Service bring sexual offence cases to court. \"In particular we must now review the process whereby the police and the Crown Prosecution Service put together a large number of lesser, subsidiary cases in order to reinforce one serious case when prosecuting sexual offences.\" Christine Hamilton, wife of former Conservative MP Neil Hamilton, accused the CPS of wasting taxpayers' money. Mrs Hamilton and her husband were arrested in 2001 by police investigating an allegation of rape which turned out to be entirely false.  Mrs Hamilton told the BBC she believed the CPS and police were on a mission to target high-profile figures because they felt \"guilt-ridden\" in the wake of the Jimmy Savile inquiry. She said there had been a \"mini torrent\" of arrests, which had wasted money and \"destroyed\" lives, including Mr Evans's. \"How much has this cost? And could that money not be better spent by the CPS and the police in pursuing real criminals?\" she said. Mrs Hamilton said there had been \"two or three\" witnesses who did not consider themselves \"victims\". \"The CPS, if they knew that, why on earth did they bring these people to court?\" she added. But director of public prosecutions Ms Saunders said research had found that victims did not always see themselves as victims, citing domestic abuse as an example.  She said the CPS prosecuted more than 730,000 cases each year and had a conviction rate of 86%. \"If a case satisfies the evidential test and it's in the public interest to prosecute it, we will prosecute,\" she said. \"And it would be wrong and we would be rightly criticised if we didn't take cases just because we were being overly cautious and we would be failing in our duty to victims and society.\" Mr Evans was cleared of a string of sex abuse charges, including one of rape. The rape claim was among several allegations made by seven men during a five-week trial at Preston Crown Court. Mr Evans was said to have used his political influence to take advantage of his alleged victims but the defence pointed out inconsistencies in various witness accounts. The former Conservative MP, 56, currently sits as the independent member for Ribble Valley.

{"article": "The government's \"overblown rhetoric\" on efforts to bring down immigration has contributed to a drop in students doing technology, engineering and maths courses at UK universities, peers say. The Lords Science and Technology Committee said \"inflammatory\" media coverage and people's \"perception of the rules\" were a deterrent. The UK was seen as an \"unwelcoming destination\", it added. But the government said the peers' report lacked \"clear evidence\". It said it was controlling immigration while \"attracting the brightest and the best\". Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wants to get the level of net migration - the difference between the number of people coming in and leaving - down to \"tens of thousands\" by 2015. Since April 2012, foreign students have faced stricter visa regulations, in an effort to cut down on bogus immigrants. But the government stresses that there is no cap on the number of people legitimately coming to the UK to study. The number of students studying science, technology and maths (Stem) subjects - including courses such as medicine, architecture and computer science - fell  by more than 10% from 58,815 in 2010-11 to 52,905 in 2012-13. The committee's report said: \"It was put to us on numerous occasions that it was not the immigration rules as such that were deterring students, but their perception of the rules as a result of overblown rhetoric from ministers and sometimes inflammatory media coverage in the UK and in overseas countries.\" It added: \"The UK was seen as a destination that was unwelcoming to some international students.\" But the report said the evidence \"pointed to difficulties beyond simply those of perception\", with the \"complexity and instability\" of the immigration rules also posing problems. \"The UK's offer to prospective international students remains a good one; it is founded on academic excellence, but it has been diminished by perceived and real barriers so that the overall offer is not as competitive as it needs to be,\" the peers said. Ministers have set out plans to increase the number of international students by up to 20% over the next five years. But the committee said: \"The government maintain that they emphatically welcome international students, unfortunately, elements of policy and perception are working against this admirable aim. \"The view within government that current policies are working well is disconnected from the concerns we repeatedly heard.\" But a Home Office spokesman said: \"We do not accept that the UK's immigration rules are deterring international students and there is no clear evidence in the report to support that argument - where some courses and countries have seen falling numbers, other countries and courses are on the rise.\" He said the UK remained \"the second most popular destination for international higher education students\", with enrolments from \"key markets\", such as China, Malaysia and Hong Kong increasing. The spokesman added: \"The student visa system we inherited was weak and open to widespread abuse. We are controlling immigration while still attracting the brightest and the best - as the published figures show.\" ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26980384", "title": ["Immigration rhetoric putting off overseas students - peers"]},

His remarks were criticised as \"highly dangerous\" by Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers.  Lord Tebbit said he now regretted the trouble his comments had caused.

{"article": "MPs scared of negative publicity are \"secretly\" recruiting unpaid interns to work in their offices, it is alleged. Charles Glover, an aide to Lib Dem MP John Leech, made the claim while defending his boss, who has come under fire for advertising eight unpaid roles. Campaigners say some MPs are exploiting people by not paying the minimum wage. But Mr Glover says interns gain valuable experience that helps them get paid jobs at Westminster. The number of MPs advertising for unpaid office staff on the official Commons job board  has dramatically fallen in recent years after a spate of negative publicity.  The expenses watchdog, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), has  , with MPs now told anyone working for them must be paid the national minimum wage, and that only genuine volunteers can support them unpaid. Mr Glover said MPs could not afford to pay all the staff they need, and previous applicants from humble backgrounds had gone on to forge careers in politics, after he was criticised by campaigner Tanya de Grunwald on her Graduate Fog blog. He said Mr Leech was being open about his recruitment of unpaid staff - in contrast to other MPs, who were recruiting people \"secretly\" because they were worried about a media backlash. Campaigns against unpaid interns were driving the recruitment process underground, further entrenching the Westminster \"closed shop\" that voters say they hate, he argued. \"People are applying directly and getting taken on directly,\" he told BBC News. \"I know it happens. I know people that it has happened to. But they are loath to say it in public. I also know it is being used to push down wages. \"People who used to get a Westminster wage are now getting a minimum intern wage.\" Unpaid internships exploit those who do them and exclude those who can't afford to do them\u201d In his advert, Mr Leech, the Member for Withington, in Manchester, offered full-time roles for three months or 12 months part-time, to include training in everything from speechwriting and media work to managing the MP's diary. It called for \"computer and writing skills\", an \"energetic can-do attitude\" and \"excellent interpersonal skills and a sense of humour\". But it also stressed that it was a voluntary role and \"as such there are no set hours and responsibilities, and you should be free to come and go as you wish\". Kelley Ireland, 22, a paid parliamentary aide to Lib Dem peer Baroness Williams, said she had got her foot on the Westminster career ladder by answering an advert for an unpaid volunteer in Mr Leech's Manchester office. Ms Ireland, who says she did not come from a political family and attended a state school, worked as a carer to support herself while volunteering for a year at Mr Leech's Manchester and London offices. \"I was just so glad to have the opportunity to work in his office, and I was willing to work in the evenings and at weekends in order to do that, and I didn't ever begrudge him for that. I learned so much in that period,\" she told BBC News. She said MPs should be paid a greater staff allowance to allow them to pay their interns - otherwise interns would increasingly be recruited \"in secret\" without a public application process.  \"There's quite a few people I know within Westminster now who are doing internships purely because of who they know and because they know someone in that office. They come in one day a week, or several days.\" She said unpaid internships were not being advertised in the way they had been in the past because they are seen as \"toxic\". But she added: \"You need the experience to get a paid job.\" Tanya de Grunwald, who first reported Mr Leech's latest job ads, placing them on her blog's   - said there could be no excuse for not paying workers. \"The claim that many of Leech's fellow MPs are now hiring unpaid interns secretly is shocking - but so is the claim that their grubby behaviour is somehow the fault of campaigners like me,\" she told BBC News.  \"MPs, including Leech, must understand that the law is the law - and public opinion is against them on this one.\" She added: \"Unpaid internships exploit those who do them and exclude those who can't afford to do them. End of story.\" Former Labour minister Hazel Blears has called for unpaid internships to be made illegal. A spokesman for the Salford and Eccles MP said she had not been made aware of any MPs attempting to get round the rules by recruiting interns informally. \"If it was happening, that would obviously be a concern. But it does not mean that we should allow the potential exploitation of people. \"You have got to deal with one problem at a time.\" He said some people may be able to support themselves financially while working in an MP's office but many more would not be able to and would, therefore, be excluded from a career in politics. Ms Blears is encouraging people of all ages to apply for a paid internship in Parliament through the , which is backed by commercial sponsors including Royal Mail and construction company CH2M Hill.

{"article": "Irish President Michael D Higgins has flown home after the end of his historic four-day state visit to the UK. The Queen hosted two banquets for her Irish guest at Windsor Castle and he addressed both Houses of Parliament. Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina visited Stratford-upon-Avon and Coventry on their final day. Before leaving for Dublin Mr Higgins said he had been moved by the reception he and his wife had received. He also told those who were unhappy with the visit to \"think of all the things we have in common\". And when he was asked about the involvement of former IRA leader Martin McGuinness in the visit, Mr Higgins said it was \"very important that all those involved participated fully\". Mr McGuinness, who is Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, attended the state banquet on Tuesday and joined in the toast to the Queen. The Sinn F\u00e9in MLA said his participation in the royal reception was in aid of \"conflict resolution and reconciliation\". The presidential visit was aimed at celebrating and strengthening British and Irish links. It followed the Queen's first state visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, which was widely hailed as a diplomatic triumph and a milestone in Anglo-Irish relations. Mr and Mrs Higgins said goodbye to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Windsor Castle on Friday morning, before leaving for their final engagements. They travelled to Stratford-upon-Avon to visit the birthplace of William Shakespeare and the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). In addition to his political career, Mr Higgins is a well-known poet and author, while his wife is an actress. President Higgins made a speech about the English language, its role in Ireland, and about the shared dialogue between two islands.  He said: \"It is the business of living souls to breathe life into words, and I have no doubt but that our long conversation in a shared language will continue into the far future to breathe new life, and the lightning of our different imaginations, into a common human purpose.\" Approximately 2,000 people turned out in warm spring sunshine to see the arrival of Irish President Michael D Higgins in Coventry.  The atmosphere was joyful as the city's large Irish population gathered and a cheer went up as the president stepped out of his gleaming car.  He smiled warmly and waved to the crowd, between greeting various city and cathedral dignitaries.  It is a very proud day for Coventry, one that onlooker Bridget Connelly, originally from Galway, thought would never happen. \"It's fantastic. It was just a dream of mine. He was so warmly welcomed,\" she said. Her daughter, Patricia Southall, added: \"Diplomatically there must have been hard work to get here. I'm sure it'll do a lot of good in the future.\" Mr Higgins was later presented with The Complete Works of Shakespeare, signed by the acting company, and he gifted the RSC a copy of The Book of Kells. They then travelled to Coventry for a tour of its current cathedral and the ruins of the old building that was bombed during World War II. They also attended a reception for members of the Irish community at St Mary's Guildhall in the city. During his four-day tour, Mr Higgins met Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at Buckingham Palace. He also attended several events marking the contribution of the Irish community to public life in Britain.  They included business leaders, charity workers and NHS staff. On Thursday evening, the president attended a concert celebrating Irish music and culture at London's Royal Albert Hall.  At the event, Mr Higgins thanked the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh for their \"gracious welcome and warm hospitality\" throughout his UK trip.  He said the preparation they had made for his state visit was \"reflective of the true and deep friendship that now exists between Ireland and the United Kingdom\".

{"article": "Scotch whisky exports stagnated last year, as sales were hit by slowing demand in China and other emerging markets. Figures from the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) showed overseas sales remained flat at \u00a34.3bn by value. In volume terms, exports increased by 2.5% to the equivalent of 1.23 billion bottles.  Scotch whisky performed strongly in the US, Mexico and India but direct exports to China fell by nearly 30% to \u00a351m.  Sales to Taiwan, South Korea and Japan also fell in value, by between 13% and 15%.  We've heard from individual distillers that the fall-off in the Chinese market has a lot to do with official government disapproval of conspicuous consumption, and a crackdown on the culture of business gifts, as they easily cross the line into corruption. It's a challenge that has hit the premium and luxury goods market in quite a big way.  The best performers included the US, which saw exports of Scotch grow 8% on 2012 to a record \u00a3819m.  The US was by far the largest market for whisky by value.  France remained the largest volume market for Scotch.  SWA said sales there rose by 16% as the market recovered following a tax hike on spirits at the start of 2012. India,  which is now Scotch whisky's fourth biggest market by volume, saw the value of whisky sales climb by 12% to \u00a369m.  SWA said it hoped EU-India Free Trade Agreement negotiations would restart following this year's Indian elections, leading to a reduction of the current 150% import tariff. Exports to Brazil and Mexico grew by about 20% - to \u00a399m in Brazil and \u00a3110m in Mexico. A career in the British diplomatic service means David Frost is schooled in the art of choosing his words carefully. The Scotch Whisky Association's chief executive has concerns about independence but he is careful not to overstate them, insisting the vote is a \"decision for the people of Scotland,\" not for its companies. Nonetheless, Mr Frost is seeking \"reassurances\" about the \"risks\" of a 'yes' vote. In the SWA's sunny boardroom in Edinburgh he told me he was concerned that the Scottish government's white paper on independence \"talks of a network of 70 to 90 overseas embassies,\" compared to \"getting on for 200 posts\" in the existing UK diplomatic service. According to the SWA, Scotch whisky represents about 85% of Scottish food and drink exports and about one quarter of the British total, with the industry's exports worth \u00a3135 a second to the UK balance of trade. \"It is important that an independent Scotland gives the same kind of support to the industry and finds ways of doing it that are comparable to what we have now,\" said Mr Frost. \"We're confident this industry is going to succeed whatever the situation after the 18th of September. So we are concerned about the conditions in which we would be operating. We see some risks. We want reassurances. But are we going  to be successful? Yes, you bet.\" In January, spirits producer Diageo reported slowing sales in China and other emerging markets. The company said new rules over gift-giving and spending by Chinese officials dented sales in the country by 66%.  SWA chief executive David Frost said: \"Scotch whisky exports remain strong and the industry's impressive performance makes a major contribution to the UK's trade performance.  \"The unprecedented investment programmes in Scotch whisky by producers show that in the long term they are confident that demand will continue to grow.   \"However, in the short run, there are some economic headwinds. Formal and informal barriers to trade remain.\"  He added: \"We should remember that the industry's success does not come automatically but is based on hard work, investment and careful stewardship.\"  Mr Frost also made a plea for strong government backing for the industry. He said: \"As a former ambassador, I know that the industry also depends on strong political support from government, for example to influence European Union negotiations on our behalf or to press other countries to allow better access to their markets.  \"Both the UK and Scottish governments have played an important role in this so far.\"  He added: \"Whatever the outcome of the Scottish referendum, as an industry exporting to around 200 markets we will continue to need the backing of an effective diplomatic network with the necessary global reach, commercial expertise, and capacity to influence.\"     Overall, Scotch whisky accounts for about 85% of Scottish food and drink exports and nearly a quarter of the British total.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he was not a \"career politician\" The leader of the Welsh Conservatives has told party members they must be open to a \"coalition of ideas\". Andrew RT Davies said the party - which has been in opposition since the Assembly was created in 1999 - needed to listen to ideas from outside. His words will be seen as a hint the party could be open to forming a coalition with other parties after the assembly elections in 2016. Mr Davies called the current Welsh Labour government \"lazy\" and \"tired\".  \"I believe Welsh Conservatives are mature enough to look at that coalition of ideas, to look where the best ideas can come from, and to date they've come from the Welsh Conservatives,\" he said during the second day of the Welsh Conservative conference in Llangollen. \"It means reaching out to anyone who has the best interests of the people of Wales at heart and wants to get us off the bottom of the league table whether it be in health, education or the economy, rather than this over-lording mentality Labour has.\" Over the last few months Mr Davies has faced difficult situations and in February he sacked four members of his shadow cabinet for rebelling against him in a vote on devolving income tax. He admitted there had been internal divisions within his party for years but in his speech on Saturday he called on members to have self belief.  \"We have hope, we have ambition and above all we have the hope and ambition for the country we seek to lead,\" he said. \"I want my team to keep believing that we can keep on making that difference and build that coalition of ideas that we need to put in place to solve the problems of Wales.\" On some measures, education in Wales is no better than in some of the eastern European nations emerging from decades of communism\u201d Earlier, Welsh Secretary David Jones accused the Labour-led Welsh government of letting down an entire generation of young people, due to a \"continuing decline in the education system\". Mr Jones has attacked Labour's record on education at the Welsh Conservative conference in Llangollen. It follows an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on the Welsh education system.  The report praised \"positive\" learning conditions but found many weaknesses. \"Wales lacks a compelling and inclusive long-term education vision to steer the education system and its reform efforts,\" Mr Jones said at the second day of the conference. The most recent Pisa international education tests, which are run by the OECD, ranked Wales bottom in the UK. The 2012 Pisa tests in science, maths and reading were taken by 500,000 15-year-olds in 68 countries. \"The Pisa statistics published recently were, frankly, shocking,\" Mr Jones added. \"They showed Wales to be the weakest of the home nations in maths, science and reading. \"On some measures, education in Wales is no better than in some of the eastern European nations emerging from decades of communism.\"  Mr Jones argued that good education is crucial in a wholly global economy and to compete in that market the young people of Wales needed an \"excellent education\". During the conference Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith spoke about his party's welfare reform.  \"I have fought so hard to create and introduce Universal Credit, now running in England, Scotland and Wales - in Shotton from 7 April - and set to roll out further across the north west,\" he said.  Universal Credit is replacing six benefits, including jobseeker's allowance, income support, child tax credit and housing benefit. He said the behavioural effect of the reform was \"striking\" and allowed more people to enter the workforce. \"Across the UK, there are now a lower proportion of workless households than at any time on record, down 450,000 since 2010, and down 23,000 in Wales,\" Mr Duncan Smith said. Addressing the conference on Friday, David Cameron attacked the Welsh government's handling of the NHS. He said Wales was witnessing a \"national scandal\" as Offa's Dyke \"has become the line between life and death\".  UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also launched his strongest attack on the NHS in Wales, claiming it is \"sleepwalking to a Mid Staffs tragedy\". He criticised Wales' record on waiting times and ambulance targets.

{"article": "An Army commando regiment will now not be axed but cut in size, the Ministry of Defence has announced. 24 Commando Engineer Regiment, based at Chivenor in Devon, is now to be retained, having previously been threatened with disbandment under MoD plans to cut 20,000 Army posts by 2020. The reduction of the regiment's 340 personnel is expected to come from those in temporary posts, it said. The changes are expected to be in place by July 2015 at the latest. In July 2012, it was announced the regiment could be axed in plans to reduce the size of the army from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 personnel. But armed forces minister Mark Francois told MPs, in a written statement: \"At the time of the Army 2020 announcement, the army acknowledged that engagement with the Royal Navy was still ongoing, and this would refine the allocation of army manpower available to support Royal Navy tasks. \"This process is now complete and it has been decided that 24 Commando Engineer Regiment will be retained although the regiment will be reduced in size. \"This change will be achieved by rebalancing army manpower within 3 Commando Brigade and allows for the best use of available resources to deliver the strategic defence and security review and Army 2020 capability.\" The regiment was created in 2008 to support Plymouth-based 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and has been deployed twice to Afghanistan. North Devon Liberal Democrat MP Nick Harvey said the government had recognised \"how valuable the skills of regiments like 24 Royal Engineers are to the Royal Marines\". \"I look forward to seeing a smaller but no less important 24 Engineers Regiment playing an active role at the base once again,\" he said.

{"article": "UKIP MEPs are untrustworthy and do not stand up for the UK in Europe, David Cameron has said. The PM took direct aim at the party aiming to overtake the Tories in May's Euro elections, saying they seldom \"bothered to vote\" in Brussels. He was speaking at the launch of the Conservative European and English local election campaign. UKIP accused him of \"unfairly insulting millions of voters\", many of whom \"normally back his own party\".  Mr Cameron is seeking to shift the focus from ex-culture secretary Maria Miller's expenses to the EU-wide polls, which are scheduled for 22 May in the UK. In a speech at Manchester airport, he categorised his rivals in \"two extremist camps\", with one professing love for the EU, and the other hate.  Both camps were neglecting the UK's national interest, he argued, re-iterating his pledge to reform the UK's relationship with the EU and hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives win a majority at the 2015 general election.  \"If you want real change in Europe that works for you, for your family, for your business, then the Conservative Party is the only party which can deliver for you,\" Mr Cameron said.   He directed specific criticism at Labour, who he accused of having signed off \"power to Brussels, summit after summit\", and the Lib Dems, who he said were \"absolutely devoted to their dream of ever closer union\".  But his strongest broadside was reserved for UKIP, which campaigns for the UK to leave the EU - and which Mr Cameron has tended to avoid attacking at length in previous campaign speeches.  It's been a difficult week for David Cameron, with Maria Miller resigning because of a row over her expenses. Today's speech was about giving a rallying call six weeks before the European elections. After the Budget the Conservatives seemed to be riding high but the situation surrounding Mrs Miller changed that. We've had head-to-head TV debates between  Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg. Did Mr Cameron make a mistake by not taking part, having seen Mr Farage pick up points in the polls? Today Mr Cameron branded those who say we should leave the EU immediately and those who say the EU should remain unchanged as extremists. May's election will be an interesting indicator as to whether voters are more convinced by Mr Cameron's position or those he dismisses. \"When it comes to standing up for Britain in Europe, is there anyone you would trust less than a group of UKIP MEPs?\" he asked.    \"They talk the talk in Britain, but as soon as they're on that plane to Brussels they change completely. When they do actually bother to vote, they don't stand up for Britain. Indeed their own leader has said they cannot change a thing in Brussels. \"In contrast, we are the only party with a clear plan. Renegotiate. Get the best deal for Britain. Then put the decision to the British people.\"  Responding to the comments, UKIP's director of communications Patrick O'Flynn said: \"By branding anyone who wants to get Britain out of the EU an extremist, David Cameron is not only unfairly insulting millions of UKIP voters but also doing the same to more than half of those who normally back his own party.  \"Anyone who thinks Britain would be better off coming out of the EU and thereby restoring the ability to control its own borders now knows what to do on May 22nd: vote UKIP and cause a political earthquake.  \"Wanting your own country to be self-governing once again is not an extreme position but just plain common sense.\" The clashes come in the wake of a protracted row over Mrs Miller's position.  She resigned as culture secretary after admitting that she had wrongly claimed \u00a35,800 for mortgage interest and apologising for the way she handled an inquiry into her expenses.  The PM had repeatedly defended her. Earlier,   that Chancellor George Osborne led a \"revolt to force Miller out\", but Downing Street sources said this was \"rubbish\".  Mr Cameron said he was \"very sorry\" to accept her resignation on Wednesday morning, telling her she should be \"extremely proud\" of her work in government.  Mrs Miller has been replaced by the Conservative MP for Bromsgrove Sajid Javid, an ally of the chancellor who was promoted from his previous job as Financial Secretary to the Treasury.  The Times said his elevation had been \"taken as evidence of a further strengthening of Mr Osborne's grip on government\" - and that Mr Osborne and Tory election chief Lynton Crosby had warned about the damage being done to the party's electoral prospects by the row.  On Wednesday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited Mrs Miller's Basingstoke constituency, arguing that the row \"reflected very badly on David Cameron\". \"He has completely misjudged the public mood on this,\" Mr Farage said.  Labour leader Ed Miliband also accused Mr Cameron of a \"terrible error of judgement\" in failing to sack her sooner. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Michael Fabricant has also been sacked, from his post as the party's vice-chairman, partly for tweeting that it was \"about time\" Mrs Miller resigned. The active user of the social media site said he had been asked to resign and refused, so was sacked \"over HS2 and my views on a recent cabinet minister\".

{"article": "Philip Atkins and Roger Lawrence are lifelong friends.  They first met as schoolboys at Denstone College in north Staffordshire, more years ago than either of them care to recall, and their very different career paths have eventually led them in remarkably similar directions. They both now lead large local authorities which find themselves the closest of collaborators on the most ambitious of projects -  Close to the border between our biggest shire county and one of our big city authorities is the Midlands' most ambitious economic regeneration venture. The i54 site extends over 226 acres. It's where cutting-edge manufacturers, including Moog and Jaguar Land Rover, are creating over 2,000 jobs - JLR alone is spending \u00a3500m on its giant engine factory there. At the heart of the initiative is a partnership between three local authorities: South Staffordshire is the district authority responsible not only for the planning of the site but also for the local business rates which will go into the i54 mix.  But ours is the story of the two councils who are co-funding the site in general, and in particular, the construction of a new junction 2 on the M54 motorway, due to open at the end of this year at a cost of \u00a338m.    Partners though councillors Atkins and Lawrence may be, they are also political polar opposites. As Staffordshire's Conservative leader, Mr Atkins has responded to year-after-year of budgetary austerity by embracing the process of merging and sharing services.  He says local government has a way to go yet in terms of working smarter and forging new partnerships like the ones he is working on with the police and healthcare agencies.  His is an upper-tier council which is responsible for strategic services like education, refuse disposal and highways. The authority is maintaining a freeze on council tax. Labour-controlled Wolverhampton, by contrast, is increasing its council tax by just under the 2% that would otherwise have triggered a referendum. It is one of the councils parodied by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles as \"democracy dodgers\".  Leader Roger Lawrence points out that his authority faces a vastly heavier burden supporting concentrations of the weakest and poorest in the community than more affluent areas like Staffordshire; and that they also have proportionately less revenue-raising potential.  He was recently forced to announce 2,000 council jobs losses as part of \u00a3123m savings over five years. No wonder the two councils display such contrasting philosophies. Mr Atkins sees the evolution of local government as a continuing process, Mr Lawrence makes clear that in an ideal world [which for him includes a Labour government] he would hope to reverse at least some of the austerity measures he himself has introduced. Local library opening hours have been reduced to 24 a week but it would obviously be a relatively straightforward matter to restore full-time opening when and if the council's budgets allow.  I was delighted when councillors Atkins and Lawrence accepted my invitation to meet me at i54 to air their differences and consider the way forward.  What followed was a stimulating and thought-provoking conversation which you will be able to see for yourself. It will be one of our main talking points in this weekend's Sunday Politics Midlands. The council leaders were brave enough to join me. I hope you will be too.

{"article": "It was like a Game of Thrones moment. But rather than a warning of the dread dark winter, this had a real political touch: \"Devolution is coming.\" The Ned Stark character on this occasion was the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Labour's Alan Rhodes. \"I welcome greater devolution,\" he told me. \"Undoubtedly, we can find local solutions to local issues in a much more effective way than Whitehall ever could.\" Unlike Ned Stark, Alan Rhodes won't lose his political head over this. But his next comments might stir things up. \"We need more tax-raising powers and planning ought to be left entirely to local government. Whether it's education or social care, we know what our local needs are.\" So why is devolution for England being scripted on the political agenda?  Back to a Game of Thrones plot line: politicians in England are already looking beyond The Wall -Hadrian's Wall - and weighing up options should the Scots vote for independence. Whatever the result, local government leaders in England expect any new constitutional settlement to beef up regions again. Lord Heseltine kicked the ball rolling in his 2012 report - No Stone Unturned - on giving so-called city regions more economic clout. \"Besides neutering local leadership, the monopoly of Whitehall is dysfunctional on two counts,\" he said. \"First, too many decisions are taken in London without a real understanding of the particular, and differing, circumstances of the communities affected. \"And second, with responsibilities divided up between policy departments, no-one in government is tasked to look holistically at the full range of issues facing a particular area.\" The Labour leader Ed Miliband warmed to the English devolution theme in a significant speech in Birmingham.  He also wants more powers for our big cities. He proposed creating a minister for each English region, acting as a bridge between Whitehall and the region. If it sounds familiar, then it is. During the last Labour government, the East Midlands had its own regional minister. Remember Phil Hope and Gillian Merron? The coalition scrapped Labour's regional apparatus and replaced it all with more localised business-political organisations, the Local Enterprise Partnerships, to steer economic regeneration. \"Michael Heseltine's review called for a massive devolution of funding from Whitehall to the cities,\" the Labour leader told his Birmingham audience. \"But David Cameron and George Osborne allocated just \u00a32bn. The best report this government has produced has been the one they have most ignored. We can and must do a lot better than that.\" What is uncertain in all this is whether devolution to city regions, like greater Nottingham, is welcomed by the Treasury or whether this idea will be squashed once the Treasury takes fright at losing power over the purse-strings. As the Stark family learnt the hard way in Game of Thrones, trying to win control over a southern-based political power block may not have a happy ending.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. In full: Prime Minister David Cameron's speech on Europe David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech ( ) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to \"bring back\" powers to Westminster from Brussels.  For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are   from the speech. The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be \"brought back\" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: \"We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK.\" The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.  David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: \"Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest?  I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market.\" Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a \"chilling effect\" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it \"game, set and match\" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.  The BBC has compiled  . Here is a round-up of  . The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off \"leaving gracefully\". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said \"cherry picking is not an option\". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said:  \"We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'.\" Read  . A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU.  The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said \"closer union of the eurozone is not for us\" but Mr Cameron \"rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU\".

He has faced criticism from some on the right of the party but Mr Cameron has insisted the coalition will see through its full five-year term. Before becoming leader, he was the Conservatives' campaign co-ordinator at the 2005 general election and shadow education secretary. He was special adviser to Home Secretary Michael Howard and Chancellor Norman Lamont in the 1990s before spending seven years as a public relations executive with commercial broadcaster Carlton. In just five years, Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, a contemporary of Mr Cameron, went from political obscurity to the absolute front line of British politics. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter becoming MP for Sheffield Hallam at the 2005 election, he was promoted to Europe spokesman, before moving on to the home affairs role. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWhen Sir Menzies Campbell resigned as leader in 2007, he entered the race to succeed him, in the end narrowly beating Chris Huhne. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe really came to prominence during the televised debates ahead of the general election, being judged in polls to have been the big winner of the first one. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, this appeared to do little to help the Lib Dems when they actually lost seats on 6 May. The party, though, retained enough MPs to become the vital players in the hung parliament. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter taking his party into coalition with the Conservatives - and U-turning on a previous pledge to reject university tuition fees - Mr Clegg saw his personal poll ratings slump, but he has pointed to areas where Lib Dem policies have come into force on taxation and consitutional issues. \r\r\n\r\r\nLike David Cameron, he has insisted the coalition is working in the national interest and will continue for the full parliament. One of David Cameron's closest friends and Conservative allies, George Osborne rose rapidly after becoming MP for Tatton in 2001. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMichael Howard promoted him from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury to shadow chancellor in May 2005, at the age of 34. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Osborne took a key role in the election campaign and even before Mr Cameron became leader the two were being likened to Labour's Blair/Brown duo. The two have emulated them by becoming prime minister and chancellor, but have avoided the spats. \r\r\n\r\r\nSome prominent Conservatives have urged Mr Osborne to do more to promote economic growth. \r\r\n\r\r\nBefore entering Parliament, he was a special adviser in the agriculture department when the Tories were in government and later served as political secretary to William Hague.\r\r\n Theresa May is the second woman to hold the post of Home Secretary. \r\r\n\r\r\nShe was the first woman to become Conservative Party chairman, under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith. \r\r\n\r\r\nShe then took up the culture and family portfolios before being made shadow Commons leader by David Cameron. \r\r\nShe has been a keen advocate of positive action to recruit more women Tories to winnable seats and was a key architect of the \"A list\" of preferred candidates. \r\r\n\r\r\nA passionate moderniser, she famously ruffled feathers when she told Tory activists they were seen as members of the \"nasty party\". \r\r\nIn her role as home secretary, she has overseen widespread changes to the immigration system. \r\r\n\r\r\nMrs May was the shadow work and pensions minister ahead of the election. Since he returned to frontline politics in 2005, Conservative William Hague has become a key adviser to David Cameron, and was seen as de facto deputy party leader. \r\r\nThe foreign secretary has plenty of experience to call upon, having been Tory leader himself from 1997 to 2001 and shadow foreign secretary until the election. \r\r\n\r\r\nA witty and engaging Commons performer who is popular with grassroots Tory members, Mr Hague entered Parliament in 1989 having been special adviser to Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe. He was soon promoted to be a social security minister and in 1995 entered the cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales. \r\r\n\r\r\nIn addition to his duties as shadow foreign secretary, Mr Cameron put Mr Hague in charge of rebuilding the party in the North of England, as chairman of its Northern Board. Vince Cable has had a long journey to reach the front rank of politics, having been a Labour and then an SDP supporter before its merger with the Liberals to become the Liberal Democrats. \r\r\n\r\r\nAn economist by profession, he entered Parliament as MP for Twickenham in 1997 and has gradually built up his powerbase among the Lib Dems. \r\r\nAs the party's deputy leader and Treasury spokesman he saw his stock rising during the credit crunch because of his earlier warnings. \r\r\n\r\r\nWhen he stood in as temporary leader after the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell, he memorably described Gordon Brown as going from \"Stalin to Mr Bean\". \r\r\n\r\r\nHas had a colourful time in government, notably when he was recorded by under cover reporters saying he was at war with Rupert Murdoch's News International. He has been mentioned as a possible future leader of his party. \r\r\n\tSir George Young was replaced as leader of the Commons by Andrew Lansley in the September 2012 reshuffle, but was recalled and given the Chief Whip post a few weeks later following the resignation of Andrew Mitchell.\r\r\n \r\r\n\tSir George, 71 at the time of his return to the cabinet, is one of the most experienced members of the government and has served a number of roles in Conservative administrations since the 1970s. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tHe was elected as MP for Acton in 1974 and became a junior minister in the Thatcher government in 1979. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tIn 1994 he became Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and was promoted a year later to transport secretary. Switching seats to North West Hampshire in 1997, he was given the shadow Commons leader's job in the Tory opposition the same year.\r\r\n \r\r\n\tFrom 2001-09 he served as chairman of the Standards and Priveleges committee, which required him to ajudicate allegations of MPs misconduct. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tSir George was educated at Christ Church Oxford and is married with two sons and two daughters. He is a keen cyclist and received the nickname \"the bicycling baronet\" after appearing in a British Rail advert promoting the transport of bikes on trains.\r\n\t\t\t Eric Pickles was first elected to the Commons in 1992, representing an Essex seat far from his Yorkshire roots. \r\r\n \r\r\nHe has extensive local government experience, having led Bradford District Council for three years up to 1991.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe has also served in a variety of shadow ministerial roles, including transport, local government and social security spokesman, earning a reputation for loyalty and good humour.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe boosted his reputation and profile in the party by masterminding its landmark victory over Labour in the Crewe and Nantwich by-election and was appointed party chairman in 2009.\r\r\n \r\r\nAnd he became a regular and confident media performer in the months leading up to the 2010 general election. Mr Shapps, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, since 2001, has made a name for himself as a keen and frequent media performer.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn his twenties he started a printing company.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn 2005, Mr Shapps became a deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, experience which will be useful in his new job as chairman.\r\r\n \r\r\nUntil the reshuffle, he served as housing minister, a role without full cabinet status but one which allowed him to attend meetings. A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, Sajiv Javid is the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He became an MP in 2010 and is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. He was a City banker and became a Treasury minister in 2013. Philip Hammond has built up a reputation as an articulate and effective Commons performer since being elected MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in 1997. \r\r\n\r\r\nA former director of companies supplying medical equipment, he was initially a member of the Conservative shadow health team before going on to serve as trade and industry spokesman. He also backed Michael Portillo's 2001 leadership bid. \r\r\n\r\r\nIn summer 2002, he went to shadow the now defunct Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government department before being made shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, at the age of 51, in the July 2007 reshuffle. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe became Transport Secretary after David Cameron's coalition took power after the 2010 election, building on his reputation there as an effective performer before being shifted into the defence brief after the resignation of Liam Fox from the job in October 2011. Tory Michael Gove was seen as one of the brightest talents in the 2005 intake. The former Times journalist is a key member of David Cameron's inner circle who helps write many of his speeches. \r\r\n\r\r\nAs the Tories' housing spokesman, Mr Gove made a name for himself as an effective Commons performer in attacks on the government's home information packs. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe was drafted into the shadow cabinet as children, schools and families spokesman, at the age of 39 when his leader split the education brief in two to reflect Gordon Brown's Whitehall changes. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Gove headed the Policy Exchange think tank for three years before landing the safe seat of Surrey Heath. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe had previously said he was prepared to give up a post in the new cabinet to ensure the deal with the Lib Dems went ahead, but he stuck with the education brief in government bringing forward a series of radical changes such as free schools and exam reforms. Liberal Democrat Ed Davey was appointed Energy and Climate Change Secretary on 3 February 2012 following the resignation of Chris Huhne.  \r\r\nMr Davey was elected MP for the newly created seat of Kingston in 1997 and has held a series of frontbench roles. Popular within the party, he was seen as an outside contender to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell when he stood down in 2007. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter serving as the Liberal Democrat spokesman for foreign affairs prior to the 2010 election, he was appointed business minister responsible for the Post Office, Royal Mail and employment relations in the coalition government.  Conservative MP Owen Paterson covered the Northern Ireland portfolio in opposition and in government before being moved to environment in David Cameron's reshuffle. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe entered the shadow cabinet for the first time, at the age of 50, in David Cameron's July 2007 reshuffle. \r\r\nA former managing director of the British Leather company, he entered Parliament as MP for Shropshire North in 1997, concentrating on rural issues as a junior agriculture spokesman and chairman of the Conservative Rural Action Group. \r\r\n\r\r\nA Eurosceptic and member of the right wing Cornerstone Group, which campaigns for traditional Tory values, he helped Iain Duncan Smith during his 2001 leadership bid and was briefly parliamentary private secretary to Ann Widdecombe. He has also served in the Opposition whips office. Jeremy Hunt was moved to the health brief after the overseeing the smooth running of the 2012 London Olympics. \r\r\nThe MP for South West Surrey since 2005, he became the Conservatives' culture spokesman in 2007. He was previously the party's spokesman on disabilities and welfare reform. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Hunt, a fluent Japanese speaker, founded a company called Hotcourses, offering guides to help students find the right course before entering university. \r\r\n\r\r\nAs culture secretary he had a chequered time, coming under pressure over his dealings with Rupert Murdoch's News International takeover bid. Justine Greening was promoted to the cabinet in October 2011 at the age of 42. \r\r\n\r\r\nMiss Greening, the MP for Putney since 2005, became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.\r\r\n \r\r\nBorn and educated in Yorkshire, Miss Greening studied economics at Southampton University, before getting an MBA from London Business School and worked as a finance manager at British Gas owner Centrica before joining the Commons.\r\r\n \r\r\nHer move from transport was widely perceived to be a result of her vocal opposition to the idea of a third runway being built at Heathrow. Chris Grayling's elevation to the post of Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary represented something of a comeback. \r\r\nPrior to the 2010 general election he had been shadow home secretary but, when the coalition was formed, he was made employment minister, rather than given a cabinet role. \r\r\n\r\r\nSeen as being on the right of the party, Mr Grayling's appointment to the justice role will be intended to reassure some Conservatives who were unhappy at predecessor Ken Clarke's prison reforms, claiming they were too lenient on criminals. \r\r\n\r\r\nEducated at Cambridge University, he is a former BBC News producer and the author of books on subjects including the Bridgewater Canal and Anglo-American relations. A former barrister, Ms Villiers was elected MP for Chipping Barnet in 2005. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power. \r\r\n \r\r\nA self-described Eurosceptic, she takes over from Owen Paterson in the post of Northern Ireland Secretary. Mr Carmichael has been appointed Scottish Secretary in the government's latest reshuffle. He replaces Michael Moore - a leading figure in the No campaign for the Scottish independence referendum. Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, has been the Lib Dems' chief whip and a government deputy chief whip since the formation of the coalition. He was previously the party's Scottish spokesman. Born in 1965, Mr Carmichael had a traditional upbringing on a hill farm on the Inner Hebrides island of Islay. He developed an early interest in politics, joining the Liberal Democrat party at just 14. He went on to work as a hotel manager before studying law at Aberdeen University. He then became a procurator fiscal depute, working mostly in the criminal courts. He was elected to the UK parliament in 2001, replacing Jim Wallace as MP for Orkney and Shetland. Danny Alexander was Nick Clegg's chief of staff and the Liberal Democrats' campaign co-ordinator throughout the election. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe was also the former media chief of pro-euro campaign group Britain in Europe, which brought together leading Labour and Lib Dem voices with business groups. \r\r\n\r\r\nFirst elected to Parliament in 2005, he rose to prominence when Mr Clegg became party leader in 2007. \r\r\nHe was the author of the party's 2010 election manifesto, becoming the Scottish Secretary in David Cameron's initial coalition cabinet. \r\r\n \r\r\nMr Alexander was promoted to chief secretary - a crucial role overseeing spending cuts - to succeed David Laws after was forced to quit over his expenses after less than three weeks in the job. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe is one of four key ministers, known as \"the Quad\", who meet to discuss the direction of much of the coalition's policy. \r\r\n\r\r\nThe Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey MP won one of 11 seats for the Lib Dems in Scotland. Patrick McLoughlin was the Tory chief whip while the party was in opposition and carried on after the 2010 general election as the government chief whip. \r\r\nThe former miner is the MP for Derbyshire Dales. \r\r\nWhen the Conservatives were previously in power, he was a minister at the departments of transport, employment, trade and industry, and in the whips' office. In opposition, he became deputy chief whip in 1998.\r\r\n \r\r\nMr McLoughlin's mother was a factory worker and he worked as a farm labourer before following his father and grandfather into the pits. \r\r\n\r\r\nHis move to transport in the reshuffle has raised speculation the government is planning to alter its current stance opposing a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Elected MP for Clwyd West in 2005, Mr Jones was a middle-ranking minister in the Wales Office before being promoted to the cabinet.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe replaces Cheryl Gillan. Several Welsh Conservatives have expressed their delight that an MP with a Welsh constituency is now in the top job within the department. Ms Gillan's constituency is in England.\r\r\n \r\r\nA Welsh speaker, Mr Jones served as a member of the Welsh Assembly before going to Westminster.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe is a fan of Liverpool Football Club and a keen user of the social networking website Twitter. He is also chairman of the Chinese Conservative Group. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green, is steering through a range of welfare changes in the role he has held since the 2010 election. A former army officer, who saw active service in Northern Ireland, Mr Duncan Smith entered Parliament in 1992 and rapidly established himself as one of the Maastricht rebels that made life so difficult for then Tory leader John Major. He was seen as a rising star of the Eurosceptic right and, after a spell as shadow defence secretary under William Hague, was the surprise victor in the September 2001 leadership contest, beating better-known and more experienced, Europhile candidate Ken Clarke. He had a torrid time as the Tory leader, failing to land many real blows on then PM Tony Blair and enduring a relentless barrage of criticism from the press and, in some cases, his own MPs. In November 2002, he urged his party to \"unite or die\" in response to persistent whisperings of a challenge to his leadership, but a year later he was ousted after narrowly failing to win the backing of enough MPs in a vote of confidence. After losing the Tory leadership, he has successfully reinvented himself as a social reform champion who, with his centre-right think tank Centre for Social Justice, has played an influential role in developing Conservative policy on welfare and the \"broken society\". David Cameron reportedly tried to persuade Mr Duncan Smith to move to become Justice Secretary in his September 2012 reshuffle, but Mr Duncan Smith opted to stay with the welfare brief. Mr Cameron has previously said that Mr Clarke is a \"big figure\" with \"great experience\". He was the last chancellor to lead the UK out of recession - during the John Major government of the 1990s. His return to the Tory front bench in 2009 was seen as of a gamble for Mr Cameron, given that Mr Clarke - who held a host of ministerial jobs in the Thatcher and Major governments - had staunchly pro-European views. These views were widely seen to be the reason for his failure to win the three party leadership contests he entered - but Mr Cameron decided that Mr Clarke's experience was worth the risk of reopening party splits. Mr Clarke was president of the Union at Cambridge, became a QC in 1980 and after a succession of junior ministerial jobs he served as health, education and home secretaries before becoming chancellor from 1993 to 1997. He served as Justice Secretary from May 2010 until the move to a \"roving role\" as a \"wise head\" based in the cabinet office. Lord (Jonathan) Hill of Oareford became leader of the Lords at the age of 52 in January 2013 when Lord Strathclyde resigned.\r\r\n Although this is his first Cabinet post, he has wide experience, having been at the Conservative Research Department and then special advisor to Ken Clarke at Transport in the 1980s before becoming John Major's political secretary in No 10 from 1992. \r\r\nHe has also worked for public relations firm Bell Pottinger and in 1998 he became a founding director of PR and lobbying firm Quiller\r\r\nConsultants, where he remained until 2010 when he was made an education minister in the new coalition government.  Andrew Lansley, a former civil servant, became an active Conservative in the 1980s after a spell as private secretary to Norman Tebbit. In 1990 he became head of the Conservative Research Department and was one of the architects of the Tories' surprise 1992 election victory. However, he later faced criticism for his central role in the disastrous 2001 poll campaign. He returned to the shadow cabinet in 2003 under Michael Howard as shadow health secretary, the brief he continued to hold under David Cameron. Mr Cameron had long guaranteed Mr Lansley - who has played a key role in convincing people that the NHS is a high priority for the Conservatives - the role of health secretary in a government led by him. During his two years as health secretary, he steered through a large package of reforms of the NHS in England, despite facing opposition on a number of fronts. A Conservative activist from an early age - and the son of a former Tory MP - Dominic Grieve was elected to the Commons in 1997 as the MP for Beaconsfield in South Buckinghamshire. He is a barrister and was the shadow attorney general for four and a half years until June 2008, when he was appointed shadow home secretary.\r\r\n He filled the vacancy created when David Davis quit as an MP to fight a by-election on civil liberties and plans for a 42-day terror detention limit.\r\r\n Mr Grieve is an ex-member of the London Diocesan Synod with an interest in constitutional issues and an opposition to devolution - he is a past shadow Scottish affairs spokesman.\r\r\n Regarded as a skilled and assiduous Commons performer, he was the Tories' shadow justice secretary ahead of the election. The attorney general is not a full cabinet position under David Cameron.

{"article": "Every single-issue campaign group or minority starts with a dream. A dream to one day be in the position to achieve what it sets out to do. Many fall by the wayside, but the Scottish National Party - which formed 80 years ago this month - is one of the exceptions. It's taken a while to get there, but, despite the party's turbulent history, it will stage a referendum on Scottish independence on 18 September, after winning two historic terms in office. The story of the SNP is one of success and failure, highs and lows, rogues and visionaries - but, most of all, it's the story of a party which started life on the fringes and became a mainstream force. The modern case for Scottish home rule goes right back to its unification with England in 1707. The view that the Scots who put their names to the Act of Union had been bribed, famously spurred Robert Burns to later write: \"We are bought and sold for English gold. Such a parcel of rogues in a nation.\" Fast forward many years and those fighting for Scottish autonomy concluded that a pro-independence, election-fighting party was the way to go. And so on Saturday 7 April 1934 at Glasgow's St Andrew's Hall, the Scottish National Party - an amalgamation of the Scottish Party and the National Party of Scotland - was formally inaugurated. But for years the SNP struggled to make an impact, partly due to the ongoing debate between those who wanted to concentrate on outright independence - the fundamentalists - and those who wanted to achieve it through policies such as devolution - the gradualists. The young party's other problem was that, put simply, it just wasn't any good at fighting elections, because of its lack of funding, organisation and policies beyond independence. In its first test, the 1935 General Election, the SNP contested eight seats and won none. It was not until a decade later, at the Motherwell and Wishaw by-election, when the party finally got a break. When the contest was announced following the death of sitting Labour MP James Walker, the nationalists sent in one of their up-and-comers, Robert McIntyre. Standing largely on a platform of government failures in post-war reconstruction, the SNP took the seat with 50% of the vote, but lost it months later in the election. A lack of electoral impact forced the party to reorganise - a move which would help the SNP to an even more famous win. The 1967 Hamilton by-election should have been a breeze for Labour, but, as the party's vote collapsed, the SNP's Winnie Ewing romped home on 46%, declaring: \"Stop the world, Scotland wants to get on.\" The 1970s was the decade of boom and bust for the SNP. They failed to hang on in Hamilton, but 1970 brought the SNP its first UK election gain, in the Western Isles. That same decade also saw the beginnings of the party's \"It's Scotland's Oil\" strategy, which sought to demonstrate Scotland was seeing little direct benefit of the tax wealth brought by North Sea oil and gas. More success followed in 1973, when Margo MacDonald won the Glasgow Govan by-election and, the following year, an under-fire Tory government called an election, which it lost. The SNP gained six seats and retained the Western Isles, but lost Govan. With Labour in power as a minority government, the party had little choice but to call a second election in 1974 - but not before committing support for a Scottish Assembly. Even so, the SNP gained a further four seats, hitting its all time Westminster high of 11. The party's turn of fortunes was largely down to its visionary leader-of-the-day, Billy Wolfe. Despite the success, tensions began to develop between those in the SNP who were elected and those who were not. Then came 1979 - the year which provided two serious blows to the SNP. Margaret Thatcher's Tories swept to power, and a referendum for a devolved Scottish Assembly resulted in a \"No\" vote. To be more precise, a requirement that 40% of the total Scottish electorate had to vote \"Yes\" for the 1979 referendum to become law, was not met. With the constitutional issue off the table, the SNP came under a period of heavy fire from rivals, portrayed by Labour as the \"Tartan Tories\" and irrelevant \"Separatists\" by the Conservatives. With a post-election SNP slashed back to two MPs, the party needed a serious jump-start - but that jump-start dragged the party into a period which could have finished it off for good. The start of the 80s was a torrid time for the SNP when deep divisions gave rise to two notorious splinter groups. One was the ultra-nationalist organisation Siol Nan Gaidheal - branded \"proto fascists\" by the then SNP leader Gordon Wilson. The other was the Interim Committee for Political Discussion - more infamously known as the '79 Group, formed to sharpen the party's message and appeal to dissident Labour voters. But the party leadership was unimpressed, and when a leak of '79 Group minutes to the media raised the prospect of links with the Provisional Sinn Fein - despite claims the leaked version was inaccurate - Mr Wilson had had enough. His view that the party had to unite or die led to a ban on organised groups, but when the '79 Group refused to go quietly, several members were briefly expelled from the party. They included Scotland's future justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill, and one Alex Salmond. The 1987 election saw another bad SNP performance, emerging with only three seats. But, towards the end of the decade, were things looking up? Former Labour MP Jim Sillars, who defected to the SNP in the early 80s before becoming the architect of its independence in Europe policy, re-took Glasgow Govan for the SNP in a 1988 by-election - repeating the success of wife, Ms McDonald, more than a decade earlier. And a collapse in the Conservative vote in 1987 meant the constitutional issue was back. Now the party needed new blood at the top to take it forward into the next decade. Few people have done more to aid the success of the SNP than Alex Salmond. Despite previous form with the '79 Group, Mr Salmond had risen through the SNP ranks, becoming MP for Banff and Buchan in 1987. He did not have his work to seek on becoming leader in 1990. As well as having to deal with on-going internal issues over the party's independence policy - future minister Alex Neil had declared Scotland would be \"free by '93\" - there was an election to fight. In 1992, the SNP increased its vote, but the party was only able to retain the three seats it already had, and lost Govan. Mr Salmond moved to modernise the SNP to be more socially democratic and pro-European. For the SNP, the best it could manage in the first devolved election of 1999 was to become the main opposition to the Labour-Lib Dem coalition government. Then came Mr Salmond's surprising decision to quit as SNP leader, and as an MSP. His successor in 2000 was John Swinney, but, despite being among the party's brightest talent, the future Scottish finance secretary's four-year tenure was plagued by dissenters from within. The party dropped a seat in the 2001 UK election, and, despite a slick campaign in the 2003 Holyrood polls, the SNP once again ended up the opposition. Later that year, a little-known SNP activist called Bill Wilson challenged Mr Swinney for the leadership, accusing him of ducking responsibility for a \"plummeting\" SNP vote. Mr Swinney won a decisive victory, discarding his usual measured oratory during a hustings to declare his goal was \"to tell the Brits to get off\". If nominated I'll decline. If drafted I'll defer. And if elected I'll resign\u201d I changed my mind\u201d But he was left weakened, and, at Holyrood, SNP MSPs Bruce McFee and Adam Ingram declared they would not support Mr Swinney in a leadership ballot. Another, nationalist MSP, Campbell Martin, was flung out of the party after bosses found his criticism of the Swinney leadership damaged its interests in the run-up to the SNP's poor European election showing in 2004, where it failed to overtake Labour. Mr Swinney quit as leader, accepting responsibility for failing to sell the party's message - but warned SNP members over the damage caused by \"the loose and dangerous talk of the few\". When the leaderless party turned to Mr Salmond, he responded by borrowing from Union Army General William Sherman, who, on being asked to run for president following the American Civil War, declared: \"If nominated I'll decline. If drafted I'll defer. And if elected I'll resign.\" But ever full of surprises, Mr Salmond entered the leadership race, \"with a degree of surprise and humility, but with a renewed determination\". Essentially, as he put it himself: \"I changed my mind.\"  Nobody thought the 2007 Scottish election result could be so close. In the end, the SNP won the election by one seat, while Mr Salmond returned to Holyrood as MSP for Gordon. With the SNP's pro-independence stance ruling out a coalition with one of the other big parties, the party forged ahead as a minority government. The SNP government had promised to seek consensus on an issue-by-issue basis, but when the opposition parties thought ministers were being disingenuous, they converged to reject the Scottish budget in 2009. It was passed on the second attempt, but served as a reminder to the SNP the delicate position it was in. Other key manifesto commitments also ran into trouble - plans to replace council tax with local income tax were dropped due to lack of support, while ambitious plans to cut class sizes in the early primary school years ran into problems. Eventually, the bill on an independence referendum was ditched. Although the SNP's focus had become the Scottish government, it was keen not to lose sight of its status beyond the Holyrood bubble and, in 2009, won the largest share of the Scottish vote in the European election for the first time. Continuing its knack for winning safe Labour seats in by-elections, the SNP delivered a crushing blow to Labour, winning Glasgow East by overturning a majority of 13,507 to win by just a few hundred votes. The SNP went into the 2011 election campaign with Labour leading in the polls, but the party failed to repeat this success a few months later in the Glenrothes by-election and, later, in Glasgow North East. In a story that bore echoes of the past for the SNP, the 2010 UK election saw Labour regain Glasgow East. The 2011 Holyrood election was seen by some as Labour's to lose. In the event, that's exactly what happened. Despite polls predicting a Labour lead over the SNP of up to 15 points, the nationalists threw themselves into the campaign. They said their positive campaign, versus Labour's negativity, was what won it for them. The SNP's 2007 win was rightly described as a historic one - but, four years later, the party re-wrote the history books. The part-PR/part-constituency system at Holyrood was essentially designed to keep any one party (ie, the SNP) from winning an overall majority. Scotland's first majority government named the date for the referendum as 18 September 2014, and launched its prospectus for the future in a White Paper. But before all that, there was one big hurdle to clear. The SNP's opposition to all things nuclear has always been as fundamental as its support for independence itself. For many years it opposed membership of Nato, characterising the security alliance as one with a \"first-strike\" nuclear policy. SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said a fresh approach was needed ahead of the referendum - although part of the argument for Nato within the SNP rested on a pragmatic calculation that most voters favoured membership. And so, at the party's 2012 conference, members voted to end the decades-old opposition to Nato membership. But the decision didn't come without cost, and after a heated debate which invoked memories of SNP conferences past, two MSPs - Jean Urquhart and John Finnie - quit the party. But it seemed the party managed to move on from the episode, and today, the SNP, with its 25,000-strong membership, has truly come a long way since the fringes of 1934. But it now faces what could be a make-or-break challenge. Labour veteran George Robertson famously quipped devolution would \"kill nationalism stone dead\". But, with the SNP claiming rising support for a \"Yes\" vote, could the situation now be more akin to comments by another Labour stalwart, Tam Dalyell, who described devolution as \"a motorway to independence with no U-turns and no exits?\" It's a question which will not only define the future of Britain, but the future of the Scottish National Party.

{"article": "On a kibbutz outside Jerusalem Ed Miliband was greeted with a loud, warm Jewish embrace from 84-year-old Sara - his mother's cousin - who, like her, is a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust. It marked the end of a visit to Israel that has been as much about the personal as the political - a chance for the Labour leader to connect with his past as well as to talk about the future of the Middle East.  At the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial he was handed a book - the record of the lives and deaths at the hands of the Nazis of his relatives. He gulped and his wife Justine fought to hold back tears when they discovered that his grandfather had apparently died, not in Auschwitz - as they'd always thought - but in another concentration camp.  I want to be the post-Iraq prime minister and that means learning the lessons of Iraq\u201d I spoke to him about what the experience meant to him. \"It was quite an emotional visit for you to the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem. Did it bring you close to the losses your family suffered as a result of the Nazis?\"  \"It was sort of awful if I am honest. It is awful because you see the suffering. \"It would be awful for anyone because you see the suffering, but it was particularly, incredibly painful for me. \"They presented me at the end a document - which I have got here - about my family history and about my grandfather, who I never met who died in one of the camps. \"I feel such a long way away from that family history in a sense, because I have led such a secure upbringing from a very stable family, but both my parents were refugees. \"Large numbers of their relatives - including my mum's dad - lost his life in the Holocaust and so it is part of who I am, but a long way away, and then to come so close to it is incredibly painful.\" \"For those people who don't have those family roots, just try and capture what it means. You are not a religious man, it is not a religious thing that you are talking about, so what is it and how does it affect a potential prime minister?\"  \"There will be people who have lost relatives in very sad circumstances and so that is where it starts. \"But then it's about people whose lives have been broken, been dislocated, been sent hither all over the world. \"My dad [came] as a refugee to London in 1940, my mum [found] her way there after the Second World War. \"I think if I can say in a strange way that the only positive there is... having seen that broken world and broken families, I think it made them give me an upbringing which said 'don't waste a life, don't waste a single life'. \"So many lives have been wasted and destroyed, they never said that to me, so that is what is odd about it. \"They never said 'our family has a Holocaust history so you better work hard and do your homework', but they inculcated in me a sense of 'you have got to try and repair a broken world'. \"So that is - I won't say a positive - but that is some of the impact that it had on me.\" Just how broken the Middle East is, Mr Miliband saw on the top of a hill just above the Gaza Strip. He and his wife Justine were shown where the rockets are fired which rain down on this Israeli town of Sderot. They visited a playgroup which looks like many you would see in the UK, until you realise the kids are playing inside instead of outside as they would not be safe under the deep blue sky and are only so under a roof of reinforced concrete. On a visit to the West Bank on Saturday he will hear of Palestinian suffering.  Ed Miliband now talks often of his Jewish heritage (though not faith because he is an atheist) but he has never been a cheer leader for Israel. He's reluctant to call himself a Zionist. In his first speech to his party conference after being elected Labour leader in 2010, he urged Israel to recognise in deed as well as word the Palestinians' desire for statehood.  I asked him to spell out what sort of foreign policy a Prime Minister Miliband would pursue.  \"I want to be the post-Iraq prime minister and that means learning the lessons of Iraq. \"It does mean a Britain engaged with the rest of the world, and willing on occasion in the right circumstances to play its part militarily, of course to defend itself, but also for other purposes. \"But with clear tests - that military intervention can only be justified as a last resort and if there is a clear and compelling case for making that intervention, if there is international support and there is a proper prospect of success. \"If you look at the decisions I have made as leader of the opposition on Libya, where I supported intervention, or on Syria where I opposed it, I think I have been consistent with those principles and they are principles that I would apply in government.\" This visit is Mr Miliband's first major international trip apart from three visits to Afghanistan. He has not visited the White House, Beijing, Delhi or Berlin as leader of the opposition. \"I will make other visits,\" he told me - but I put it to him that this underlined a problem many people thought he had.   Media requires JavaScript to play. On Thursday Ed Miliband laid a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem  \"In little under a year's time you may be moving into 10 Downing Street. Do you accept that the British public don't yet see you as a prime minister, they can't yet envisage it? \"I think it is maybe always the case with leaders of the opposition. \"I have been doing this job for three-and-a-half years and I think in the past that people have maybe underestimated me. \"I am looking forward to the next 12 months. I think it is a big fight for the future of the country.\"  \"You think you have always been underestimated?\" I want big change in the country, people yearn for big change\u201d \"You always get your critics as leader of the opposition and I think people have tried to write us off before, but I am pretty confident and optimistic about the next election. \"I think there is a big fight for the future of Britain and about what kind of country we want to be like.\" Back home, Mr Miliband has been under pressure not to play it cautious in his approach to the next election and to be true to himself as the man who became Labour leader because he represented a rejection of his party's recent past.  \"There are some who accuse you of being simply too cautious as you are running for the election. I sense there is a kind of radical trapped in there, you want to see yourself as another Attlee or Thatcher, is that right?\" \"Look -  freeze energy prices, break up the banks, other things I have said, change the way our economy works, I don't think we are cautious. \"We are not going to win this election by being cautious - we are going to win it by being bold and by being clear about how we are going to change the country. \"It is absolutely the person that I am, that is why I ran for the leadership. \"I ran for the leadership in difficult circumstances, everybody knows. I ran against my brother. \"Why did I do it? Because I felt I had something to say about how we change the country. \"That's why I am in this, that's what I want to prove over the next 12 months.\"  \"An energy freeze may be a good idea or a bad idea, no one will write about it in 100 years' time. They will write about what Attlee did, they will write about what Thatcher did. Are you saying you may not want to lay it all out yet, that this is a radical offer of a transformation of the way that Britain is?\"  \"I think that I can substantially change the way our country works, because I think the central problem that we face - that countries around the world are going to face - in the coming years is: are you increasingly unequal, are you increasingly unjust, just working for a few people at the top of our society? \"That requires big change not small change. \"Whether it was on energy - where I was massively criticised for the boldness of it - or on the banks or on other areas, we are going to make that change happen so our country truly works for people.\"  \"But more than once I have seen you praise Margaret Thatcher. Not for her ideas or her policies but as a person who brought about change.\"  \"I know where you are trying to tempt me towards. \"I think these comparisons with other historical figures have their limitations. \"I am going to be my own person and I am going to change the country in my own way. \"But if you are asking me if we need big change not small change? The answer is yes.\"  \"You know what I am asking you. Are you going to be Labour's Margaret Thatcher?\"  \"Well no you don't make those comparisons. I want big change in the country, people yearn for big change.\" \"If a commentator called you Labour's Margaret Thatcher then you wouldn't much mind?\"  \"Well you can call me a radical.

{"article": "The thwack of cricket balls being hit and the sight of bowlers running in are part of an English summer. But, 100 years ago, a strike almost put an end to things. In 1907 an anonymous satirist made a joke which still resonates today. Writing in Mr Punch's Book of Sport, he (or she) stated that the \"British sphere of influence\" could be described in just three words: \"The cricket ball.\" A few years later, as the Great Powers were edging closer towards the slaughter and misery of World War One, this round, red symbol of summer - and Empire - came under threat. Angered by their low wages, the cricket ball makers of Kent went on strike in April 1914. Fears were raised that the season would be affected, even cancelled. Hand-crafted in the area for more than 150 years by that time, the balls of west Kent, home to firms such as Dukes and Alfred Reader, were seen as the best. The workers were proud. The Times, many of its readers fearful of a summer without watching the greats of the day, such as Jack Hobbs and Frank Woolley, in action, gave unusual prominence to such a small-scale dispute. \"Workers employed in the manufacture of cricket balls at Tonbridge have gone on strike to enforce their demand for an increase in wages,\" it reported. \"They want an advance of five shillings per dozen balls. The manufacturers admit that highly skilled workmen only earn 30 shillings a week, but state that retailers refuse to allow a sufficient margin to allow of the payment of a fair wage.\" In other words, cricket clubs wanted cheap balls, even if this came at the expense of a tradition. We were going nowhere, so we decided to call it a day\u201d Semi-rural Kent does not lend itself to the image of a hotbed of industrial trade unionism, but its workers were offended. Its ball manufacturers employed several hundred people at the time, many of whom complained of being treated like \"sweated labour\". \"The power of the union may be largely a thing of the past, and cricket ball manufacture, along with pretty much everything else in cricket, has now largely moved to the subcontinent\", says Matt Thacker, managing editor of   magazine.  \"But it's great to be reminded occasionally how deeply ingrained into the fabric of English life cricket was. \"It's hard to imagine these days an English season coming under threat from anything but the IPL (Indian Premier League).\" Of all sports, except perhaps baseball, cricket is the most reliant on its balls. Spin, swing, bounce - the varying state of the five-and-a-bit-ounce, stitched mass of cork and leather can massively affect the nature of play. Almost unthinkably now, Kent was the centre of an export trade, with enthusiasts in countries like Australia and India buying its wares. After a few weeks, the Amalgamated Society of Cricket Ball Makers came to an agreement with the manufacturers and the threat of an end to cricket was abated. A few months after the strike, World War One began and, within weeks, the first-class game came to a halt, but leagues, particularly in the north of England, continued and even thrived. Demand for balls continued. The cricket ball makers were not alone in being able to flex considerable muscle on a local scale. \"There were lots of small unions around at this time and they were often very effective,\" says Chris Burgess, curator of the  . \"For instance, you had the Cigarette Machine Operators' Society and the Sheffield Chauffeurs' Society. \"Cricket ball making was a skilled trade. The union would have had a big presence within the factory, looking after workers' rights and campaigning on issues like wages.\" After the 1918 Armistice, the Amalgamated Society of Cricket Ball Makers' books were found to be in a terrible state. Amid disquiet over this, a separate group, the Teston Independent Society of Cricket Ball Makers, was formed in 1919, as its title suggests, in the village of Teston, home of the Alfred Reader factory. The two unions' job got harder as the once-closed world of ball manufacture - rather like Britain's position as undoubted ruler of the Empire - came under challenge. In 1930 the ASCBM again became involved in a dispute over pay. The Australian government imposed an import tariff on cricket balls and manufacturers proposed cutting wages to cope with a loss in profits. The Australian press noted that firms in the Tonbridge area still supplied \"almost the entire Empire\". This had changed somewhat by the start of 1953, when another walkout occurred. The ball makers demanded a 9% increase in wages, but their employers would only offer 6%. The Times noted with concern in early April: \"There are only 90 craftsmen in the country and 45 have not made a ball since March 27.\" The workers soon returned. Over the years, English ball-making continued to decline, with much of the work being outsourced to lower-wage countries, such as India and Pakistan. Kent workers held another strike in 1962, calling for a sixpence-an-hour rise. After a month out, they accepted three-and-a-half pence. It was something of an industrial relations last hurrah. Only a few people are employed in ball-making in west Kent today. One of them, Matthew Waldock, says: \"I started in the 1980s and there were about 50 or 60 people working here. The Test Match balls we made were a work of art.\" Most of the work today involves selecting the English leather to be sent abroad and testing the quality of the balls when they arrive back from factories in India. In 2006, the Teston Independent Society of Cricket Ball Makers disbanded. It had just six members, making it probably the UK's smallest union. The Sheffield Shearers Society, with just nine members, folded a year later. Mr Waldock, general secretary of the Teston society at the time it was wound up, says: \"We were going nowhere, so we decided to call it a day.\" The photographs of dozens of craftsmen - in their cloth caps, shirts and collars, some perched on bicycles - defiantly on strike in 1914 show how things have changed.

{"article": "Politicians are often described, somewhat optimistically, as popular figures in Parliament, but in the case of Nigel Evans it is true. There was profound shock on all sides when the allegations of sexual offences against the then deputy Speaker first surfaced - and no shortage of MPs and peers willing to speak up for him. \"Nigel Evans is a hugely popular figure, a very gregarious figure,\" said Cardiff North MP Jonathan Evans, at the time. \"He is friends, really, with everybody. Very unusually in politics, he is warmly regarded by all parties.\" Among those offering character references, which were read out in court during his trial, were Labour MP Glenda Jackson, who described him as \"courteous, humorous and respectful of opinions\" and a \"hard-working backbencher\".  Labour's Ann Clwyd described him as \"naturally sociable\" and \"invaluable\" when dealing with foreign politicians as part of their roles on various committees.  Conservative MP Eleanor Laing, who won the election to replace him as deputy Speaker, said he was a \"well-respected, popular member of the House\", who was \"kind and thoughtful\" and \"known to be a gentle person\". Former MP Ann Widdecombe described him as a \"truthful, considerate and kind individual,\" adding that \"such qualities at Westminster are not universal\". There were similarly fulsome tributes from colleagues on Twitter when news of his acquittal broke. \"So pleased for my friend Nigel Evans today. A good man. Horrid experience to go through,\"   Pembrokeshire. \"Nigel Evans was an excellent Deputy Speaker and a lovely man. So pleased  he has been found not guilty,\"  . Mr Evans, 55, who resigned the Conservative whip and sat as an independent MP in the run-up to his trial, had earned his position in public life the hard way. The son of a Swansea newsagent, he liked to say it was \"God's little joke\" that he had been born a Conservative in south Wales, a Labour heartland. After joining the party at the age of 17, he got himself elected as a county councillor in his 20s and, by his early 30s had made two attempts to get into Parliament for Welsh seats. He finally achieved his ambition in 1992, in the Lancashire seat of Ribble Valley, after losing out to the Liberal Democrats at a by-election in the seat a year earlier.  He kept his links with Swansea, thanks to the family business, founded by his father. John Major appointed him the Conservative spokesman for Wales after the party's 1997 election defeat and, in 2001, he was made shadow Wales secretary by Iain Duncan Smith. He resigned from the post in 2003 when Michael Howard took up the leadership and decided not to include a Welsh affairs spokesman in his top team - a move criticised by Evans. At the time he said he had been offered the chance to carry on as Welsh affairs spokesman outside the cabinet, but had decided to return to the back benches instead. At the 2010 general election he retained his seat with a majority of more than 14,700 over his second-placed Labour rival. He abandoned any frontbench ambitions and decided instead to seek the non-partisan role of deputy Speaker, one of the most coveted in the Commons.  He was elected to serve as one of John Bercow's three deputies, who take it in turns to stand in for the Speaker, keeping MPs in order and selecting who gets to to speak in debates. It was the first time those roles had been chosen by a ballot of MPs and Mr Evans won more votes than the other two contenders. Mr Bercow described him as someone with a sense of humour, who knew the parliamentary rules and was \"quick on his feet\". He won further admiration from colleagues when, a few months after his election, he announced he was gay, saying he was tired of \"living a lie\". Launching a parliamentary group to help MPs be open about their sexuality, Mr Evans said he had been threatened with exposure by a former MP before deciding to come out as gay. \"With my background in south Wales, it was hard enough being a Tory, let alone being gay,\" he told the Mail on Sunday.  \"It wasn't so much 'the only gay in the village' as 'the only Tory in Swansea'.\" Mr Evans went to Dynevor School and to the city's university, where he graduated in politics, and was elected to the now-defunct West Glamorgan County Council in 1985. He became deputy leader of the council's Conservative group and remained a councillor until 1991, during which time he had already fought parliamentary elections in Swansea West and Pontypridd. The esteem in which Mr Evans was held by his colleagues at Westminster was never more evident than when his boss, John Bercow, allowed him to make a personal statement to the House, when he stood down as deputy Speaker to fight the allegations. His voice cracking with emotion, he told MPs: \"This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life, alongside the loss of my mother in 2009, and the loss of my brother earlier this year. \"Winston Churchill said, 'When you are going through hell, keep going.' Sage advice.  \"And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people who mean so much to me.\" ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26833993", "title": ["Profile: Nigel Evans"]},
{"article": "As the Olivier Awards-nominated Handbagged opens in the West End and Red Velvet storms New York, is this a golden period for London's Tricycle Theatre? Backstage at the Vaudeville Theatre on the Strand, Indhu Rubasingham is still catching her breath after a whirlwind week. The artistic director of the Tricycle Theatre is just back from New York, where her production of Red Velvet has opened to glowing reviews.  Now she is putting the finishing touches to her production of Moira Buffini's new play Handbagged, which sold out at the Tricycle last year and is now making a leap into the West End. If you personally judge yourself by awards then you're going to nowhere\u201d The play, which imagines the meetings between the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, is also a nominee at this Sunday's Olivier Awards, where it is up for outstanding achievement in affiliate theatre. Red Velvet was nominated in the same category last year. \"It's a great time for the Tricycle,\" says Rubasingham, who took over as artistic director in May 2012 after Nicolas Kent's 28 years at the helm.  \"If you personally judge yourself by awards then you're going to nowhere. Where these things help is on marketing, audiences, fundraising and profile.\"  The play's transition from the 200-seat theatre in Kilburn to the 700-seater Vaudeville has, she says, involved \"quite a bit of editing and tightening\".  Handbagged started life as a 20-minute piece in 2010. Plans to expand it were almost abandoned when it was announced that Peter Morgan's The Audience would open in the West End in 2013.  That play, starring Helen Mirren as the Queen, imagined the private meetings between the monarch and her prime ministers over her 60-year reign. \"In the end we thought it didn't matter,\" explains Rubasingham. \"They're actually very different stories.\"  As it turned out, Margaret Thatcher died three days before Buffini was due to start work on the full-length play. \"People thought we were really quick off the mark but it was always going to happen.\"  Handbagged's big theatrical idea is to double up the main roles.  Hence there are younger and older versions of the Queen (played by Lucy Robinson and Marion Bailey, respectively) and Margaret Thatcher (Fenella Woolgar and Stella Gonet).  Rubasingham says having both versions of each character on stage at the same time brought its own challenges for her as director. \"One may start a thought and the other one may finish it - it wasn't naturalism, it was pure theatre.  I felt like the play was stretching me, rather than me trying to make it work.\"  Both she and Buffini were \"Thatcher children\". Rubasingham recalls growing up in Mansfield, near Nottingham, during the miners' strikes.  \"When Moira was writing it we would talk a lot about our experiences. You realise how things that started at the time are the catalysts of what's happening now.  \"I wasn't a Thatcher fan growing up. Now it's not that I agree with her, but I've understood her a bit more, and I really admire that someone in that time, as a woman, had that kind of conviction politics, whether or not you agree with those politics.\" Rubasingham says the opening of Red Velvet in New York earlier this month was an \"emotional\" moment. She and playwright Lolita Chakrabarti first began talking about bringing the story to the stage eight years ago.   Starring Chakrabarti's husband Adrian Lester, Red Velvet tells the story of pioneering African-American actor Ira Aldridge, who caused a sensation in London in 1833 when he took over the role of Othello after famous actor Edmund Kean collapsed on stage. The play was Rubasingham's first project when she took over at the Tricycle. Almost two years on, it's now creating waves across the Atlantic.  \"It's been a huge journey, there were times when both of us thought this was never going to happen. Very rarely do those moments crystallise into something like this.\" She adds excitedly that Robert Redford had already been to see it. \"How has this happened after all that time when people were shutting the doors on it?\"  She thinks the script has film potential, and predicts the play will have a long life even after Lester has stepped down from the lead role. What kind of impact does a New York run and a West End transfer - Rubasingham's first from the Tricycle - have on the Kilburn theatre's finances? \"I don't know yet. The show in New York is not going to bring money to the Tricycle but it hasn't cost us money - but it raises the profile.  \"With Handbagged it's early days. If it sells and we more than break even, then money will come to the Tricycle.\"  Rubasingham sees investment as a key issue in theatre. \"The theatre community has got to communicate to society why it's important. The work we've done with Handbagged and Red Velvet has only come from Arts Council investment. I can take those risks.   \"In New York people say they don't see work like that because there isn't that investment. \"As a country we've got to put that investment in the arts because its our moral compass, it's our social conscience. It's our spiritual well-being as a society.  \"It's not just about luvvies having fun.\"  ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26968652", "title": ["Handbagged puts Queen and Margaret Thatcher back on stage"]},
{"article": "Maria Miller has resigned as culture secretary after being forced to repay \u00a35,800 in mortgage payments she over-claimed on her parliamentary expenses. These happened before the rules changed, but could it happen again with another MP? MPs have a divided work life, having to spend time both at Westminster and in their constituencies. This has long been recognised in the expenses system. Until 2010 all MPs - except those with seats in inner London - could claim up to \u00a324,000 a year towards buying, furnishing and renovating a second home.  This could include mortgage interest payments, meaning that increases in the values of properties (usually in London) were effectively being subsidised. After the 2009 expenses scandal broke, abuses of the system and apparent use of taxpayers' money to boost MPs' property portfolios and personal wealth led to demands for change. The rules were overhauled, starting after the 2010 general election for new MPs. Returning MPs were given a transitional period, lasting until 2012. Under the new system, MPs were allowed to claim a maximum of \u00a31,450 a month to rent - not buy - a second home. Mortgage assistance was thrown out. Also, the number of MPs allowed to claim any help with accommodation was reduced. All those who have constituencies within 20 miles - or 60 minutes - of central London are now banned from getting rent subsidies. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) was not given any retrospective powers to reclaim profits made on homes prior to 2010 for taxpayers. However, it was allowed to do so for the pre-2010 MPs who continued to claim mortgage interest payments from the 2010 election until 2012. IPSA ordered those who did so to have their second homes valued by a chartered surveyor at the beginning and the end of the period. If they had gone up in price, they had to repay up to 100% of the increase, depending on what portion of the mortgage interest had been funded by the taxpayer. There may still be MPs who overclaimed on their mortgages under the old system. House of Commons Leader Andrew Lansley has said as much. As time passes, the number affected is likely to dwindle, with the newer MPs unaffected by the previous system. But it is difficult to rule out another situation like Mrs Miller's. And mortgage expense claims will continue to be scrutinised. ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26952462", "title": ["What's changed with MPs' expenses?"]},

{"article": "Millions of people are voting in the European election and local council polls in England and Northern Ireland on Thursday. It is the final big test of public opinion before 2015's general election. All 73 UK seats in the European Parliament - the EU's only directly elected body - are up for grabs, along with 4,216 seats on local councils, nearly half of them in London.  Polling stations are open for voting between 07:00 and 22:00 BST. The last European elections took place in 2009. Voting will take place in the EU's other 27 member states over the next four days, with 751 MEPs in total being chosen. Thursday sees voting take place in the Netherlands. In England, a third of seats are being contested on dozens of district and unitary authorities and in the 36 Metropolitan Boroughs, including Tyne and Wear, Greater Manchester, South and West Yorkshire, Merseyside and the West Midlands. In London, every seat on all 32 London boroughs is up for election - the first time this has happened since the day of the 2010 general election.  Voters will also choose mayors in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford. In Northern Ireland, voters will elect 462 representatives to 11 so-called \"super districts\" following a reorganisation that took place in 2012, reducing the number of councils from 26 previously.  There are no local elections in either Scotland or Wales.  The weather forecast suggests that some people could have a very wet trip to the polling booths, with a Met Office weather warning covering Wales and southern England for heavy rain and possible localised flooding in areas hit by slow moving thundery downpours.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Home secretary Theresa May: \"Show the public you get it\" Theresa May has urged the Police Federation of England and Wales to reform, or she will enforce change. The home secretary made the demand as she told the federation its public funding would be withdrawn from August.  A motion for reform was passed at the federation's annual conference after Mrs May's speech.   Outgoing chairman Steve Williams told the BBC the federation would \"work hard\" to make sure the reforms were carried out. The organisation, which represents 126,000 rank and file officers, has faced accusations of bullying and a lack of transparency in its accounts.  Addressing the conference in Bournemouth, Mrs May said the organisation had to change \"from top to bottom\". BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Mrs May's fifth speech to the federation as home secretary was \"by far the most uncompromising\", leaving members shocked. It was met with silence from the audience. Government funding had already been reduced from \u00a3320,000 to \u00a3190,000 a year, the home secretary said, adding that the federation had built up \"vast reserves\" of cash. \"Show the public that you get it, that you want to take responsibility for the future of policing and you want to work with me to change policing for the better,\" said Mrs May.  She also announced the Home Office would use its powers to inspect the federation's accounts, and announced that she would be bringing forward proposals to make the organisation subject to the Freedom of Information Act. And she said officers would no longer automatically become members of the federation, instead having to opt in.   The money previously spent on the federation will instead be spent on a new scheme called Police First, aimed at attracting university graduates, she added.  The federation has been subject to allegations of widespread bullying and intimidation among its leadership, and was criticised for the way it handled the \"plebgate\" affair, which led to the resignation of former government chief whip Andrew Mitchell. In her  , Mrs May urged the federation to adopt changes recommended by the former top civil servant at the Home Office, Sir David Normington, who called for federation branches to disclose what money was held in secondary bank accounts. She said: \"Make no mistake. If you do not make significant progress towards the implementation of the Normington reforms, if the federation does not start to turn itself around, you must not be under the impression that the government will let things remain as they are. \"The federation was created by an act of Parliament and it can be reformed by an act of Parliament. \"If you do not change of your own accord, we will impose change on you.\"  Referring to \"plebgate\" and the findings of the review into the Hillsborough disaster, Mrs May said it was \"not enough to mouth platitudes about a few bad apples\" in the face of scandals.  Mr Williams, whose successor is set to be chosen on Friday, said of the emergency motion: \"I'm extremely proud of what's taken place today. We've made history today within the Police Federation.   \"And my colleagues have made the right decision in relation to embracing the reforms that are required.\"  He added that he was retiring as \"a very proud man and a very proud policeman\".  Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: \"What the home secretary has done is go beyond the Normington review and indeed beyond our recommendations.\"   Sir David congratulated the federation for \"having the courage of its convictions in order to vote through the entire package of reform that we proposed\". He said: \"The organisation now has a real opportunity to recreate the professional, trusted, and unified Police Federation which its members so badly want, and once again become the trusted voice of frontline officers. \"We expect the package of reform to take at least two years to implement - but this is a good beginning.  \"I hope it is the start of a process by which the Federation regains the trust of its members and becomes open and accountable whilst adopting the standards of behaviour which the public expects.\" However in response to Mrs May's speech, Ian Hanson, chairman of the federation's Greater Manchester branch, said it had been a \"vitriolic attack not only on the Police Federation but on every police officer in the country\". \"Much has been said about professionalism and standards of behaviour in recent times. Today Mrs May went too far and should apologise,\" he added.  ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27504422", "title": ["Theresa May urges Police Federation reform"]},
{"article": "Staff at polling stations have been told to stop people taking selfies - even though it is not against the law.  The Electoral Commission fears the craze for taking self-portraits on phones and posting them on social media threatens the secrecy of the ballot. Anyone who inadvertently reveals how someone else votes in Thursday's local and European elections could face a \u00a35,000 fine or six months in prison. Staff have been urged to put up \"no photography\" signs in polling stations. Some have also received training in what a selfie is - and what to do when they spot someone about to take one in or around a polling booth. \"We have told staff that if they see anyone taking a photograph they should ask the person to delete it but not try to wrestle the phone out of their hands,\" said an electoral services manager at an East of England local authority. \"It would depend on exactly what they were taking a photograph of. We have told them to take a note of the names and addresses of anyone doing it. But we would not necessarily call the police.\" She said staff would also make sure polling booths had open backs so they could see what was happening - and had been told to put up \"no photography\" signs outside and inside the polling station. Under Section 66 of the Representation of the People's Act it is a criminal offence to communicate information about the way someone has voted or is about to vote - or to communicate the unique identification number on the ballot paper.  The Electoral Commission fears people taking selfies could accidentally reveal details about how they, or someone else, has voted, potentially putting them in breach of the Act. But John Turner, chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said the law was not clear and needed to be updated for the 21st Century. \"There is not an Act of Parliament that says you should not take a selfie inside a polling station,\" he told BBC News.  \"This is essentially a piece of Victorian legislation and they didn't have mobile phones back then.\" Pressed on how he interpreted the law, he said taking a selfie and not showing it to anyone before polling stations closed would probably be within the law, but if they took a picture of the ballot paper \"and rushed outside and put it on Facebook\" they would be risking prosecution. But, he added, it would be up to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether to prosecute an individual. \"We are all up to our knees in the mire trying to work out what is against the law,\" said Mr Turner, but he added the best advice to anyone thinking of taking a polling booth selfie was that it was \"not worth the risk\". In its guidance to election administrators, the Electoral Commission said: \"The law relating to obtaining information in polling stations and disclosing such information is complex.  \"Given the risk that someone taking a photo inside a polling station may be in breach of the law, whether intentionally or not, our advice is that you should not allow photos to be taken inside polling stations.\" The Law Commission said it was reviewing all legislation on the way elections are conducted, including rules about secrecy and whether photography should be allowed, with a view to simplifying and updating them. It is due to publish proposals in the autumn, for consultation, ahead of a draft bill in 2017.

The team also found further evidence that Wallis emailed Ms Johnson a copy of an email that he had sent to his MP falsely claiming to have witnessed the incident at Downing Street.

{"article": "The UK's data privacy watchdog has said that it would focus on \"evidence of damage and distress to individuals\" when reviewing complaints about Google and others' search results. The Information Commissioner's Office's   is its first official response to last week's \"right to be forgotten\" EU ruling. The ICO will be responsible for resolving complaints in cases where a search firm refuses to remove links. It noted such action was months away. \"This judgment was only made last week, and the companies will need some time to work out how they're going to handle this,\" wrote David Smith, the body's director of data protection. \"We won't be ruling on any complaints until the search providers have had a reasonable time to put their systems in place and start considering requests.\" The Court of Justice of the European Union set a legal precedent on 13 May when it   had the right to have links to web pages about him removed from Google's results because the passage of time had made them \"irrelevant\". The Spanish man had complained that Google's links to an auction notice of his repossessed home  infringed his privacy. The takedown demand only applied to search results and not the web page containing the notice itself.  But the court added that others had a similar right to have search results deleted \"unless there are particular reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life\" that would justify keeping the links online. The court noted that if search engines refused to comply, it would be up to local authorities - such as the ICO - to force their hand. Google said the ruling was \"disappointing\" and that it needed time to \"analyse the implications\". But Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, has attacked the judgement, calling it \"wide-sweeping internet censorship\", adding that it would be difficult for search firms to determine what should be removed, The ICO acknowledged the \"right to be forgotten\" would be difficult to implement. \"It is important to keep the implications in proportion and recognise that there is no absolute right to have links removed,\" wrote Mr Smith. \"Our concern remains how this can be achieved in practice and how to set reasonable expectations for the public about how such a right can operate.\" He added that the ICO and other data protection authorities would need to issue guidance, and said that the organisation planned to discuss the matter with its European counterparts at the start of next month.

The   also said retail sales jumped by 1.3% between March and April beating analysts forecasts for a 0.5% rise. Food sales during the late Easter holiday made a significant contribution to the overall figure, the ONS said. They were 6.3% higher in April against a year earlier, and 3.6% up on March.  Non-food sales rose by 6.5% compared with a year earlier, but were down 0.4% on the month.  The annual rise in food sales was the biggest since January 2002, and were helped by a combination of better weather and sales promotions. Increases in the price of food were limited to 0.9% in April, compared with 1.8% a month earlier.   Quarterly retail sales have now grown for 14 months in a row, the ONS added. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, described the latest set of figures as \"mightily impressive\", adding \"this bodes very well for GDP growth in the second quarter\". He said: \"The fundamentals for consumers are currently improving overall, and they should continue to do so over the coming months as employment rises further and earnings growth likely trends higher than inflation, thereby lifting purchasing power. \"The strong housing market is also supportive to retail sales.\"  And Ian Geddes, UK head of retail at Deloitte, said: \"It is encouraging to finally see some strong figures in the food sector, as this remains a challenging market for the large grocers who are vigorously responding to consumers' changing retail habits and, are currently implementing significant structural reorganisation.  \"This is clearly a long race and the large grocers are repositioning themselves to win over customers in the new, more complex era of multichannel retailing.\" The retail figures come a day after official figures showed inflation increased to 1.8% in April, up from a four year low of 1.6% in March.  Meanwhile, the latest set of figures for average wage growth showed earnings grew by 1.7% in the year to March.

{"article": "The leader of Northern Ireland newest political party, Basil McCrea, wants an explanation from his deputy for calling NI21 \"crazy\" and \"dysfunctional\". John McCallister used the words in a   interview after his party's decision on Tuesday to switch designation from \"unionist\" to \"other\". It comes just two days before European and local government elections.  Mr McCrea said  it was disappointing that Mr McCallister made his disagreement \"in a very public way\". \"There is some discomfort in the way that was done,\" Mr McCrea told BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show on Wednesday. \"I do think there is an explanation that is owed to me - not just me but to other people - it was something of a surprise in the way that we heard things.\" If they thought the publicity would be a good thing just before elections, that, fundamentally, seems to have backfired.  They are moving into Alliance territory even though they say they are pro-union. Given that John McCallister represents half of the Assembly party, it is in a bit of a meltdown this morning.  They seem to have struggled with this. It is a fundamental decision to make. NI21 was set up by MLAs Mr McCrea and Mr McCallister, after they quit the Ulster Unionist Party in 2013. On Tuesday, the decision to change designation was announced, in response, the party said, to the message they had been receiving from people while canvassing.  But Mr McCallister told the News Letter the move put NI21 \"right into no man's land with the Alliance Party\". He said he had not been consulted in advance and had been called at short notice to a meeting on Tuesday. \"I was literally told to come down from my constituency to Belfast to do it, with no idea what it was about,\" he told the News Letter. He said that the meeting consisted of a \"15 or 20-minute discussion with everyone keen to get back out canvassing\". He voted against the change.  Media requires JavaScript to play. In an interview with the News Letter, John McCallister said the decision to change its designation warranted a wider discussion  However, Mr McCrea defended the move, saying labels from the past were inconsistent with NI21's message. \"It is not John and I - the executive takes the decision. The party has developed into a political movement which attracts huge numbers...The party is bigger than either individual,\" he said. \"It is not about individuals or what they think about, it is what the party collectively thinks.\" Mr McCrea said the NI21 executive would have a discussion with Mr McAllister about his comments. Messages posted on social media by party activists suggested a split in grassroots opinion about the move.  A post on the NI21 Youth Twitter account said \"the lack of respect shown towards our deputy leader was disgusting, and we fully support John McCallister\".  However, the tweet was later removed, and a later message said it was made by someone with access to the account but not approved by the Queen's University Belfast NI21 society.  \"While the message was perceived as aggressive, we do support its fundamental message,\" it added.

{"article": "This has to be one of the more ironic disclosures I have received in response to a Freedom of Information request. It is a document that was never used. It was prepared by the civil service in case the 1992 general election resulted in a Labour victory and Neil Kinnock became prime minister. This is the front page of a set of procedural guidelines that would have been distributed to his ministerial team under his name, if his government had ever been formed - it has the initials NK at the bottom. It is one of a number of official papers prepared for the possibility of a Kinnock premiership, which I have been   under freedom of information. The Cabinet Office turned down my request for them, the Information Commissioner   this refusal for the bulk of the material, but instructed the Cabinet Office to release this particular document.  Each incoming prime minister has issued procedural guidance to ministerial colleagues since Clement Attlee in 1945. A version was first publicly disclosed in 1996, by the man who beat Lord Kinnock, Sir John Major. It is now routinely published today as the  . But the intriguing feature of the Kinnock version is point two, where the draft says he will publish this guidance note \"in accordance with our policy on freedom of information\".  In 1992 Labour   to introduce a Freedom of Information Act, and the officials who drafted this document were clearly anticipating that policy. Given that the Cabinet Office was preparing to release this paper in 1992 in line with a predicted Freedom of Information law, it seems puzzling and ironic that - despite a real FOI law now existing - it refused to disclose it over 20 years later until ordered to do so by the Information Commissioner. As for the other documents prepared for Neil Kinnock in 1992, the BBC is appealing the case to the Information Rights Tribunal. The government   that releasing them would encourage officials to write future briefings that are \"excessively detailed\" and \"verbose\".

{"article": "  \n\t\t \n\t Conservative David Cameron was virtually unknown outside Westminster when he was elected Tory leader in December 2005 at the age of 39. \r\r\nThe Old Etonian had dazzled that year's party conference with his youthful dynamism and charisma, reportedly telling journalists he was the \"heir to Blair\". He has sought to match the former PM by putting the Conservatives at the centre ground of British politics. After the 2010 election he led his party into coalition with the Lib Dems, making tackling the UK economy's deficit its priority. He has faced criticism from some on the right of the party but Mr Cameron has insisted the coalition will see through its full five-year term. Before becoming leader, he was the Conservatives' campaign co-ordinator at the 2005 general election and shadow education secretary. He was special adviser to Home Secretary Michael Howard and Chancellor Norman Lamont in the 1990s before spending seven years as a public relations executive with commercial broadcaster Carlton. In just five years, Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, a contemporary of Mr Cameron, went from political obscurity to the absolute front line of British politics. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter becoming MP for Sheffield Hallam at the 2005 election, he was promoted to Europe spokesman, before moving on to the home affairs role. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWhen Sir Menzies Campbell resigned as leader in 2007, he entered the race to succeed him, in the end narrowly beating Chris Huhne. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe really came to prominence during the televised debates ahead of the general election, being judged in polls to have been the big winner of the first one. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, this appeared to do little to help the Lib Dems when they actually lost seats on 6 May. The party, though, retained enough MPs to become the vital players in the hung parliament. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter taking his party into coalition with the Conservatives - and U-turning on a previous pledge to reject university tuition fees - Mr Clegg saw his personal poll ratings slump, but he has pointed to areas where Lib Dem policies have come into force on taxation and consitutional issues. \r\r\n\r\r\nLike David Cameron, he has insisted the coalition is working in the national interest and will continue for the full parliament. One of David Cameron's closest friends and Conservative allies, George Osborne rose rapidly after becoming MP for Tatton in 2001. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMichael Howard promoted him from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury to shadow chancellor in May 2005, at the age of 34. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Osborne took a key role in the election campaign and even before Mr Cameron became leader the two were being likened to Labour's Blair/Brown duo. The two have emulated them by becoming prime minister and chancellor, but have avoided the spats. \r\r\n\r\r\nSome prominent Conservatives have urged Mr Osborne to do more to promote economic growth. \r\r\n\r\r\nBefore entering Parliament, he was a special adviser in the agriculture department when the Tories were in government and later served as political secretary to William Hague.\r\r\n Theresa May is the second woman to hold the post of Home Secretary. \r\r\n\r\r\nShe was the first woman to become Conservative Party chairman, under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith. \r\r\n\r\r\nShe then took up the culture and family portfolios before being made shadow Commons leader by David Cameron. \r\r\nShe has been a keen advocate of positive action to recruit more women Tories to winnable seats and was a key architect of the \"A list\" of preferred candidates. \r\r\n\r\r\nA passionate moderniser, she famously ruffled feathers when she told Tory activists they were seen as members of the \"nasty party\". \r\r\nIn her role as home secretary, she has overseen widespread changes to the immigration system. \r\r\n\r\r\nMrs May was the shadow work and pensions minister ahead of the election. Since he returned to frontline politics in 2005, Conservative William Hague has become a key adviser to David Cameron, and was seen as de facto deputy party leader. \r\r\nThe foreign secretary has plenty of experience to call upon, having been Tory leader himself from 1997 to 2001 and shadow foreign secretary until the election. \r\r\n\r\r\nA witty and engaging Commons performer who is popular with grassroots Tory members, Mr Hague entered Parliament in 1989 having been special adviser to Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe. He was soon promoted to be a social security minister and in 1995 entered the cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales. \r\r\n\r\r\nIn addition to his duties as shadow foreign secretary, Mr Cameron put Mr Hague in charge of rebuilding the party in the North of England, as chairman of its Northern Board. Vince Cable has had a long journey to reach the front rank of politics, having been a Labour and then an SDP supporter before its merger with the Liberals to become the Liberal Democrats. \r\r\n\r\r\nAn economist by profession, he entered Parliament as MP for Twickenham in 1997 and has gradually built up his powerbase among the Lib Dems. \r\r\nAs the party's deputy leader and Treasury spokesman he saw his stock rising during the credit crunch because of his earlier warnings. \r\r\n\r\r\nWhen he stood in as temporary leader after the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell, he memorably described Gordon Brown as going from \"Stalin to Mr Bean\". \r\r\n\r\r\nHas had a colourful time in government, notably when he was recorded by under cover reporters saying he was at war with Rupert Murdoch's News International. He has been mentioned as a possible future leader of his party. \r\r\n\tSir George Young was replaced as leader of the Commons by Andrew Lansley in the September 2012 reshuffle, but was recalled and given the Chief Whip post a few weeks later following the resignation of Andrew Mitchell.\r\r\n \r\r\n\tSir George, 71 at the time of his return to the cabinet, is one of the most experienced members of the government and has served a number of roles in Conservative administrations since the 1970s. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tHe was elected as MP for Acton in 1974 and became a junior minister in the Thatcher government in 1979. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tIn 1994 he became Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and was promoted a year later to transport secretary. Switching seats to North West Hampshire in 1997, he was given the shadow Commons leader's job in the Tory opposition the same year.\r\r\n \r\r\n\tFrom 2001-09 he served as chairman of the Standards and Priveleges committee, which required him to ajudicate allegations of MPs misconduct. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tSir George was educated at Christ Church Oxford and is married with two sons and two daughters. He is a keen cyclist and received the nickname \"the bicycling baronet\" after appearing in a British Rail advert promoting the transport of bikes on trains.\r\n\t\t\t Eric Pickles was first elected to the Commons in 1992, representing an Essex seat far from his Yorkshire roots. \r\r\n \r\r\nHe has extensive local government experience, having led Bradford District Council for three years up to 1991.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe has also served in a variety of shadow ministerial roles, including transport, local government and social security spokesman, earning a reputation for loyalty and good humour.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe boosted his reputation and profile in the party by masterminding its landmark victory over Labour in the Crewe and Nantwich by-election and was appointed party chairman in 2009.\r\r\n \r\r\nAnd he became a regular and confident media performer in the months leading up to the 2010 general election. Mr Shapps, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, since 2001, has made a name for himself as a keen and frequent media performer.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn his twenties he started a printing company.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn 2005, Mr Shapps became a deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, experience which will be useful in his new job as chairman.\r\r\n \r\r\nUntil the reshuffle, he served as housing minister, a role without full cabinet status but one which allowed him to attend meetings. A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, Sajiv Javid is the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He became an MP in 2010 and is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. He was a City banker and became a Treasury minister in 2013. Philip Hammond has built up a reputation as an articulate and effective Commons performer since being elected MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in 1997. \r\r\n\r\r\nA former director of companies supplying medical equipment, he was initially a member of the Conservative shadow health team before going on to serve as trade and industry spokesman. He also backed Michael Portillo's 2001 leadership bid. \r\r\n\r\r\nIn summer 2002, he went to shadow the now defunct Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government department before being made shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, at the age of 51, in the July 2007 reshuffle. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe became Transport Secretary after David Cameron's coalition took power after the 2010 election, building on his reputation there as an effective performer before being shifted into the defence brief after the resignation of Liam Fox from the job in October 2011. Tory Michael Gove was seen as one of the brightest talents in the 2005 intake. The former Times journalist is a key member of David Cameron's inner circle who helps write many of his speeches. \r\r\n\r\r\nAs the Tories' housing spokesman, Mr Gove made a name for himself as an effective Commons performer in attacks on the government's home information packs. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe was drafted into the shadow cabinet as children, schools and families spokesman, at the age of 39 when his leader split the education brief in two to reflect Gordon Brown's Whitehall changes. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Gove headed the Policy Exchange think tank for three years before landing the safe seat of Surrey Heath. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe had previously said he was prepared to give up a post in the new cabinet to ensure the deal with the Lib Dems went ahead, but he stuck with the education brief in government bringing forward a series of radical changes such as free schools and exam reforms. Liberal Democrat Ed Davey was appointed Energy and Climate Change Secretary on 3 February 2012 following the resignation of Chris Huhne.  \r\r\nMr Davey was elected MP for the newly created seat of Kingston in 1997 and has held a series of frontbench roles. Popular within the party, he was seen as an outside contender to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell when he stood down in 2007. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter serving as the Liberal Democrat spokesman for foreign affairs prior to the 2010 election, he was appointed business minister responsible for the Post Office, Royal Mail and employment relations in the coalition government.  Conservative MP Owen Paterson covered the Northern Ireland portfolio in opposition and in government before being moved to environment in David Cameron's reshuffle. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe entered the shadow cabinet for the first time, at the age of 50, in David Cameron's July 2007 reshuffle. \r\r\nA former managing director of the British Leather company, he entered Parliament as MP for Shropshire North in 1997, concentrating on rural issues as a junior agriculture spokesman and chairman of the Conservative Rural Action Group. \r\r\n\r\r\nA Eurosceptic and member of the right wing Cornerstone Group, which campaigns for traditional Tory values, he helped Iain Duncan Smith during his 2001 leadership bid and was briefly parliamentary private secretary to Ann Widdecombe. He has also served in the Opposition whips office. Jeremy Hunt was moved to the health brief after the overseeing the smooth running of the 2012 London Olympics. \r\r\nThe MP for South West Surrey since 2005, he became the Conservatives' culture spokesman in 2007. He was previously the party's spokesman on disabilities and welfare reform. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Hunt, a fluent Japanese speaker, founded a company called Hotcourses, offering guides to help students find the right course before entering university. \r\r\n\r\r\nAs culture secretary he had a chequered time, coming under pressure over his dealings with Rupert Murdoch's News International takeover bid. Justine Greening was promoted to the cabinet in October 2011 at the age of 42. \r\r\n\r\r\nMiss Greening, the MP for Putney since 2005, became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.\r\r\n \r\r\nBorn and educated in Yorkshire, Miss Greening studied economics at Southampton University, before getting an MBA from London Business School and worked as a finance manager at British Gas owner Centrica before joining the Commons.\r\r\n \r\r\nHer move from transport was widely perceived to be a result of her vocal opposition to the idea of a third runway being built at Heathrow. Chris Grayling's elevation to the post of Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary represented something of a comeback. \r\r\nPrior to the 2010 general election he had been shadow home secretary but, when the coalition was formed, he was made employment minister, rather than given a cabinet role. \r\r\n\r\r\nSeen as being on the right of the party, Mr Grayling's appointment to the justice role will be intended to reassure some Conservatives who were unhappy at predecessor Ken Clarke's prison reforms, claiming they were too lenient on criminals. \r\r\n\r\r\nEducated at Cambridge University, he is a former BBC News producer and the author of books on subjects including the Bridgewater Canal and Anglo-American relations. A former barrister, Ms Villiers was elected MP for Chipping Barnet in 2005. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power. \r\r\n \r\r\nA self-described Eurosceptic, she takes over from Owen Paterson in the post of Northern Ireland Secretary. Mr Carmichael has been appointed Scottish Secretary in the government's latest reshuffle. He replaces Michael Moore - a leading figure in the No campaign for the Scottish independence referendum. Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, has been the Lib Dems' chief whip and a government deputy chief whip since the formation of the coalition. He was previously the party's Scottish spokesman. Born in 1965, Mr Carmichael had a traditional upbringing on a hill farm on the Inner Hebrides island of Islay. He developed an early interest in politics, joining the Liberal Democrat party at just 14. He went on to work as a hotel manager before studying law at Aberdeen University. He then became a procurator fiscal depute, working mostly in the criminal courts. He was elected to the UK parliament in 2001, replacing Jim Wallace as MP for Orkney and Shetland. Danny Alexander was Nick Clegg's chief of staff and the Liberal Democrats' campaign co-ordinator throughout the election. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe was also the former media chief of pro-euro campaign group Britain in Europe, which brought together leading Labour and Lib Dem voices with business groups. \r\r\n\r\r\nFirst elected to Parliament in 2005, he rose to prominence when Mr Clegg became party leader in 2007. \r\r\nHe was the author of the party's 2010 election manifesto, becoming the Scottish Secretary in David Cameron's initial coalition cabinet. \r\r\n \r\r\nMr Alexander was promoted to chief secretary - a crucial role overseeing spending cuts - to succeed David Laws after was forced to quit over his expenses after less than three weeks in the job. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe is one of four key ministers, known as \"the Quad\", who meet to discuss the direction of much of the coalition's policy. \r\r\n\r\r\nThe Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey MP won one of 11 seats for the Lib Dems in Scotland. Patrick McLoughlin was the Tory chief whip while the party was in opposition and carried on after the 2010 general election as the government chief whip. \r\r\nThe former miner is the MP for Derbyshire Dales. \r\r\nWhen the Conservatives were previously in power, he was a minister at the departments of transport, employment, trade and industry, and in the whips' office. In opposition, he became deputy chief whip in 1998.\r\r\n \r\r\nMr McLoughlin's mother was a factory worker and he worked as a farm labourer before following his father and grandfather into the pits. \r\r\n\r\r\nHis move to transport in the reshuffle has raised speculation the government is planning to alter its current stance opposing a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Elected MP for Clwyd West in 2005, Mr Jones was a middle-ranking minister in the Wales Office before being promoted to the cabinet.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe replaces Cheryl Gillan. Several Welsh Conservatives have expressed their delight that an MP with a Welsh constituency is now in the top job within the department. Ms Gillan's constituency is in England.\r\r\n \r\r\nA Welsh speaker, Mr Jones served as a member of the Welsh Assembly before going to Westminster.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe is a fan of Liverpool Football Club and a keen user of the social networking website Twitter. He is also chairman of the Chinese Conservative Group. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green, is steering through a range of welfare changes in the role he has held since the 2010 election. A former army officer, who saw active service in Northern Ireland, Mr Duncan Smith entered Parliament in 1992 and rapidly established himself as one of the Maastricht rebels that made life so difficult for then Tory leader John Major. He was seen as a rising star of the Eurosceptic right and, after a spell as shadow defence secretary under William Hague, was the surprise victor in the September 2001 leadership contest, beating better-known and more experienced, Europhile candidate Ken Clarke. He had a torrid time as the Tory leader, failing to land many real blows on then PM Tony Blair and enduring a relentless barrage of criticism from the press and, in some cases, his own MPs. In November 2002, he urged his party to \"unite or die\" in response to persistent whisperings of a challenge to his leadership, but a year later he was ousted after narrowly failing to win the backing of enough MPs in a vote of confidence. After losing the Tory leadership, he has successfully reinvented himself as a social reform champion who, with his centre-right think tank Centre for Social Justice, has played an influential role in developing Conservative policy on welfare and the \"broken society\". David Cameron reportedly tried to persuade Mr Duncan Smith to move to become Justice Secretary in his September 2012 reshuffle, but Mr Duncan Smith opted to stay with the welfare brief. Mr Cameron has previously said that Mr Clarke is a \"big figure\" with \"great experience\". He was the last chancellor to lead the UK out of recession - during the John Major government of the 1990s. His return to the Tory front bench in 2009 was seen as of a gamble for Mr Cameron, given that Mr Clarke - who held a host of ministerial jobs in the Thatcher and Major governments - had staunchly pro-European views. These views were widely seen to be the reason for his failure to win the three party leadership contests he entered - but Mr Cameron decided that Mr Clarke's experience was worth the risk of reopening party splits. Mr Clarke was president of the Union at Cambridge, became a QC in 1980 and after a succession of junior ministerial jobs he served as health, education and home secretaries before becoming chancellor from 1993 to 1997. He served as Justice Secretary from May 2010 until the move to a \"roving role\" as a \"wise head\" based in the cabinet office. Lord (Jonathan) Hill of Oareford became leader of the Lords at the age of 52 in January 2013 when Lord Strathclyde resigned.\r\r\n Although this is his first Cabinet post, he has wide experience, having been at the Conservative Research Department and then special advisor to Ken Clarke at Transport in the 1980s before becoming John Major's political secretary in No 10 from 1992. \r\r\nHe has also worked for public relations firm Bell Pottinger and in 1998 he became a founding director of PR and lobbying firm Quiller\r\r\nConsultants, where he remained until 2010 when he was made an education minister in the new coalition government.  Andrew Lansley, a former civil servant, became an active Conservative in the 1980s after a spell as private secretary to Norman Tebbit. In 1990 he became head of the Conservative Research Department and was one of the architects of the Tories' surprise 1992 election victory. However, he later faced criticism for his central role in the disastrous 2001 poll campaign. He returned to the shadow cabinet in 2003 under Michael Howard as shadow health secretary, the brief he continued to hold under David Cameron. Mr Cameron had long guaranteed Mr Lansley - who has played a key role in convincing people that the NHS is a high priority for the Conservatives - the role of health secretary in a government led by him. During his two years as health secretary, he steered through a large package of reforms of the NHS in England, despite facing opposition on a number of fronts. A Conservative activist from an early age - and the son of a former Tory MP - Dominic Grieve was elected to the Commons in 1997 as the MP for Beaconsfield in South Buckinghamshire. He is a barrister and was the shadow attorney general for four and a half years until June 2008, when he was appointed shadow home secretary.\r\r\n He filled the vacancy created when David Davis quit as an MP to fight a by-election on civil liberties and plans for a 42-day terror detention limit.\r\r\n Mr Grieve is an ex-member of the London Diocesan Synod with an interest in constitutional issues and an opposition to devolution - he is a past shadow Scottish affairs spokesman.\r\r\n Regarded as a skilled and assiduous Commons performer, he was the Tories' shadow justice secretary ahead of the election. The attorney general is not a full cabinet position under David Cameron.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. In full: Prime Minister David Cameron's speech on Europe David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech ( ) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to \"bring back\" powers to Westminster from Brussels.  For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are   from the speech. The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be \"brought back\" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: \"We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK.\" The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.  David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: \"Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest?  I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market.\" Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a \"chilling effect\" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it \"game, set and match\" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.  The BBC has compiled  . Here is a round-up of  . The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off \"leaving gracefully\". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said \"cherry picking is not an option\". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said:  \"We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'.\" Read  . A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU.  The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said \"closer union of the eurozone is not for us\" but Mr Cameron \"rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU\".

{"article": "The then   beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his \"Red Ed\" tag by talking about the \"squeezed middle\" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on \"refounding\" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.  The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls,  , became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.  Popular throughout the party, the then   got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.  The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll.  , he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.  Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury.  in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011.  Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the  . A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader.

Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet.   was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief.

{"article": "The Nottinghamshire market town of Newark is no stranger to hand-to-hand political battles. King John died in its walled castle. Was it a political killing? In the Civil War, the Royalists came a cropper at the hands of the parliamentarians. Now the town is about to face another siege: this time from teams of party canvassers, election campaigners and political journalists.  And then there's the list of candidates wanting to become the next MP for Newark. The by-election was caused by the   Patrick Mercer, over a cash-for-parliamentary-questions scandal. The by-election is on 5 June, but the Conservatives have hit the ground running.   The local party selected a new candidate last November, the moment Patrick Mercer resigned the Tory whip. He remained in the Commons as an independent MP.   The party's pinning its hopes on Robert Jenrick, until recently a director with Christie auctioneers. But could Newark's 16,000 Conservative majority end up going, going, gone? The national attention of a parliamentary by-election and the scrutiny of the main candidates involved can be a mixed blessing. \"There will be national interest,\" Mr Jenrick told me. \"What most people in the town want is a long-term constituency MP, who'll be a real champion for the area.  \"Also, someone who's going to live here with the family, make a life here and follow in the tradition of other Nottinghamshire MPs, like Patrick and Ken Clarke in Rushcliffe.\" He highlights local issues such as improving Newark's schools and the town's hospital. But in most by-elections, the outcome is viewed as a verdict on the performance of the party in government.  For the Conservatives, there's also the UKIP factor.   in this election but UKIP's candidate Roger Helmer will cause some nerves. He's an East Midlands MEP and a former Conservative, who defected two years ago to UKIP.  He had rowed with the Tory leadership over his successor as MEP. The veteran MEP has a track record for being outspoken, and past remarks have been seized on by critics as being homophobic and soft on date rape. I asked him if he regretting those remarks. \"I'm regretting the storm of media attention on those issues. I want to concentrate on issues to do with this by-election and what it means for Newark. \"There's also the fact of having the first UKIP MP in Westminster saying the things that so many people in Britain and Newark want to hear,\" he added. Labour's candidate Michael Payne hopes to shred that Conservative majority, but is UKIP a help or hindrance?  \"UKIP aren't the answer here in Newark,\" he said. \"UKIP wants to privatise our NHS. They want to water down drink-driving laws. What I'm concentrating on is talking to people who want a real alternative.  \"And the only way they can send that message to David Cameron and the Liberal Democrats who support him, is to vote Labour in the by-election.\"  The Liberal Democrats polled 20% in the last general election. Their candidate is David Watts, a Nottingham-based lawyer and a senior councillor in Broxtowe, where the Nottingham suburban council is a Labour/Lib-Dem coalition. \"I recognise we are no longer the party of protest because we are a party of government, \" said Mr Watts. \"We need to show the real benefits of voting Liberal Democrat and the difference we are making to this country.\" And no by-election is complete without the novelty value of a fringe independent. Buspass Elvis - aka Dave Bishop - is no stranger to by-elections.  He hopes to better the 67 votes he received in a council by-election in Nottingham last March. The result made national headlines:  . Even he admits, that's an unlikely prospect in Newark.

{"article": "A:  It's hoped that by synchronising them with the European Elections, money will be saved and turnouts raised. A: It's a Thursday!  While there's nothing sacrosanct about Thursdays, it is a convention in this country that it is when elections are held. One theory is that it was originally the day generally considered least disruptive to  government and council business. The composition of the elected body would usually be known by the Friday, leaving the weekend for the formation of a new administration in time for the start of the  working week. In this case, it's the Thursday closest to the Sunday when voters go to the polls in the rest of Europe: the results will not be declared until after polls have closed across the EU on Sunday night: it would never do for the West Midlands results to skew the outcome in Westphalia, would it??!!     In addition to the vote every elector has in the European elections, there will be local elections in all seven giant metropolitan authorities in the West Midlands conurbation from Coventry to Wolverhampton. Then there are the 11 county districts where most will elect one-third of their councillors. But in Nuneaton and Bedworth and in Cheltenham half the seats are to be contested. With nearly 350 seats in play in 18 councils, this is a very big electoral deal in its own right. But that will not stop us from scouring the results for pointers towards the next general election.  This is inevitable with less than twelve months to go, especially here in a region where nearly 30 of our famous 'marginal' seats feature in the rival target lists for the two biggest parties: with both the Conservatives and Labour short of a Parliamentary majority, each needs gains from the other. And by an uncanny quirk of fate, two-thirds of those 18 councils holding elections also feature in the roll call of Parliamentary marginals. 1. BIRMINGHAM At the UK's largest local authority, Labour will retain control. But voting will be keenly watched to see if Labour can gain ground, in Edgbaston for example, which is always a key Parliamentary marginal. The Conservatives will hope to keep what they hold in Northfield and Bournville which will be general election target territory for them next May. The Liberal Democrats will be battling to hold off Labour in key wards including those in the Lib Dem's Parliamentary constituency of Yardley.  2. CANNOCK CHASE Labour currently hold 24 of the 41 seats and will be defending just 5 of the 13 wards going to the polls this time so they will be hoping to increase their majority. The council area exactly matches the Parliamentary constituency which Aidan Burley captured so sensationally for the  Conservatives with a 14% swing. He announced in February that he would stand down at the next election following his involvement in a Nazi-themed stag party. This is one of the areas where UKIP polled strongly in last year's county council elections. 3. CHELTENHAM The Regency spa town has had a Liberal Democrat MP for more than twenty years. It is also the only Liberal Democrat-controlled authority in our part of the country. Their ruling group's obituary has been written many times before and it does have twice as many seats as the Conservatives. But with Nick Clegg's party languishing in the polls this will be an important test of the Lib Dems' ability to retain traditional core support.  4. COVENTRY Labour will retain or even strengthen its comfortable majority. With no Liberal Democrats in the current council, attention will focus on UKIP's claims it is gaining support at Labour's expense and not just that of the Conservatives. 5. DUDLEY Having gained overall control in 2012 Labour defend 12 of its 42 seats this time, so it will hope to strengthen its position especially against a Conservative group afflicted by internal disputes and defections, especially to UKIP. Also on the council is Will Duckworth, the national Deputy Leader of the Green Party. Voting patterns will be closely scrutinised for pointers to the two Parliamentary marginals: Dudley North has a wafer-thin Labour majority and Dudley South is also a weather vane seat currently held by the Conservatives. 6. GLOUCESTER The Conservatives have 18 seats and Labour and the Liberal Democrats nine each. So the Conservatives look set to remain the largest party, but voting patterns will be closely scrutinised not just for UKIP's showing but also in terms of the city's barometer Parliamentary constituency. The Conservatives gained it from Labour at the last general election with a majority of under 2,500. 7. NEWCASTLE-UNDER-LYME Having deposed the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition last year, Labour have a majority of four. Most of its seats happen to be among its safest. This is one of the places to look at for evidence of the UKIP challenge: the council leader here failed in his bid for a county council seat last year, losing to an incumbent UKIP councillor by just two votes.  Labour have a Parliamentary majority here of just 1500. 8. NUNEATON AND BEDWORTH Labour won a majority last time and now have three times as many councillors as the Conservatives. Nuneaton's constituency has a Conservative majority of just over 2,000. 9. REDDITCH A see-saw council in a marginal Parliamentary constituency. Labour took back control from the Conservatives two years ago and currently hold 15 seats to the Conservatives' 13 with one  independent. The Parliamentary seat is held by the Conservatives with the 6,000 it achieved in defeating the former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith at the last general election. 10. RUGBY The Conservatives go into this election holding 25 seats to Labour's 10, the Liberal Democrats' 6 plus one independent. The Conservatives also won by-elections in May and November last year and have a Parliamentary majority of 6,000. 11. SANDWELL Labour enjoyed a clean sweep here in the last elections two years ago although three former councillors now sit as independents. One of only two remaining Conservatives is up for re-election.  12. SOLIHULL An intriguing contest: the Conservatives hold 28 of the 51 seats with a majority of five. But with five different parties contesting this election, the Conservatives need only to avoid a net loss of two seats to retain power. This is the Green party's strongest area in the West Midlands and with only one of its seven seats up for election it is hoping it could become the official opposition. The Liberal Democrats' performance will be a key factor in a Parliamentary constituency where it had a majority over the Conservatives last time of just 175. 13. STRATFORD-ON-AVON A Conservative stronghold. It has 30 seats to the Liberal Democrats' 14  and Labour's one. But the headline numbers belie the catalogue of internal strife and defections, one way and another, which lies beneath. Since the last elections, three Conservatives have become independents and two Liberal Democrats have switched to the Conservatives. The election of a Labour councillor last year is said to have surprised the party. 14. TAMWORTH Labour will be fighting hard to gain the three seats it needs to end ten years of Conservative rule in the home of Sir Robert Peel, father of modern-day Toryism. Labour will be defending only three of the 12 seats it holds, having gained five in 2012. As in Cannock, UKIP polled strongly here in last year's county council elections in a Parliamentary seat where the Conservatives currently have a 6,000 majority. 15. WALSALL A knife-edge contest will be scrutinised for general election pointers where both Parliamentary seats are on the Conservatives' target list. But Labour need a net gain of just three seats to depose the Conservative-Liberal Democrat administration and take power for the first time since 2000. The Conservatives currently hold 25 seats, their Liberal Democrat partners, five and Labour 28. One possibility is that independent councillors may hold the balance of power. UKIP, too, could make an impact: it polled more than 10% in each of the 8 wards contested in 2012. 16. WOLVERHAMPTON With 44 of the council's 60 seats, Labour has a comfortable majority but drastic budgets cuts are seeing the administration cutting 20% of their workforce over the coming year. Who takes the blame, the council or the government? One of the city's three Parliamentary seats, Wolverhampton South West, is a Conservative marginal with a majority of under 700. 17. WORCESTER 'The Faithful City' has seen some high drama since its last elections two years ago which left the Conservatives and Labour tied on 16 seats each. The Conservatives formed an administration with Liberal Democrat support. But when one Conservative defected to Labour and the Liberal Democrats switched allegiances, Labour were able to replace the Conservatives with a minority administration of their own. This time the Conservatives have two key target seats, including the ward currently held by the Con-Lab defector. If the Conservatives were to capture either or both targets and retain the five it is defending it would return to power: a high-octane contest in a key marginal Parliamentary seat where the Conservatives currently have a majority of under 3,000. 18. WYRE FOREST More than a decade after 'People Power' carried all before it by taking control of the council and getting the Independent MP Richard Taylor elected for an unprecedented two terms at Westminster. Health Concern currently hold nine seats, one more than Labour, so a  key contest will be the battle for second place. The Conservatives, with 19 seats, currently have a minority administration. But the Liberal Democrats, thanks to a combination of defeats and defections currently have no seats at all. Here at least, they have been outlived by the Liberal Party: the un-de-merged Liberal Party of Lloyd George and Jo Grimmond will be defending one of their three seats. If you are still with me, you will have seen by now why we are always so keen to take stock of elections like these, especially with less than a year to go to the main event.  They are serious tests of opinion in a part of the country which is always one of the most important general election battlefields. Equally, you will have gathered by now that there with so many local quirks and sub plots, every local council election has a tale to tell that is all its own. (Just look again at Wyre Forest)  A reminder, if ever we needed one, that there are limits to how far we should go in interpreting the bigger electoral picture. This really is chiefly about electing councillors after all!

{"article": "Change yourselves or we will change you.  Theresa May's message to the police was as uncompromising as the black trousers and flat black lace ups she wore to deliver it.  No minister has spoken to the Police Federation like this. No-one has dared.  Today was the day when a representative of the trade union of home secretaries took on what is, in effect, the bobbies' trade union. It's something ministers - whether Tory or Labour - have dreamt of doing for years as each took their turn to face humiliation at the Fed's Conference.  Some were heckled, some slow handclapped, others heard in orchestrated silence.  All were told they were betraying police officers who had died or been injured in the line of duty. Two years ago Theresa May was forced to stand in front of a conference slogan which dubbed her policies \"criminal\". Today was payback time. Why, though, did she do what her predecessors did not?  First, because the shocking list of police misconduct which she read out today - from Hillsborough to Lawrence to Tomlinson - has changed the public mood. Second, because deep cuts to police budgets and numbers have not led to the surge in lawlessness they predicted. Crime has, in fact, fallen.  Thirdly, because Plebgate revealed to the public gaze the misconduct politicians had suspected for years.  There is, though, one other reason.  Theresa May is an ambitious politician who knows people are eyeing her as a possible future leader of her party. She knew today that standing up to the police might prove as good for her career as standing up for them proved to be for politicians in the past. Below are the key messages and extracts of the home secretary's speech: I know many of you were sceptical. I know you meant it when you said that spending cuts would destroy the police as we know it, that the front line service would be ruined and that crime would go shooting up.\u2026But today we can say with confidence that spending cuts have not ended policing as we know it, the front line service has largely been maintained, and most important of all - according to both recorded crime statistics and the independent crime survey - crime is down by more than 10% since the election.  In the last few years, we have seen the Leveson Inquiry. The appalling conclusions of the Hillsborough independent panel. The death of Ian Tomlinson and the sacking of PC Harwood. The ongoing inquiry by an independent panel into the murder of Daniel Morgan. The first sacking of a chief constable for gross misconduct in modern times. The investigation of more than ten senior officers for acts of alleged misconduct and corruption. Allegations of rigged recorded crime statistics. The sacking of PCs Keith Wallis, James Glanville and Gillian Weatherley after \"Plebgate\". Worrying reports by the inspectorate about stop and search and domestic violence. The Herne Review into the conduct of the Metropolitan Police Special Demonstration Squad. The Ellison Review into allegations of corruption during the investigation of the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Further allegations that the police sought to smear Stephen\u201fs family. Soon, there will be another judge-led public inquiry into policing. When you remember the list of recent revelations about police misconduct, it is not enough to mouth platitudes about \"a few bad apples\". The problem might lie with a minority of officers, but it is still a significant problem, and a problem that needs to be addressed.\u2026 It cannot be right when officers under investigation by the IPCC comply with the rules by turning up for interview but then refuse to cooperate and decline to answer questions. Such behaviour - which I am told is often encouraged by the Federation - reveals an attitude that is far removed from the principles of public service felt by the majority of police officers. It is the same attitude exposed by HMIC when officers, called to help a woman who had suffered domestic violence, accidentally recorded themselves calling the victim a \"slag\" and a \"bitch\". It is the same attitude expressed when young black men ask the police why they are being stopped and searched and are told it is \"just routine\" even though according to the law, officers need \"reasonable grounds for suspicion\". It is an attitude that betrays contempt for the public these officers are supposed to serve - and every police officer in the land, every single police leader, and everybody in the Police Federation should confront it and expunge it from the ranks. The Police Federation is an organisation created by statute, it serves a public function and the Normington Review demonstrated very clearly that it is an organisation in need of greater transparency and accountability. So it is a change that I believe needs to be made.Change yourselves or we will change you. Theresa May's message to the police was as uncompromising as the black trousers and flat black lace ups she wore to deliver it.

The research into the quality of Britain's 26,000 public parks is expected to conclude that new ways of financing their maintenance are essential to prevent a return to the crisis days of the 1990s. MPs then described our urban green spaces as \"shunned, neglected and vandalised\". The warning about the decay of UK parks came at a meeting held among the manicured and flawless exhibits at the Chelsea Flower Show. \"We know from talking to park managers, friends groups and the public that we need to do something pretty serious if we are not going to face the same crisis we had in the past,\" Drew Bennellick from HLF said. \"Our research, published next month, shows that we are right on the edge of a precipice at the moment.\" Although many parks still outwardly look in good condition, the survey has identified how \"neglect has started to creep back in\".  In some places key infrastructure has not been properly maintained and lakes and ponds have not been dredged, next month's report will reveal. Public sector funding for discretionary services like parks is projected to fall by 60% or more over the next ten years, whoever wins the election in 2015.   \"Everybody realises that the old model won't do us for the next decade,\" says Graham Duxbury, chief executive of the environmental charity Groundwork. \"This isn't a case of muddling through.\" Mr Duxbury believes the notion that community volunteers can take responsibility for the UK's vital green infrastructure is misplaced.  \"Communities want to do more but not many of them can make that whole journey towards managing an asset like a park, running a business or a social enterprise,\" he says. \"You very easily get to burn out.\" The Heritage Lottery Fund is to fund a series of pilot schemes testing new ways of bridging the gap between what state and community can together provide and what Britain's public parks need to prevent decay.  \"It might be looking at endowments, public subscriptions, park improvement districts working with local business or ecosystem services where people pay parks to deliver draining solutions, for instance,\" says Mr Bennellick. Designer Wayne Hemingway, who chairs the Building for Life organisation, thinks big business should provide the answer. \"One of the reasons [David] Cameron doesn't go on about the Big Society any more is that it is not as big as he would like it to be,\" he says. \"Big business is doing pretty well - it would be very easy to show the value to them of taking part ownership of a park.\" Mr Hemingway suggested limited naming rights might be offered to local companies, echoing the 19th century philanthropic traditions that created the public park as we know it. For instance, among the earliest were Philips Park in Manchester and Peel Park in Salford, named after their benefactors, the politicians Mark Philips and Sir Robert Peel. Groundwork has designed an exhibit for the Chelsea Flower Show that focuses on the little patches of green, often in unpromising places, that can be enormously valuable to local communities. It is these smaller parks that the charity fears are most at risk when funding is cut. \"The people who come to Chelsea share a love of all things green,\" Mr Duxbury says. \"The message we want to get across is that that is also true for those who can't come to Chelsea, who don't have a large garden where they can experience the calming, restorative, healing benefits of green space.\"   ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27500649", "title": ["Parks in peril"]},
{"article": "Politics is one of the most complex areas of human thought. So when I heard the claim that scanning people's brains could predict political choices, I was naturally sceptical.  Brain science is achieving extraordinary insights, but mapping what you can measure in a brain scanner on to human social interactions is a huge leap, like trying to find exact correlations between two bowls of soup - only one soup is made from vegetables, macaroni and stock, and the other soup is made up of abstract ideas like economics, equality and history. But in the US and in Britain, psychologists and neuroscientists are doing serious research into linking political attitudes to what goes on inside our skulls.   \"By looking at how the brain is processing political phenomena, we can understand a little better why we're doing what we're doing,\" says Darren Schreiber, of Exeter University.  He started using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) while in America, to look at patterns of activity in the brain when people made decisions, especially those involving risk.  Writer and performer Timandra Harkness investigates how our political views are linked to the way our brains function. Personality Politics will be Broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 BST on Tuesday 20 May 2014 While their decisions weren't all that different, Dr Schreiber saw variation in the parts of the brain that were most active in self-described conservatives and those who called themselves liberal.  He won't generalise about exactly how conservatives and liberals think, but he does think his work suggests that differing political outlooks reflect deep-seated divergence in how we understand the world. Neuroscientist Read Montague, of University College London and Virginia Tech, was sceptical when approached to help political scientists with their research.  \"I laughed them out of the room,\" he says. But when John Hibbing and his team at the University of Nebraska showed him their data he changed his tune.  Their studies of twins suggested that political allegiance was partly genetic.  Not as strongly as height, for example, but enough to suggest that some people really could be dyed-in-the-wool conservatives - or dyed-in-the-DNA, at least. People like to believe that their own political beliefs are rational\u201d But how, exactly, could genetic differences be expressed as political differences in the real world?  Dr Hibbing and Dr Montague wanted to know if these innate predispositions could be observed at work in the brain.  So they tested instinctive responses to images designed to provoke disgust and fear, and found a link between the strength of response to the pictures, and how socially conservative a person's views were likely to be.  \"We need to make clear the distinction between economic conservatism and social conservatism,\" says Dr Hibbing.  \"People who have more protective attitudes about things like immigration, who are more eager to punish criminals, people who oppose abortion... these are individuals who seem to have a much stronger reaction to disgusting images.\"  These reactions are measured biologically, so the studies are linking explicit, conscious opinions with subconscious responses. In the research done so far, it's attitudes to risk, disgust and fear that show the strongest links to overt political views.  The difficulty comes when trying to apply these insights to a specific situation.  American social conservatives might also be strongly in favour of a smaller state and a freer market. In former Eastern bloc countries, social conservatism might make you more likely to hanker after the old days of Communism.  Behavioural economist Liam Delaney is studying the psychology of the Scottish independence referendum campaigns, but he warns against thinking that our subconscious instincts can be a complete guide to the debate.  Human politics is extraordinarily complex... If people were simplistic we wouldn't need these very big, complex brains\u201d \"Biological determinism is a little tricky with these situations, because there's just too much variation across different political systems.   \"So I think you'd risk simplifying things by saying that there is a hard-wire that's determining the outcome.\" Darren Schreiber agrees: \"Human politics is extraordinarily complex. It's not just reduced to brain, and I want to be very clear that I'm not a biological determinist. We're hardwired not to be hardwired.  \"If people were simplistic we wouldn't need these very big, complex brains.\" None of the scientists doing this research claims that our political views are completely innate.  Human brains change throughout our lives, so neuroscientists are careful to say that our experiences, as well as our genes, have shaped the brain they're putting in the scanner. But John Hibbing believes our subconscious drives, which evolved long ago in response to urgent physical dangers, direct our political minds more than we like to think.  \"People like to believe that their own political beliefs are rational, that they're a sensible response to the world around them, so when we come along and say, 'Maybe there are these predispositions, influential but perhaps not fully in your conscious awareness,' that's not the way we like to view our own political beliefs.\" He compares our innate ideological tendencies to which hand we prefer to use. We used to think of this as a habit that could be changed, yet now know it to be \"deeply embedded in biology\". That would have profound implications for political life. If being left-wing is as innate as being left-handed, why bother with politics at all?  Could we just put everybody in a brain scanner and infer what they think, and will always think, and were born to think, and stop trying to change anybody's mind? I was relieved to find that even John Hibbing doesn't draw that conclusion. \"It's not so much that I think people should just shut up and accept that some people are different. But I do think they should accept that some people are either not going to change or they're going to be extremely difficult to change, and that simply by continuing to shout at them, we're not contributing to anything.\" So we won't be swapping the ballot box for the brain scanner, any time soon.  Which is good, because I still think politics should be about taking our ideas out into the world beyond our skulls, the real world of challenging beliefs and clashing opinions. Perhaps I'm just hard-wired to think that way. ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27437799", "title": ["Does brain structure determine your political views?"]},

{"article": "The governor of the Bank of England has put on record his concern that the greatest risk to the UK's recovery are the red-hot conditions in the London property market, the potential for contagion to the rest of the country, and the associated risk that banks may be lending recklessly. Clever clogs Lloyds, that most politically astute of banks, has responded by announcing that if you want to borrow more than \u00a3500,000, you will only get the loan if its value is no greater than four times the income of your household. \"Wah?\" you may say, if you are of a certain age. \"When I was a lad, you were lucky to get a loan of three times income.\" Which only goes to show that some pretty racy mortgages are being written by banks and building societies in the London and south east.  Perhaps the most amazing thing said by Lloyds yesterday is that this new constraint would have an impact on 8% of its London home loans business (and see my piece on last night's   for more on all of this). Bloomin' 'eck.  So to repeat what I said yesterday, it would be a bit odd if the Bank of England's new Financial Policy Committee did nought next month to take   of the residential property market. Anyway, this is a long pre-amble to a tangential point, which is that not all Mark Carney's colleagues at the Bank regard the bubblelicious housing market as the most worrying possible sinkhole on our journey to the sunny uplands of renewed prosperity. Which may surprise you a bit. But they take the view that after years of stagnation, property prices were bound to get a bit racy, once we all got a sniff of economic recovery. But that the Bank has important new tools to insulate banks and the wider economy from extreme housing-related shocks.  Hmmm. We'll see. The Financial Policy Committee's new tools are untested.  Gawd knows whether they'll be used in a timely and appropriate way, or whether they'll have adverse unexpected consequences.  But I suppose the bigger point is that British homes aren't the only asset currently looking a bit toppy, in the jargon. I am prohibited from recounting the contents of private conversations with Bank brains on all this. But I can give you this resonant quote from Charlie Bean, the retiring deputy governor of the Bank of England, who last night gave a valedictory speech at the London School of Economics. This is what Mr Bean said: \"Implied volatilities in many financial markets have been at historically low levels for some time. Together with low safe interest rates in the advance economies, that has underpinned a renewed search for yield and encouraged carry trades [where investors borrow cheaply to invest in assets offering a nominally higher return, but where that return is not necessarily higher when underlying risk is taken into account]. \"Taken in isolation, this is eerily reminiscent of what happened in the run-up to the crisis\". Or to put it another way, those controlling the world's great pools of money believe the world is a much safer place than it really is, and are taking foolhardy risks with their investments. In fact, the Bank's internal analysis shows that investors are behaving more irrationally and exuberantly even than perhaps implied by Mr Bean - the volatility of a raft of the world's most liquid and important assets, from shares, to currencies to government bonds, is lower even than at the peak of the boom before the devastating crash of 2007-8. So as and when any of the following possible accidents materialise - exacerbation of turmoil in Ukraine, a hard financial landing in China, cack-handed end of the era of free money in the developed economies, inter alia - \"we may yet encounter a few potholes\". Or so Mr Bean puts it, perhaps euphemistically. One of the great possible sources of future instability is the great overhang of government and official debt acquired by the central banks of the big rich economies through the money-creation exercise known as quantitative easing. Mr Bean signals that the Bank of England will not wish merely to sit on the \u00a3375bn of gilts or UK government bonds it has bought, and see that debt mountain gradually shrink as the Treasury repays on the assorted due dates. If the Bank were to do that, the unwinding of quantitative easing, the withdrawal of the new cash from the economy, would take around 50 years - which would be too long, he seems to think. So at some point, he says, the Bank of England will start to flog some of this stuff back to investors. When? Well it ain't going to be very soon. Because there is a risk that investors and the market would react quite adversely - pushing down the price of debt, and increasing implied interest rates pretty sharply. There could, therefore, be an over-reaction, in which the price of money would rise sharply, to the detriment of the wider economy. Which is why Mr Bean says the Bank cannot start to sell its gilts till the official interest rate has been raised to a high enough level, such that the Bank could make an emergency cut in it, as a form of evasive action.  But in spelling that out, Mr Bean has telegraphed to hedge funds and other investors the rules of a potentially lucrative game - the losers of which could be all of us. In that the rational thing for any investor to do would be to dump gilts in size as the Bank's policy rate was raised, to pre-empt and perhaps even deter possible gilt sales by the Bank (such that the investors could buy the gilts back at a depressed price, in the expectation of a bounce). Lucky Mr Bean is, of course, exiting the crucible of all this potential future mayhem before we find out whether the Bank of England will show wisdom and sensitivity in disposing of the debt and withdrawing \u00a3375bn of cash from the economy, or will emulate his famously accident-prone namesake.

{"article": "The Court of Appeal has overturned a decision to halt a fraud trial because of a lack of specialist criminal barristers prepared to take on the work.  I've covered the initial row over the prosecution - known as \"Operation Cotton\" -  The stakes could not have been higher going into the Court of Appeal. Had Sir Brian Leveson and the two other senior judges hearing the case upheld the stay of the prosecution, it would have amounted to a hammer blow to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's attempts to slash some parts of the legal aid bill.  Perhaps more importantly than the finances of the public purse, it could have brought the wheels of justice in complex and very high-cost criminal trials to a grinding halt.  So why did the Court of Appeal overrule Judge Anthony Leonard QC? His judgement was that the defendants could not find any specialist self-employed barristers or advocates who were employed by a government agency called the Public Defender Service.  Barristers had refused to sign new contracts for Very High Cost Cases after a 30% cut in fees - and the PDS, a government agency, was said to have nobody suitable available.  During the appeal, the Ministry of Justice said that it had implemented emergency measures to recruit more public defenders.  If that recruitment drive is successful, then ministers hope they will have sufficient barristers on the books to undertake work in cases like Operation Cotton - and that the costs will be lower than legal aid payments to traditional self-employed advocates.  , the Court of Appeal says that it is \"undeniably the responsibility\" of the Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling to sort out how the men in Operation Cotton are going to be represented.  So, quite simply, the Court said that while there may come a time when the case could not go ahead because of a lack of representation, that time had not yet come.  Sir Brian Leveson said: \"On our analysis there was a sufficient prospect of a sufficient number of PDS advocates who were then available who would enable a trial to proceed in January 2015. That pool included a sufficient number of advocates of the rank of QC.\" So the ball is now firmly in the Ministry of Justice's court. But even if Operation Cotton does finally get to trial, the judgement has not made the bigger problem go away. There needs to be some kind of new long-term deal between barristers and the government (that is assuming that the government isn't going to continue to expand the PDS).    And that's why Sir Brian Leveson has inserted a carefully worded observation at the end of the judgement.  He said that the criminal justice system needed the best possible advocates to ensure trials were fair, efficient and avoided potential miscarriages of justice.  \"We have no doubt that it is critical that there remains a thriving cadre of advocates capable of undertaking all types of publicly-funded work.\" Perhaps, most importantly, he notes that some of those advocates will be the judges of the future - the subtext being that if the government wants good decisions in the courts, then it needs to ensure the best people see a future in the business. \"In those circumstances, it is of fundamental importance that the Ministry of Justice, led by the Lord Chancellor, and the professions continue to try to resolve the impasse that presently stands in the way of the delivery of justice in the most complex of cases. \"The maintenance of a criminal justice system of which we can be proud depends on a sensible resolution.\" ", "subject": "Politics", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27504595", "title": ["Operation Cotton: Court of Appeal ruling explained"]}]
