[{"article": "Novelist Sue Townsend, best known as the author of the successful Adrian Mole series, has died. Townsend, 68, died at home on Thursday after a short illness. The first of her comic series, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4, was published in 1982 and the eighth instalment, Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years, was released in 2009. Her other best-selling novels included The Queen and I.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Townsend, who was left blind after suffering from diabetes for many years, achieved worldwide success following the publication of the books about teenager Adrian Mole. The series followed the main character from adolescence under Margaret Thatcher's government, to maturity in Tony Blair's Britain. Townsend said that, in many respects, her hero mirrored her own experience. In March 2013, she told the Oxford Literary Festival that publication of the next Adrian Mole book had been pushed back as a result of a stroke she had suffered. She was diagnosed with diabetes in the 1980s and underwent a kidney transplant in 2009. She had the stroke in December 2012. Comedian and writer Danny Wallace is one of a number of those who have paid tribute to Townsend. Wallace told the BBC: \"If ever I saw that she was in a town close to me - and I'd never been to book readings or book signings before - but I always made sure I went to hers. \"She was incredibly sweet to her younger fans and I've got all these books at home that she had signed and she would say, 'To Daniel, from Sue Townsend aged 43 and three quarters' or '45 and a half'. \"So she really understood what people loved about Adrian Mole I think.\"  Media requires JavaScript to play. Actor Stephen Mangan, who played Adrian Mole in a 2001 television adaptation, told Radio 4's Today programme that Townsend took him \"under her wing\" during filming.  \"There was something really special about Sue. She was a hero of mine when I read the books as an adolescent - I was pretty much the same age as Adrian - but when I met her I just fell in love with her really,\" he said.  \"She was warm, she was funny, she was self-deprecating. She was incredibly encouraging.  \"It was the first time I'd ever played a lead part in a series and, however confident I must have tried to appear, she instinctively knew how difficult it was for me to come and lead a company with people like Alison Steadman and Zoe Wanamaker and Helen Baxendale. I'll miss her a lot.\" Harry Potter author JK Rowling  , writing \"So sad to hear about Sue Townsend. She gave me so many laughs.\" She added: \"#AdrianMoleWillLiveForever.\" David Walliams also  on the social networking site, calling Townsend \"a comedy genius\" and \"lovely lady\" who wrote \"some of the funniest books of all time\".  Crime writer Ian Rankin described her death as \"a real loss\". Writer Caitlin Moran   Townsend was \"one of the funniest women who ever lived.\" Townsend was born in Leicester in 1946, and set her most famous work in her home city. The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4, was followed by The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole in 1984. The two books made her the best-selling novelist of the 1980s and they were followed by others in the Mole series, including The True Confessions of Adrian Albert Mole. Several of her books were adapted for the stage, while the Mole series was adapted for radio, television and theatre. Townsend was awarded an honorary Masters of Arts from Leicester University and in 2008 was made a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the university. She was also an Honorary Doctor of Letters at Loughborough University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 2009 Townsend was given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester.  She said at the time: \"I have been a citizen of Leicester for over 62 years, most of my family and friends live here, so I was delighted when I was nominated to receive the freedom of the city.\" She leaves her husband and four children.

{"article": "Making films that specifically target older people is \"a mistake\", according to Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson.  Many studios have tried to capitalise on the success of films like Calendar Girls and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, both of which had older casts. But Thompson told BBC Radio 4's   that separating audiences into groups was \"a mistake culturally, artistically and economically.\" The actress appeared on the show to promote her new film, The Love Punch.  The film, which co-stars Pierce Brosnan and Celia Imrie, has a slightly older cast than a typical Hollywood blockbuster, but Thompson said it aimed \"to entertain everybody\". \"This film isn't for older people, that would be a tragic mistake to indicate that we were making this for older people,\" she said.  \"What I find really fantastic about it is that it's young people who seem to enjoy it just as much, if not more.\" Thompson continued: \"I don't see where age has to come into it - it's been made to entertain everybody in the groups that we're supposed to be in, which is a selection of ages. \"The fact is that the film industry has tried to separate us into groups, and it's a mistake culturally, artistically and economically.\"  The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which starred Dame Judi Dench, Dame Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy as British pensioners at a retirement hotel in India, took $134m (\u00a383m) worldwide in 2012.  It was a huge return on an estimated $10m (\u00a36.2m) budget and a sequel is currently being filmed. Titles such as Last Vegas, Quartet and A Song for Marion have followed in its wake.  They are said to be targeting the \"grey pound\" - targeting the ageing population, who can often visit the cinema during the quieter daytime periods. \"I long for the day where we don't have to talk about our age as actresses,\" said Imrie, pointing out that her character's age in The Love Punch was \"incidental\" to the plot.  \"I don't want us to have to bang on about it anymore, because the more actresses go on the more interesting and fascinating they are,\" Imrie told Front Row.  \"You look into an older woman's face and there's a whole lifetime of life, and that's what we're depicting.  \"It's very rare that we're ever asked to play actresses, we're asked to play people in life and therefore the more life you live the richer, hopefully, you can be.\"  Thompson told presenter John Wilson that women have to fight for roles as they get older: \"Not only fighting for the roles, but fighting for female rights in general.\" \"For women a lot of the time, the only power that they do have in their roles on screen is the sexual power,\" Thompson added.  \"So when that sexuality becomes older, and therefore a great deal more threatening, the roles dry up - because women don't have access to the kinds of power that create the kind of story that people are writing about. \"The roles of women in life - in political life, business life, everything - are absolutely mirrored by what we see in cinema.\" Thompson was last seen on screen as Mary Poppins creator PL Travers in Saving Mr Banks and recently filmed Jason Reitman's Men, Women and Children.  She said it was important to \"challenge yourself\" by taking on different kinds of roles. \"I think it was after Sense and Sensibility my Mum said, 'So what are you going to do next, are you going to play another good woman in a frock?'. And I thought, 'Bloody hell, thanks Mum.' But I know what she meant.\" Thompson continued: \"If you challenge yourself to do something different, I think the more experience you have the more interesting it is to meet that challenge, and sometimes really surprising things come out of it.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26971676", "title": ["Emma Thompson criticises 'grey pound' films for older audiences"]},

Nirvana were among the acts inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Grunge band Nirvana have been enlisted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, alongside the likes of Kiss and Beatles manager Brian Epstein. REM's Michael Stipe inducted the group, saying: \"Nirvana tapped into a voice that was yearning to be heard.  \"Nirvana were kicking against the mainstream. They spoke truth and a lot of people listened.\"  Nirvana fans walk up to me every day and say thank you for the music\u201d The band's career was cut short by Kurt Cobain's death in 1994. His widow, Courtney Love, attended the ceremony. \"You know, I have a big speech, but I'm not going to say it,\" she said, before hugging Cobain's bandmates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl. \"That's it,\" she concluded. \"I just wish Kurt was here to do this.\" Grohl, Nirvana's drummer and now frontman of rock group Foo Fighters, paid tribute to the musicians who formed the early line-ups of Nirvana, in particular drummer Chad Channing, who he singled out for his contributions to the band's breakthrough album Nevermind. Bass guitarist Novoselic added: \"Nirvana fans walk up to me every day and say thank you for the music. \"When I hear that, I think of Kurt Cobain.\" Nirvana received their place in the Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Artists can only be considered for the honour 25 years after their first release. The remaining members, also including guitarist Pat Smear, were joined on stage by four female musicians to perform some of the band's best-known songs. Joan Jett sang Smells Like Teen Spirit, Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon took on Aneurysm, alternative musician St. Vincent performed Lithium, while New Zealand pop star Lorde sang All Apologies. Other honourees at the New York ceremony included Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, 15 years after their leader was inducted as a solo artist. He welcomed the band on stage, saying: \"I told a story with the E Street Band that was, and is, bigger than anything I could have told on my own.\"  \"We suffered ageing, illness and death together,\" Springsteen said. \"We took care of each other when trouble knocked, and we hurt each other in big and small ways. In the end, we stuck with each other.\" Their induction took 85 minutes, including performances of The E Street Shuffle, The River and Kitty's Back. They were followed into the Hall of Fame by Maneater singers Daryl Hall and John Oates.  \"Lucky for you, there are only two of us,\" Hall said to laughter from the audience.  Britain's Peter Gabriel was inducted by Coldplay singer Chris Martin, and made light of his elaborate stage outfits as a member of Genesis in the 1970s. \"Dream big, and let your imagination guide you, even if you end up dressing as a flower or a sexually transmitted disease.\" Another British honouree was Cat Stevens, whose hits included Matthew and Son and Wild World. \"Thanks so much to my fans for believing,\" said Stevens, who gave up music for 25 years after converting to Islam and changing his name to Yusuf Islam in 1977. \"I can still see some sceptical faces, but my fans believed.\" Rock legends Kiss were one of the more controversial inductees, having pulled out of a performance at the ceremony over a disagreement about their line-up. Famous for their elaborate stage make-up and costumes, the band wanted to play with their current line-up, including founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, causing friction with retired members Ace Frehley and Peter Criss. I think those people basically hijacked the name rock and roll\u201d But the quartet made peace and saluted each other in heartfelt induction speeches.  \"This is a pivotal moment for all of us,\" said Simmons, the bass player on hits like Crazy Nights and Rock and Roll All Nite.  \"We are humbled that the fans gave us the chance to do what we loved doing.\" Country queen Linda Ronstadt, who has Parkinson's disease, was unable to attend the ceremony, instead receiving a musical tribute from Carrie Underwood, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow and Stevie Nicks. Glenn Frey, who played in Ronstadt's band before joining the Eagles, led her induction with a glowing tribute to \"one of the greatest voices of all time\". \"Linda Ronstadt recorded 31 albums. She sold over 100 million records and had a career that spanned five decades,\" he said.  \"She has been a shining example and a true inspiration to every woman who ever stood in front of a microphone and sang her heart out.\" The ceremony also saw the first ever inductions for managers of rock bands, which went to the late Brian Epstein, who guided the Beatles to stardom, and Andrew Loog Oldham, who launched the careers of the Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart and Eric Clapton. However, the former Stones' manager boycotted the ceremony. \"I won't be there,\" he said at a  . \"I'll tell you why: It's a television show.  \"Twenty years ago, it was an incredible party in the Waldorf-Astoria where everybody could behave exactly as they could 20 years ago.  \"And then it became a business.

{"article": "Five musicians have taken legal action against the National Theatre after being stripped of their roles in the West End production of War Horse. The musicians are seeking a High Court injunction to be allowed back into the show until the full case can be heard.  The High Court heard the National Theatre had opted to use pre-recorded music instead of live performers. The group said they had continued to show up for nightly performances only to be turned away. The five, who had been with the hit show since 2009, had their roles cut back in March 2013 to just a few minutes per performance, until live music was cut altogether in March this year. Lawyers for the five -  Neyire Ashworth, Andrew Callard, Jonathan Eddie, David Holt and Colin Rae - told the court they were given 11 days notice of the contract termination but had continued to arrive on time for daily shows. \"The claimants have not accepted this breach of their contracts, and have elected to affirm their contracts. They have at all times made it clear that they remain willing and able to attend work and to perform their obligations under their contracts,\" said James Laddie QC. The National Theatre contests that it was bringing the London production in line with War Horse stage shows around the world, which do not use live music.  Representing the National Theatre, David Reade QC said the theatre was entitled to terminate the contracts of anyone whose services were no longer required.  He told the judge - who admitted he had not seen the show - that War Horse was a play which featured music rather than a full-blown musical.  \"As such, the orchestra was not an integral part of the play, and indeed there is no live band in any other production around the world,\" said Mr Reade. He added that it was \"frankly naive\" to think the musicians could return to their previous roles, and that a new cast had spent seven weeks rehearsing without live music. He said the National was not questioning the ability of the musicians but theatre management believed its live music budget would be better used elsewhere.  Judge Mr Justice Cranston said he would deliver his ruling on 15 April. War Horse is one of the National Theatre's most successful productions during the tenure of outgoing artistic director Sir Nicholas Hytner, having been seen by more than 2.5m people worldwide.

A number of breakthrough acts including Earl Sweatshirt, Wilkinson and Jess Glynn have also joined the lineup. The festival will be held on the weekend of 11 to 13 July.

{"article": "The fate of Mickey Rooney's remains will be decided this week, following the Hollywood actor's death on Sunday. A judge in Los Angeles will decide on Friday whether the remains will be released to his estranged eighth wife or his lawyer, Michael Augustine. According to court documents, Rooney's most recent will, dated 11 March, left his modest estate to stepson Mark Aber. The actor had previously sued his other stepson, Christopher Aber, alleging elder abuse and fiscal mismanagement. Mark Aber - also known as Mark Rooney - and Christopher Aber are the sons of Janice Rooney, who Mickey Rooney married in 1978. The 93-year-old disinherited his wife and all his children in his last will, leaving his $18,000 (\u00a310,726) estate to Mark who had served, with his wife, as his caregiver. Michael Augustine was granted a court order on Tuesday preventing Janice Rooney from removing the actor's remains from a mortuary in Glendale, California. Rooney, a Hollywood legend whose film and musical career spanned nine decades, was no longer living with his wife at the time of his death from natural causes. The actor, loved by millions for his work in National Velvet and the Andy Hardy films, is survived by eight children as well as his two stepsons. He designated Augustine to serve as the executor of his estate, stating he did not want any of his relatives handling his affairs. In 2011, the actor testified before a US Senate committee that he had been emotionally and financially abused by family members. According to his lawyer, the actor owned a burial plot northwest of Los Angeles but had recently said he wanted to be buried in Hollywood or a veterans' cemetery.

Auctioneers expect great interest in the 1940s albums, and the paintings could fetch a six-figure sum at the annual Bonhams Scottish sale. A huge range of items including whisky, highland dress and Weymss pottery figures are also up for auction. The sale takes place at Bonhams Edinburgh saleroom on Queen Street over two days from 15 April. Highlights include a number of works by the Scottish Colourists, including three paintings by Francis Cadell. The two Broons albums were published in 1940 and 1942, while the Oor Wullie book dates from 1941. Produced by Dundee publisher DC Thomson, they were created by cartoonist Dudley Dexter Watkins, who drew the strips in his Broughty Ferry home until he died in 1969. Each of the three albums up for auction is valued at around \u00a33,000. Bonhams book specialist Henry Baggott said it was rare to find albums in such good condition as such books were usually heavily used by children. He said: \"They do turn up but the condition of them is generally very bad, covers dirty and pages missing. \"What is amazing about these is that they look like they have been untouched by human hands, least of all by children's hands.  \"I'm expecting lots of interest in them. They have appeared at auction in the past and sold very well.\" The paintings by Edinburgh-born Francis Cadell are expected to fetch high five-figure or even six-figure sums. Cadell was a leading member of the post-impressionist Scottish Colourist movement in the 1920s and 1930s which went on to have a key influence on contemporary Scottish art and culture.

It will be performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. Local-born mezzo soprano Kathryn Rudge will sing the names of the 96 Liverpool football fans who lost their lives. They died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 and their families are currently appearing at fresh inquests into their deaths.  They are being held in Warrington after being ordered in December 2012, when the High Court quashed the original accidental death verdicts. Nyman said he hopes the work will make \"a small but significant contribution to the healing process still necessary for the families of the lost fans.\" The symphony will be performed at Liverpool Cathedral, with the orchestra and Rudge accompanied by the Liverpool Philharmonic Youth and Training Choirs, conducted by Josep Vicent. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said the city would \"never forget those who lost their lives at Hillsborough\".  \"Memorials are a symbol of our solidarity and support for the families, and Nyman's specially commissioned piece of music will be a moving and unforgettable tribute,\" said Anderson.  \"It is certain to be a highlight of this year's Biennial and a fantastic example of art being used to help shine a light on the dignity and bravery of those who have strived for justice for the 96,\" he added.  The symphony is inspired by Nyman's piece of music known as Memorial, a funeral march-style piece composed in 1985 - subsequently used in the film The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, starring Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren.

{"article": "The BBC was \"far too complacent\" in its handling of a failed IT project that cost licence fee payers \u00a398.4m.  The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was intended to move the BBC away from using and storing video tape. But it was scrapped, with almost no results, after five years of development.  After investigating the demise of the project,  has branded the programme \"a complete failure\". Chairman Margaret Hodge said the BBC needed to \"overhaul\" its approach to such projects, to \"safeguard licence fee payers' money\". The BBC originally approved DMI in 2006. It was supposed to produce new editing tools, an online archive of the BBC's programmes and a new database. Technology company Siemens was hired to develop the project in February 2008, and it was expected to be completed the following year. However, after a series of delays, the project was brought in-house, There it floundered until last May, when the BBC's incoming director general, Tony Hall, admitted it had \"wasted a huge amount of licence fee payers' money\". The gross estimate of the amount spent on DMI was \u00a3125.9m, although the BBC claims to have recouped \u00a327.5m of that. The BBC's technology chief, John Linwood, was sacked in July 2013 over the project's demise. A previous report, by the National Audit Office (NAO), blamed \"confusion and a lack of planning\" for the failure. It said that senior executives failed to take control of the project when it ran into trouble and \"did not appear to appreciate the extent of the problems until a late stage\". The PAC published its own findings on Thursday. It reiterated several of the points raised in earlier reports and criticised the BBC for its failure to alert MPs of the problems. \"When my committee examined the DMI's progress in February 2011, the BBC told us that the DMI was... absolutely essential... and that a lot of the BBC's future was tied up in the successful delivery of the DMI,\" said Ms Hodge. \"The BBC also told us that it was using the DMI to make many programmes and was on track to complete the system in 2011 with no further delays.  \"This turned out not to be the case. In reality the BBC only ever used the DMI to make one programme, called Bang Goes the Theory. \"The BBC was far too complacent about the high risks involved in taking it in-house. No single individual had overall responsibility or accountability for delivering the DMI and achieving the benefits, or took ownership of problems when they arose.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"Tony Hall was right to scrap the DMI project when he took over as director general last year. As we said at the time, the BBC didn't get DMI right and we apologised to licence fee payers.  \"Since then we have completely overhauled how these projects are delivered so that there is crystal clear accountability and transparency.\" A spokeswoman for the BBC Trust, the corporation's governing body, said: \"As we have said before, this represented an unacceptable loss to licence fee payers. \"Acting on the conclusions of previous reports into DMI, we have strengthened reporting to the Trust so that problems are spotted early and dealt with quickly.  \"We are also carrying out follow up reviews once projects are completed to make sure the lessons from DMI are being implemented.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26963723", "title": ["BBC was 'complacent' over failed \u00a3100m IT project"]},

{"article": "Bummed out and drugged up, Tove Lo turned a failed relationship into pop gold. She talks to the BBC about her unflinching lyrics, and the correct way to pronounce her name. There's a moment on Tove Lo's debut EP that will take your breath away. It comes on the final track,  , where some bore is telling the Swedish singer \"time will heal\" her broken heart. Suddenly, the music vanishes into a black hole and Tove yells: \"Are you   me?\"   I once set another girl's hair on fire accidentally\u201d It's pained and bruised and thrilling and glorious. A moment where meaning and musical intent align perfectly. \"I've always wanted my music to have that desperation,\" the singer says, \"where you just want to strip your clothes off and run down the highway.\" \"I want the feeling where you don't really know what to do with yourself - in the vocals, in the production. Everything.\" The 26-year-old cut her teeth writing songs for Girls Aloud and fellow Swedes Icona Pop, but her solo material is altogether more visceral. Her Truth Serum EP is an unflinching document of a failed relationship. \"Not my first,\" she says, \"but certainly the most intense\". The key track is Habits, currently playlisted on Radio 1, and written in the immediate aftermath of the break-up. \"You're gone, and I've got to stay high all the time to keep you off my mind,\" she sings.   downing shots and hooking up with strangers, then crying uncontrollably in a nightclub toilet. \"When they heard it, my friends were like, 'Boy, you're really giving it all away',\" the singer says. \"For my family, I think it was harder. My mum gets a bit worried. \"She sent me a text: 'I can understand the new video gives a very honest perspective of the song, but I will never, ever watch it again.'\" Sadly for her mum, Habits - with its catalogue of bad decisions, bad boyfriends and banned substances - is all-too-real.  \"I can't lie,\" Tove says. \"What I'm singing about is my life. It's the truth.  \"I've had moments where that [drug-taking] has been a bigger part than it should be.  \"It's hard to admit to, and I could filter it or find another metaphor for it - but it doesn't feel right to me.\" The man who inspired Truth Serum is a \"very spiritual, very special guy,\" the singer says. \"After he heard Habits, he sent me one very long, very self-destructive poem. He said everything I was saying, but from his end. Since then I haven't spoken to him.\" Despite her no-nonsense approach, Tove balances melodrama and melancholy with a twisted, and distinctly Scandinavian, sense of humour. An earlier, self-released single,  , parodies the preposterous promises musicians make in love songs.  \"Chop off my hands, chop off my feet,\" she sings, \"I'd do it for you. Ain't love sweet?\" At one point, she even threatens to set herself on fire. Not, one hopes, a lyric based on experience. \"No!\" she laughs. \"I have never set myself on fire... But I did once set another girl's hair on fire accidentally. \"We had an argument in a bar and she was walking away. I took out my lighter and kind of waved it in her direction, like \" \", and it accidentally caught in her hair.  \"There were fumes coming out, so I ran after her and patted her on the back to put it out, but she thought I was trying to hit her. It was really awkward.\" She might sound like a handful, but in person Tove Lo is likeable and slightly shy - fiddling with her hair and book-ending answers with a soft giggle. Born Ebba Tove Elsa Nilsson, she grew up in a \"pretty posh family\" in the Stockholm suburb of Djursholm.  Her life-long nickname \"Lo\" is Swedish for Lynx - a tufty species of wildcat she \"fell in love with\" while visiting an animal park. \"Three years old, I was standing with my face pressed against the glass,\" she recalls. \"I didn't want to leave. So my parents started calling me Tove Lo and it stuck.\" Home life was comfortable. \"We had a nice house,\" she says. \"We lived by the water and I was a pretty normal kid until my teenage years, then I dyed my hair pink and spiralled out of control.\" The reason for her rebellion was one Kurt Cobain. \"I fell in love with the Kurt and Courtney story, even though I was only 12,\" she says. \" I had all the posters on my bedroom wall - the   where he has loads of eyeliner. I was fascinated by grunge and it started there.  \"Growing up so safe, I think I was looking for something else.\" Although she's switched allegiance from grunge to pop, her use of dynamics (quiet verses, thunderous choruses) is still indebted to the Nirvana template. \"I'm a lot more inspired by that stuff than I think,\" she says. \"I like the music to be more direct - that's part of my way of writing without realising it.\" No wonder, then, that the Truth Serum EP - which contains more hooks than a coat rack - has made people sit up and listen. But the singer insists she never intended to become famous. \"If I wanted that, then I would have gone on Idol (Sweden's Pop Idol) - and I got the offer so many times,\" she says.  \"There's easy ways to get famous today if you want to. I had lots of meetings in the States, and they were saying, 'an artist is a business, we're going to turn you into an Empire!'  \"They would ask questions like, 'what would you wear to the red carpet?' and I would go 'I don't give a crap about the red carpet! Who cares?'\" Tove looks up to Beyonce - \"she never makes a mistake, she's not flawed vocally, physically\" - but sees her own career taking a different path. \"I'm a bit more rough around the edges. I couldn't release a fragrance - I don't even wear perfume - but obviously I'd like to have her audience!\" That day could come soon: Several magazines have anointed her a \"pop star in waiting\", and the singer is hard at work on her debut album.  \"I feel I have the songs,\" she says. \"That's what I love doing, so it doesn't scare me.  \"But I want the album to have the kind of storyline that Truth Serum has - so it feels connected, not a bunch of songs put together. It all depends how long that takes me.\" If that album makes her a star, and if she's very, very lucky, British DJs will finally learn how to say her name.  For the record, it's pronounced \" \" but Tove doesn't mind if people approach it phonetically. \"It's a Scandinavian name, so no-one's ever going to say it right in English,\" she laughs. \"And also,  sounds a bit like 'to the loo' which is not so good. So Tove Lo is alright.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26954021", "title": ["Tove Lo: A Swedish pop star in waiting"]},
{"article": "As the Olivier Awards-nominated Handbagged opens in the West End and Red Velvet storms New York, is this a golden period for London's Tricycle Theatre? Backstage at the Vaudeville Theatre on the Strand, Indhu Rubasingham is still catching her breath after a whirlwind week. The artistic director of the Tricycle Theatre is just back from New York, where her production of Red Velvet has opened to glowing reviews.  Now she is putting the finishing touches to her production of Moira Buffini's new play Handbagged, which sold out at the Tricycle last year and is now making a leap into the West End. If you personally judge yourself by awards then you're going to nowhere\u201d The play, which imagines the meetings between the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, is also a nominee at this Sunday's Olivier Awards, where it is up for outstanding achievement in affiliate theatre. Red Velvet was nominated in the same category last year. \"It's a great time for the Tricycle,\" says Rubasingham, who took over as artistic director in May 2012 after Nicolas Kent's 28 years at the helm.  \"If you personally judge yourself by awards then you're going to nowhere. Where these things help is on marketing, audiences, fundraising and profile.\"  The play's transition from the 200-seat theatre in Kilburn to the 700-seater Vaudeville has, she says, involved \"quite a bit of editing and tightening\".  Handbagged started life as a 20-minute piece in 2010. Plans to expand it were almost abandoned when it was announced that Peter Morgan's The Audience would open in the West End in 2013.  That play, starring Helen Mirren as the Queen, imagined the private meetings between the monarch and her prime ministers over her 60-year reign. \"In the end we thought it didn't matter,\" explains Rubasingham. \"They're actually very different stories.\"  As it turned out, Margaret Thatcher died three days before Buffini was due to start work on the full-length play. \"People thought we were really quick off the mark but it was always going to happen.\"  Handbagged's big theatrical idea is to double up the main roles.  Hence there are younger and older versions of the Queen (played by Lucy Robinson and Marion Bailey, respectively) and Margaret Thatcher (Fenella Woolgar and Stella Gonet).  Rubasingham says having both versions of each character on stage at the same time brought its own challenges for her as director. \"One may start a thought and the other one may finish it - it wasn't naturalism, it was pure theatre.  I felt like the play was stretching me, rather than me trying to make it work.\"  Both she and Buffini were \"Thatcher children\". Rubasingham recalls growing up in Mansfield, near Nottingham, during the miners' strikes.  \"When Moira was writing it we would talk a lot about our experiences. You realise how things that started at the time are the catalysts of what's happening now.  \"I wasn't a Thatcher fan growing up. Now it's not that I agree with her, but I've understood her a bit more, and I really admire that someone in that time, as a woman, had that kind of conviction politics, whether or not you agree with those politics.\" Rubasingham says the opening of Red Velvet in New York earlier this month was an \"emotional\" moment. She and playwright Lolita Chakrabarti first began talking about bringing the story to the stage eight years ago.   Starring Chakrabarti's husband Adrian Lester, Red Velvet tells the story of pioneering African-American actor Ira Aldridge, who caused a sensation in London in 1833 when he took over the role of Othello after famous actor Edmund Kean collapsed on stage. The play was Rubasingham's first project when she took over at the Tricycle. Almost two years on, it's now creating waves across the Atlantic.  \"It's been a huge journey, there were times when both of us thought this was never going to happen. Very rarely do those moments crystallise into something like this.\" She adds excitedly that Robert Redford had already been to see it. \"How has this happened after all that time when people were shutting the doors on it?\"  She thinks the script has film potential, and predicts the play will have a long life even after Lester has stepped down from the lead role. What kind of impact does a New York run and a West End transfer - Rubasingham's first from the Tricycle - have on the Kilburn theatre's finances? \"I don't know yet. The show in New York is not going to bring money to the Tricycle but it hasn't cost us money - but it raises the profile.  \"With Handbagged it's early days. If it sells and we more than break even, then money will come to the Tricycle.\"  Rubasingham sees investment as a key issue in theatre. \"The theatre community has got to communicate to society why it's important. The work we've done with Handbagged and Red Velvet has only come from Arts Council investment. I can take those risks.   \"In New York people say they don't see work like that because there isn't that investment. \"As a country we've got to put that investment in the arts because its our moral compass, it's our social conscience. It's our spiritual well-being as a society.  \"It's not just about luvvies having fun.\"  ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26968652", "title": ["Handbagged puts Queen and Margaret Thatcher back on stage"]},
{"article": "Mancunian illustrator Stan Chow's cartoon portraits of famous faces has won him worldwide fame. Now a major retrospective is being held of his 20-year career at a gallery in his home town. Stan Chow's artwork is, by his own admission, about \"simple geometric shapes, flat colour and sweeping curves\". Two decades on from his first forays, it is a simplicity that has seen him garner fans and commissions worldwide. While his work has covered a wide variety of topics, it is his portraits of famous faces that he has become known for and the striking images have graced magazines, books and posters across the world. He says that while the portraits might look simple, it is \"pot luck\" as to how long each work will take. \"Sometimes it can take a few minutes, sometimes it can take hours. \"My favourite ones are the ones where I can nail the likeness pretty quickly and be as economical as possible, like my Bruce Willis silhouette and the Woody Allen.\" He says entertaining people with his style began, as things so often do, in the pub. \"Back in the day, I used to go drinking with [Elbow's] Guy Garvey a lot. Just to entertain myself and the people around us, I'd do a sketch of Guy using literally four or five strokes. \"It wasn't super-flattering, but it did look like him and it was striking - and he would usually do an impression of me which would entertain him greatly.\" Some faces have not been as easy to capture. He says one in particular caused him problems - that of Britney Spears. \"It was for the New Yorker magazine. They wanted an illustration of her post nose-job.  \"The problem with Britney is I don't recognise the post nose-job Britney as Britney.  \"The Britney I know is the one with the slightly weird nose, wearing a uniform in the Hit Baby One More Time video. \"The eventual illustration was given the thumbs up, but it messed with my head a little having to do that portrait.\" Now his achievement is being recognised with an exhibition at Manchester's Centre for Contemporary Chinese Art. He says he is delighted to put on the show but admits that it was \"never a conscious decision for my style to be how it is\". \"The more you illustrate, paint and draw, the more you evolve into the artist you become. \"I also realised when becoming a professional illustrator that there were some clients who would give you impossible deadlines to work to, like a call at 5pm for a print deadline the next morning. \"You have to learn how to work fast, so I guess my style has been streamlined somewhat to suit clients.\" The streamlining took \"about seven or eight years to fine tune\" - time in which he says he \"learnt to become economical and speedy\". \"There's a phrase in cookery - 'minimum effort, maximum impact'. It's slowly becoming my mantra.  \"Ultimately I do like to finish an illustration in less than a day - for me there's nothing more frustrating than going to sleep with an unfinished work to wake up to.\" It is not the only subject to cause him concern. Another has been much closer to home, his self-portrait. \"The problem now with doing a self portrait that looks like me is that I have to illustrate myself with a round face.  \"I actually do have a round face [but] it disappoints me that I have a round face nowadays. I much prefer my portraits when I was younger and my face was slightly slimmer.\" How he got that round face could be revealed in the retrospective, titled The Takeaway, which he says tells \"the story of my life, where I grew up to where I am today\". \"I grew up in a chip shop - the reason why I am an illustrator is because growing up, the only form of amusement I had was with a biro and chip paper.  \"I didn't really have many toys when I was a nipper, all I did was draw and draw and draw.\" He says the shop gave him his \"first big break\" while he was working there after art school. \"One evening, whilst a customer was waiting for his sweet and sour chicken, I started doodling on the paper. \"He seemed unnervingly interested in my doodles and we struck up a conversation. \"He told me he was an art director at an ad agency - anyway it's a long story, but it's the first chapter of how I got to where I am today.\" The rest, as they say, is history.

{"article": "Roger Deakins is the director of photography on films such as The Shawshank Redemption, A Beautiful Mind, No Country for Old Men, True Grit and Skyfall, the most successful British film ever.  He's won more than 60 awards for his work, including three Baftas, and was last year presented with a lifetime achievement award by the American Society of Cinematographers. When he isn't working, he spends his time living in LA, but his heart belongs to Devon, where he was born. \"I miss it every day,\" he says. Here are his top ten tips for becoming a successful cinematographer. A cinematographer visualises the film and is a director's right hand on set. I studied photography and then went to the National Film School in England and got into the business that way, but there are all kinds of ways of getting in.  I think it is more important to experience the world, really. You can't learn cinematography and you can't copy it. The job is just your way of looking at the world. Maybe that sounds a bit pretentious, but I think life experience is always more important than technical knowledge.  I'm picky about the sort of material I want to work with, always have been. But usually I'm drawn to scripts that are about characters, I don't have a love of doing action movies.  It is really important to choose which projects you are going to work on carefully. You are going to be on a film for a long time. I've just come back from Australia working on Unbroken with Angelina Jolie, which she was directing.  It's six months of time and investment, but very worthwhile. I enjoyed it completely, but it was a hard shoot. You work long hours, often you're working six days a week and you are away from home. There are certain kinds of sacrifices you have to make. My relationship with the Coen brothers goes back a long time. We just sort of hit it off and we're good friends, so I'd do anything with them. I loved working Sam Mendes on Skyfall, I probably wouldn't have done a Bond movie with anybody else. He had a different take on it and I think that film was far more character driven and that's what drew me to it.  I turned down working on the next Bond film. I was really torn. I would have loved to work with Sam again but I just didn't feel I could bring anything really new to it. I'd really like to see someone else have the opportunity. My wife James travels with me when I'm working on a film. We've been married for over 20 years and she has been incredibly important to my career. We always talk about what projects are coming up and make the decisions together.  We like the same kind of movies, we rarely disagree, we just talk things through. Deciding which projects to work on is something that you spend quite a long time considering. I'm very lucky to be in a position that means I can be a bit choosy these days. It's no use just thinking you can just learn how to light and copy the best. We all find our own ways of doing things and our own sense of lens choice, composition and the way you move the camera. You can tell one person's work from another quite often, you know. So I think it's important to develop as a person. You have to develop your way of being. Otherwise, what are you doing? It's no good just copying, learning a technique and doing it. That's not very interesting, apart from anything else. I remember a fellow cinematographer talking about Shawshank and saying, \"Well that was really nicely shot but there was no lighting in it.\"  We actually shot most of the film in a prison that was absolutely black - I used a huge amount of light to create the look, more or less every shot, even some of the exteriors were lit! So it was a reverse compliment really, because there was a major cinematographer thinking it was shot with natural light when it wasn't!  So, on the one hand, you need to light a space so you can see the actors - but, more than that, you are creating a mood, you are creating a world for those actors to inhabit and for the audience to get submersed in. Lighting is one of the most important aspects of any great film.  When you are on a film, because it takes so much time and you are often doing a 12, 14, 16 or even 18-hour day, you're often tired and so sometimes the temptation can be to do something a bit quick and cut corners, but then you regret it.  Any time that you do something and think, \"Oh well, that will be alright even if it's not as good as I can do,\" you always regret it later. If anything stands out as being untrue within the terms of that movie, then the audience's experience of that world is jolted, they are taken out of it. What you do lives on forever, as they say. It's important to persevere, because it's the people who persevere who go on to create something unique. You have to keep up with new technology, it all changes rapidly. Film stocks change, techniques like steadycam come along, we've got cranes now and aerial helicopters that can do all sorts of things and gyromounts so you can move the camera in all sorts of ways. We have digital technology now and 3D has come back.  Technology is changing all the time, but for me nothing has changed in the sense that you are still telling stories by the use of light, the use of a frame, the way you move a camera. I'm still hoping to be part of telling stories about people and the way we are. So, to me, technology is important, but it's only in the background, it's a means to an end, it's like the paintbrush. I cut my own hair. My hairdresser died when I was eleven. He was a really nice man and I didn't have anyone else, so I started cutting my own. I know it sounds silly, but I really don't like people fussing, frankly. It's only hair.   I've got a really comfortable pair of cowboy boots and I wear blue jeans and a white shirt every day, including today. When I was working in England I wore a black shirt but now I'm in America, I wear a white one.  I've got 10 white shirts and three pairs of jeans so that when I get up in the morning, I don't have to think about what I am going to put on. I can be dressed and out the door in ten minutes. It's a silly thing but it's like I'm getting ready for work and putting on my uniform. I've been fired off a movie a couple of times and that's pretty horrendous. When something like that happens, you've just got to look at it and realise it's not necessarily about you. I haven't got a particularly thick skin, but it is important to be able to put things aside.  Some films were very hard and at times you kind of struggle and you are in conflict with other people to get the job done. But overall, I wouldn't have done anything else. I loved those experiences if only because at the end you actually feel satisfied that you've managed to create something. I don't know what's next. I'm hoping to get back with Joel and Ethan and do something with them, really. I love my life and my career so far and I think I've got plenty more to do.

{"article": "Sajid Javid, the Conservative MP for Bromsgrove, has been appointed culture secretary by David Cameron following the resignation of Maria Miller. Born in Rochdale in 1969, the 44-year-old former banker has been promoted from his previous role as Financial Secretary to the Treasury. A lot will be waiting for this bus driver's son at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). But what should be top of his list of priorities? The BBC News website asked the editors of four publications that focus on the arts and the creative industries what their readers want from him. I think what the UK film industry wants most from government is a sense of stability, particularly in the continuation of the  , which is an essential piece of the puzzle for keeping the British film industry surviving and thriving. What would be disastrous is if the new minister would make any sort of rash decision without consulting industry, the way Jeremy Hunt did in  . Now that the BFI is the  , they need to be allowed to just get on with the jobs at hand. Chris Smith's   and its follow-up review have laid out a clear plan of action. The hope is that any new minister will help the experts get on with that plan, not muddy the waters with their own input at this stage. It has to be said that culture minister Ed Vaizey has been a consistent and interested governmental voice about the film industry for a number of years. That's an asset for a new culture secretary, to have Vaizey's perspective after he's taken a genuine interest in understanding the industry.  But in short, the tax credit's stability, or even furthering it as recently proposed, is the most important thing that the culture secretary needs to protect. I think the vast majority of people in the music industry are pretty sick and tired of seeing music not regarded as one of the government's favoured creative industries. Video games, TV and the animation industry all recently won   in an announcement that was supposed to cover all the creative industries. Music once again was forgotten in that round. The industry has obviously been very hurt by copyright infringement over the past 15 years, particularly online. I think it's fair to say it would like to see action from government to assist with that. UK music as a net export is a huge success story for the UK and they would also like to see that reflected in policy making. I think it will be a huge relief if Sajid Javid acknowledged the music industry alongside the more tech-touched industries that have a sort of halo effect around them at the moment, from video games to animation to online programme making. There seems to be a belief within the current government that the UK tech industries are the only area for growth. But without content and without owning the rights to the things people want to be entertained by and engaged with, you don't have an industry. That's a message the music industry will want the culture secretary to be driving home at cabinet meetings. Music content is more widely listened to than ever before and the industry just wants to see it protected. We've seen Adele and Ed Sheeran and other artists emerge on the world stage in the last five years, so it would also be lovely to see if some sort of tax relief could help bring through the next era of British artists. In terms of theatre and the performing arts, I would say getting the   that's coming in later this year right and making sure the details are ironed out and making sure it's the one that works best for the sector has got to be near the top of his list. The last budget announced a brand new tax relief for theatre investment along the lines of the film tax relief that already exists. It's a   so it won't be directly Sajid Javid's brief. But it is his sector that it's going to affect, so I would have thought he'll be involved in getting it put through. Another area that Maria Miller wasn't as active in as she could have been, was the role of the DCMS in encouraging local authorities to fund culture. If there's one big funding issue in the arts from a theatre point of view, it's local council funding. I don't think enough has been done to encourage local authorities to continue their support for the arts. The third thing is working with the Department of Education to ensure that funding levels at arts training institutions are retained as much as possible, because a lot of drama schools are feeling the pinch at the moment. Hopefully the new culture secretary can bring some knowledge of how the Treasury works into the arts sector, to help it make a better case for funding and make the argument in a way the Treasury understands. The first thing is it's important to appear interested. It's important to be seen at things, to go and visit things and get to know the art world. And it's important not just to be seen at the National Gallery or the Tate, but to take some time to visit small arts organisations out in the regions. It helps a lot if the impression is that the culture secretary is genuinely interested - that always wins friends. Number two is obviously the issues around funding. The Conservative Party has increasingly started talking the language of art and the economy; they seem to see it very much from the economic aspect. Now art does have an  , but I think people feel in our world that arts offer more than economic value. Museums, art exhibitions, cultural events have a social benefit, an educational benefit, and I think it would be good for the secretary to understand that. Abroad, this is what we're known for. People like Thomas Heatherwick, Jonathan Ive, all the YBAs [Young British Artists] - people know who they are. Abroad, our art output is seen as a very important thing. But those people nearly all grew up at a time when art school was relatively cheap to go to and it was less of a risk. Becoming a really good artist is a long slow and painful process and it would be good for that to be understood. That's something the art world in the UK feels has got lost in the mix. I think we want a culture secretary who would be looking to protect the Arts Council and museums from any other cuts, and who really understands the educational and social benefit of the arts, from school to museum-visiting as an adult. There's also the issue around smaller arts organisations that tend to get funded through local authority budgets. There have been cuts at the local authority level that have affected arts in the region quite badly, and there's a general feeling that the regions have slid down the priority list. The minister could also do his best to persuade the Treasury to make it more attractive for the very wealthy to donate money and art, and not just to big institutions like the Tate.

{"article": "Welsh director Gareth Evans reveals why he chose to make a follow-up to The Raid, the low-budget martial arts thriller that became an international hit in 2011. Indonesian film The Raid cost around $1 million (\u00a3596,000) to make but made 15 times that sum at the worldwide box office in 2011. Described by some film critics as \"the best action film of all time\", its visceral martial arts scenes and large body count made it a cult classic with fans. Now The Raid 2 arrives in UK cinemas, four months on from its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Its maker is 34-year-old Gareth Evans, originally from Hirwaun in south Wales, who now lives in Indonesia.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Gareth Evans talks to BBC Wales Today about his career and films According to Evans, the first film's plot was \"pretty simple, because we had no budget. A policeman, Rama, has to fight his way to the top of a gang-controlled building without dying himself.\" In contrast, The Raid 2 \"has far more of a story [that] expands the criminal world of the first film\". \"If the audience are willing to follow us into it,\" Evans continues, \"it will have a very different feel to the first one.\" The Raid became the most successful Indonesian film release of all time, prompting international interest in Pencak Silat, the local martial art it featured, and making a star of Iko Uwais, the stuntman-actor who plays Rama.  Evans and Uwais had worked together before on Merentau, a cult martial arts hit in Indonesia. The international reaction to The Raid, though, took both by surprise. \"I never expected it,\" admits Evans. \"And at first it felt like there was a certain amount of novelty publicity around it. A Welshman has made this Indonesian martial arts movie, there's a thing! \"What it has done is given both myself and Iko a certain amount of career security. I certainly had offers to make other films after it came out, but nothing compared to the prospect of making the sequel. I was passionately committed to it.\" Now signed to the prestigious William Morris talent agency in the US, Evans is also serving as a producer on a Hollywood remake of The Raid. The film will be made by The Expendables 3 director Patrick Hughes, with   suggesting Australian actor Chris Hemsworth or his brother Liam will take the lead role. \"I know that it's inevitable that a great foreign language movie will be made and Hollywood will want to remake it,\" sighs Evans. \"Just like The Ring or Let the Right One In, fans will look at it and say 'why on earth is it getting remade? The only thing that's any different is there are no subtitles.' \"But the way I see it is that some kid who listens to Justin Bieber will probably go and see the Hollywood version of The Raid, and then he might discover the foreign originals that I've made. \"Once he's seen these films, I doubt he'll like Justin Bieber any more. In that way, I'll have done some good in the world.\" The Raid 2 picks up a couple of hours from where the first film ended, with Rama - having just disposed of hundreds of criminals - being asked to go undercover in prison. Those who loved the first story for its non-stop martial arts sequences may be disappointed that the new film, at two-and-a-half hours and with five times the budget, has more dialogue and conversation pieces in the criminal underworld where it is set. \"I don't think I've made a big, bloated film with the budget I've had,\" Evans counters. \"In fact, every penny is on screen again. \"I hope fans will like it because this is the film I originally wrote, when I wanted to make the first Raid, but we simply didn't have the money. \"I was a frustrated director, simply desperate to make a film, and so I rewrote it to be set around one building, which was considerably cheaper than multiple locations. \"This still has all the blood and guts of the first; I think there might be more actually. I hope it's still a visceral spectacle. \"The Raid 2 is very violent. I appreciate some people won't like that, but you have to remember we are following a film tradition of Indonesian martial arts films. I want to have made something edgy.\" Uwais and Evans are now local heroes in Indonesia, where they are credited for bringing back a martial art movie tradition that, according to the director, \"died off in the 1970s\". Despite this, the Welshman reveals his next two directing jobs will be in the UK and the US.  \"Everything is working really, really well for me right now,\" he says. \"Just being able to make a film is a dream come true.\" Raid fans need not fret, though. Evans is open that the series was designed as a trilogy and has pledged will return to direct the final instalment.  \"I've already planned it out - it's definitely going to happen,\" he insists. \"There's going to be no rest for the characters at the end of this film.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26910069", "title": ["Welsh director Gareth Evans returns with Indonesian action sequel"]},

Judah's twin sculptures have been installed in the nave of St Paul's Cathedral in London and were created to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of World War One. But in an attempt to bring the memorials up to date, Judah has stuck war ravaged townscapes, reminiscent of scenes from Syria and Afghanistan, on the 20-ft-tall (6m) cruciforms. And those in charge of the cathedral have been thrilled with the end result. The Reverend Canon Mark Oakley said the sculptures \"provoke us into interrogating the present world and the landscapes we casually view on the news every day.\" BBC News was given a tour of the artist's studio and a sneak preview of the structures, before they are officially unveiled on Palm Sunday, 13 April.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. David Sillito looks back at the life of Sue Townsend Sue Townsend failed her 11 plus, left school at 15 and wrote in secret, but she went on to become one of the UK's best-selling and beloved authors.  Susan Lillian Townsend was born in Leicester in 1946, the city where she set her most famous work, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4. The story of the pimply, pretentious teenager who painted his room black and obsessed about a girl called Pandora sold two million copies when it was released at the end of 1982.  Adored by fellow teenagers and adults alike, the book was followed by The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole in 1984 - making Townsend the best-selling novelist of the 1980s.  Townsend said she grew up \"comic-poor - what the Americans now call trailer-trash\", as the eldest of three daughters.  But there were always books in their home and, after discovering children's classics, she was soon reading one a day. \"I do think that books, good books, free you,\" she told writer Alan Clark, a friend and former creative writing student who interviewed her for Mediterranean Life magazine.  \"They make you feel a citizen of the world and things like class, sex and age don't matter. They're the greatest leveller.\" After leaving school, she worked as a petrol pump attendant, shop assistant and factory hand, before training as a community worker. She married at 18 but hid her writing from her first husband, inside sofa cushions and under the stairs. He left her and she was soon juggling three jobs, writing at night while her three children were asleep.  \"I became an insomniac, really, hardly slept at all, didn't even try to,\" she told The Guardian  .  \"And it's carried on. I hate to say I only need as much sleep as Mrs Thatcher, but I can cope really well on five hours.\" It was not until she confessed all to her partner Colin Broadway - who she later married and had another child with - that she was encouraged to join a local writers' group at the Phoenix Theatre in Leicester, winning an award for her first play.  The Adrian Mole series first started life as a play on BBC Radio 4 - first broadcast with the title The Diary of Nigel Mole, Aged 13 1/4.   A publisher heard it and offered her a contract to turn it into a book. A name change and another seven instalments followed along with TV and theatre adaptations.  Townsend often said she identified with Adrian but she was amazed by the book's success, both in the UK and abroad.  \"Now I realise that Adrian is simply a type of person who exists everywhere, regardless of nationality,\" she told Clark.  \"Shy, thoughtful, oversensitive, repressed. In a hut in the Gambia at this moment, there's an Adrian Mole getting on people's tits.\" She never allowed any of the books to carry an illustration of Mole though, as she wanted people to be able to visualise the character for themselves. Townsend had a heart attack when she was just 40 and was registered blind in 2001, after a 15-year battle with diabetes. She would lie on a sofa, dictating her final books to her writer son Sean, who - in 2009, donated one of his kidneys to his mother.  \"It makes me sound like Barbara Cartland. But I'm never as well groomed as she was,\"   in March 2012. During a BBC interview later that month, at the new Mansfield Library where she was speaking to a visually-impaired reading group, Townsend said of losing her sight: \"You can't underestimate what a devastating blow it is.\" She added: \"People would say, 'You're so good about it.' But inside... to me not being able to read, I still haven't come to terms with it yet.\" She also had neuropathic arthropathy - Charcot's joint -  which weakened the bones in her legs and feet and meant she had to use a wheelchair.  Before she lost her sight completely, Townsend would carry a large magnifying glass, which Stephen Mangan - who played Adrian in the BBC adaptation of The Cappuccino Years - remembers being trained on him.  \"When I auditioned to play Adrian, I remember she told me that he couldn't be too good looking,\" he said.  \"She pulled out a magnifying glass, came up right to my face - because her sight was just in the last stages of going, scanned me all over and said that I was indeed 'not good-looking enough to play the part'.  \"She was very funny, there was a lot of laughter whenever you met Sue,\" added Mangan.   Media requires JavaScript to play. Adrian Mole author Sue Townsend reveals she still has not come to terms with losing her eyesight through diabetes. The Cappuccino Years was a satire on New Labour, with Pandora now an MP and Adrian a chef in London.  Townsend was a passionate socialist and politics also influenced Adrian Mole's teenage years, under Thatcher's government. The eighth Mole instalment, Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years, was published in 2009.  However, Townsend suffered a stroke over Christmas 2012 and, at the Oxford Literary Festival a few months later, revealed she had to push back the release date of the ninth book as a result.  \"It was on the way until the stroke interrupted me,\" she said.  Her other best-selling novels include The Queen and I - about the Royal Family being forced to move to a council estate after a revolution - and 2012's The Woman Who Went to Bed for a Year, about a middle aged mum who refuses to get up from bed.  \"Oh I'd love to [do that],\" Townsend told The Big Issue. \"A month would be great. Just getting up now and again, you know, to take showers and stuff. I wouldn't get bored, I'd listen to the radio.\" Townsend also published a more serious novel, Ghost Children, about the life-long effects of having an abortion, based on her own experiences - and often talked about writing \"a masterpiece\".  \"I wanted to be Dostoevsky but my way of coping with the world has always been humour,\" she told Clark.  \"In the playground I always made people laugh, I used to charge them three pence for an impression of a teacher. It kept me in toffees.\" Writers and comedians including JK Rowling, David Walliams, Matt Lucas and Caitlin Moran were all quick to pay tribute to that humour on Twitter.  Having left school at 15, Townsend was awarded an honorary Masters of Arts from Leicester University and, in 2008, was made a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the university. She was also an Honorary Doctor of Letters at Loughborough University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. \"I hate it when people call me a 'national treasure',\"   in 2010, while promoting The Prostrate Years.  \"It takes away your bite and makes you feel like a harmless old golden Labrador.\" In 2009, Townsend was given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester.  She was surrounded by her family when she died at her home in the city on 10 April, following a short illness.
