[{"article": "Pop singer Kylie Minogue has quit The Voice after one series. The 45-year-old joined the BBC talent show last year, replacing Jessie J, and was credited with boosting viewing figures during the first few episodes. However, she said touring commitments meant she would be unable to return for a second series. \"Due to timing of my tour I won't be back next season for The Voice UK,\" she  . \"Thanks to all who supported!\" \"I absolutely loved my time on the show, and I'll miss all of the incredible people who were a part of my experience,\" the singer said. Jermain Jackman was crowned the winner of this year's series, marking the first victory for mentor will.i.am. Minogue's candidate in the final, Jamie Johnson, was eliminated in the first round of phone voting. Although the third series of the talent show enjoyed a ratings spike during the audition stages, peaking with 9.41m viewers, the live final was the least successful yet. An average audience of 6.6 million tuned in for the show, down from 7.24 million in 2012, and 7.1 million people the year before. The BBC has already commissioned another two series of The Voice.  Moira Ross, executive producer at production company Wall To Wall, said: \"Kylie has brought her own very special magic to The Voice UK and we have loved having her on the show.  \"We wish her well for her tour and hope to welcome her back in the future.\" It has not yet been confirmed whether Minogue's fellow panellists Tom Jones, Ricky Wilson and will.i.am will return for the fourth series next year.

{"article": "Five musicians have taken legal action against the National Theatre after being stripped of their roles in the West End production of War Horse. The musicians are seeking a High Court injunction to be allowed back into the show until the full case can be heard.  The High Court heard the National Theatre had opted to use pre-recorded music instead of live performers. The group said they had continued to show up for nightly performances only to be turned away. The five, who had been with the hit show since 2009, had their roles cut back in March 2013 to just a few minutes per performance, until live music was cut altogether in March this year. Lawyers for the five -  Neyire Ashworth, Andrew Callard, Jonathan Eddie, David Holt and Colin Rae - told the court they were given 11 days notice of the contract termination but had continued to arrive on time for daily shows. \"The claimants have not accepted this breach of their contracts, and have elected to affirm their contracts. They have at all times made it clear that they remain willing and able to attend work and to perform their obligations under their contracts,\" said James Laddie QC. The National Theatre contests that it was bringing the London production in line with War Horse stage shows around the world, which do not use live music.  Representing the National Theatre, David Reade QC said the theatre was entitled to terminate the contracts of anyone whose services were no longer required.  He told the judge - who admitted he had not seen the show - that War Horse was a play which featured music rather than a full-blown musical.  \"As such, the orchestra was not an integral part of the play, and indeed there is no live band in any other production around the world,\" said Mr Reade. He added that it was \"frankly naive\" to think the musicians could return to their previous roles, and that a new cast had spent seven weeks rehearsing without live music. He said the National was not questioning the ability of the musicians but theatre management believed its live music budget would be better used elsewhere.  Judge Mr Justice Cranston said he would deliver his ruling on 15 April. War Horse is one of the National Theatre's most successful productions during the tenure of outgoing artistic director Sir Nicholas Hytner, having been seen by more than 2.5m people worldwide.

It was just like an email, and I emailed them back and said, 'yeah, great!'\" In a statement, she added she had \"worked with some brilliant people over the years\" and had been \"very fortunate to have had the opportunities to work on such a variety of projects\". Walters, who was made a CBE in 2008, originally trained as a nurse before studying English and drama and going to work for the Everyman Theatre Group in Liverpool, where her contemporaries included Bill Nighy and writer Alan Bleasdale. She played various minor roles before teaming up on TV with Woods, with whom she had previously appeared on stage. She gained international stardom with the comedy film Educating Rita, playing a working class woman who turns to academia to try and better her life.

DJ Steve Lamacq revealed the   as part of a week-long celebration to mark the 20th birthday of Britpop. More than 30,000 people voted, with The Verve's Bittersweet Symphony second and Oasis tracks Don't Look Back in Anger and Wonderwall in third and fourth.

Included in Pulp's Different Class album, it featured Sadie Frost in the video and the lyrics were based on a girl who singer Jarvis Cocker met while studying at Central Saint Martin's art college. The lyrics reveal the girl from a wealthy family, had told him she wanted to live in the East End of London with \"the common people\".  \"It is one of the defining records of Britpop because it seemed to embrace the essence of the time so perfectly,\" said Lamacq, who led the Britpop at the BBC celebrations along with former co-presenter Jo Whiley. \"It was a big, bold anthem, but with a great narrative. And it seemed to sum up a feeling of 'us and them', as if to illustrate how the indie mavericks had taken on the pop stars and - for once - they'd won.\" Pulp also featured at number nine in the countdown with Disco 2000, while Suede hit Animal Nitrate was in sixth place and Blur's Girls and Boys in seventh.   Listeners were asked to vote for their all-time favourite Britpop anthem - the one song that epitomised that time for them.

{"article": "Making films that specifically target older people is \"a mistake\", according to Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson.  Many studios have tried to capitalise on the success of films like Calendar Girls and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, both of which had older casts. But Thompson told BBC Radio 4's   that separating audiences into groups was \"a mistake culturally, artistically and economically.\" The actress appeared on the show to promote her new film, The Love Punch.  The film, which co-stars Pierce Brosnan and Celia Imrie, has a slightly older cast than a typical Hollywood blockbuster, but Thompson said it aimed \"to entertain everybody\". \"This film isn't for older people, that would be a tragic mistake to indicate that we were making this for older people,\" she said.  \"What I find really fantastic about it is that it's young people who seem to enjoy it just as much, if not more.\" Thompson continued: \"I don't see where age has to come into it - it's been made to entertain everybody in the groups that we're supposed to be in, which is a selection of ages. \"The fact is that the film industry has tried to separate us into groups, and it's a mistake culturally, artistically and economically.\"  The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which starred Dame Judi Dench, Dame Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy as British pensioners at a retirement hotel in India, took $134m (\u00a383m) worldwide in 2012.  It was a huge return on an estimated $10m (\u00a36.2m) budget and a sequel is currently being filmed. Titles such as Last Vegas, Quartet and A Song for Marion have followed in its wake.  They are said to be targeting the \"grey pound\" - targeting the ageing population, who can often visit the cinema during the quieter daytime periods. \"I long for the day where we don't have to talk about our age as actresses,\" said Imrie, pointing out that her character's age in The Love Punch was \"incidental\" to the plot.  \"I don't want us to have to bang on about it anymore, because the more actresses go on the more interesting and fascinating they are,\" Imrie told Front Row.  \"You look into an older woman's face and there's a whole lifetime of life, and that's what we're depicting.  \"It's very rare that we're ever asked to play actresses, we're asked to play people in life and therefore the more life you live the richer, hopefully, you can be.\"  Thompson told presenter John Wilson that women have to fight for roles as they get older: \"Not only fighting for the roles, but fighting for female rights in general.\" \"For women a lot of the time, the only power that they do have in their roles on screen is the sexual power,\" Thompson added.  \"So when that sexuality becomes older, and therefore a great deal more threatening, the roles dry up - because women don't have access to the kinds of power that create the kind of story that people are writing about. \"The roles of women in life - in political life, business life, everything - are absolutely mirrored by what we see in cinema.\" Thompson was last seen on screen as Mary Poppins creator PL Travers in Saving Mr Banks and recently filmed Jason Reitman's Men, Women and Children.  She said it was important to \"challenge yourself\" by taking on different kinds of roles. \"I think it was after Sense and Sensibility my Mum said, 'So what are you going to do next, are you going to play another good woman in a frock?'. And I thought, 'Bloody hell, thanks Mum.' But I know what she meant.\" Thompson continued: \"If you challenge yourself to do something different, I think the more experience you have the more interesting it is to meet that challenge, and sometimes really surprising things come out of it.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26971676", "title": ["Emma Thompson criticises 'grey pound' films for older audiences"]},

The first of her comic series, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4, was published in 1982 and the eighth instalment, Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years, was released in 2009. Her other best-selling novels included The Queen and I.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Townsend, who was left blind after suffering from diabetes for many years, achieved worldwide success following the publication of the books about teenager Adrian Mole. The series followed the main character from adolescence under Margaret Thatcher's government, to maturity in Tony Blair's Britain. Townsend said that, in many respects, her hero mirrored her own experience. In March 2013, she told the Oxford Literary Festival that publication of the next Adrian Mole book had been pushed back as a result of a stroke she had suffered. She was diagnosed with diabetes in the 1980s and underwent a kidney transplant in 2009. She had the stroke in December 2012. Comedian and writer Danny Wallace is one of a number of those who have paid tribute to Townsend. Wallace told the BBC: \"If ever I saw that she was in a town close to me - and I'd never been to book readings or book signings before - but I always made sure I went to hers. \"She was incredibly sweet to her younger fans and I've got all these books at home that she had signed and she would say, 'To Daniel, from Sue Townsend aged 43 and three quarters' or '45 and a half'. \"So she really understood what people loved about Adrian Mole I think.\"  Media requires JavaScript to play. Actor Stephen Mangan, who played Adrian Mole in a 2001 television adaptation, told Radio 4's Today programme that Townsend took him \"under her wing\" during filming.  \"There was something really special about Sue. She was a hero of mine when I read the books as an adolescent - I was pretty much the same age as Adrian - but when I met her I just fell in love with her really,\" he said.  \"She was warm, she was funny, she was self-deprecating. She was incredibly encouraging.  \"It was the first time I'd ever played a lead part in a series and, however confident I must have tried to appear, she instinctively knew how difficult it was for me to come and lead a company with people like Alison Steadman and Zoe Wanamaker and Helen Baxendale. I'll miss her a lot.\" Harry Potter author JK Rowling  , writing \"So sad to hear about Sue Townsend. She gave me so many laughs.\" She added: \"#AdrianMoleWillLiveForever.\" David Walliams also  on the social networking site, calling Townsend \"a comedy genius\" and \"lovely lady\" who wrote \"some of the funniest books of all time\".  Crime writer Ian Rankin described her death as \"a real loss\". Writer Caitlin Moran   Townsend was \"one of the funniest women who ever lived.\" Townsend was born in Leicester in 1946, and set her most famous work in her home city. The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4, was followed by The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole in 1984. The two books made her the best-selling novelist of the 1980s and they were followed by others in the Mole series, including The True Confessions of Adrian Albert Mole. Several of her books were adapted for the stage, while the Mole series was adapted for radio, television and theatre. Townsend was awarded an honorary Masters of Arts from Leicester University and in 2008 was made a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the university. She was also an Honorary Doctor of Letters at Loughborough University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 2009 Townsend was given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester.  She said at the time: \"I have been a citizen of Leicester for over 62 years, most of my family and friends live here, so I was delighted when I was nominated to receive the freedom of the city.\" She leaves her husband and four children.

Built by the Luton Model Railway Club, the diorama depicts the night in August 1963 when a gang of robbers stole \u00a32.6m from a night train in Buckinghamshire. Scenes depicted include bags of cash being unloaded from a carriage and the robbers making off with their swag.

They broke into the High Value Package coach and made off with 120 mailbags weighing about two and a half tonnes stuffed with \u00a32.6m in used banknotes (about \u00a341m in today's money).  The model railway enthusiasts were inspired by last year's 50th anniversary of the infamous raid, and it took them a year to complete their homage. Nigel Adams, from the club, said: \"We do not condone the actions of the event, but it is a fact that the Great Train Robbery has become a part of the national consciousness for many people over a certain age.  \"We have tried to portray this event in a sensitive way, taking due regard for the injuries sustained by the locomotive crew on the night.\" The diorama features sound and lighting effects \"to portray the account of the event\", said Mr Adams. \"There are 15 figures on the display, although we have taken care to present them as just that - figures on a model.  \"We do not identify any 'personalities' due to the sensitive nature of the subject.\" The historical reconstruction, which includes a commentary, will be on display at Stopsley High School, Luton on Saturday and at the National Festival of Railway Modelling in Peterborough in October.

Auctioneers expect great interest in the 1940s albums, and the paintings could fetch a six-figure sum at the annual Bonhams Scottish sale. A huge range of items including whisky, highland dress and Weymss pottery figures are also up for auction. The sale takes place at Bonhams Edinburgh saleroom on Queen Street over two days from 15 April. Highlights include a number of works by the Scottish Colourists, including three paintings by Francis Cadell. The two Broons albums were published in 1940 and 1942, while the Oor Wullie book dates from 1941. Produced by Dundee publisher DC Thomson, they were created by cartoonist Dudley Dexter Watkins, who drew the strips in his Broughty Ferry home until he died in 1969. Each of the three albums up for auction is valued at around \u00a33,000. Bonhams book specialist Henry Baggott said it was rare to find albums in such good condition as such books were usually heavily used by children. He said: \"They do turn up but the condition of them is generally very bad, covers dirty and pages missing. \"What is amazing about these is that they look like they have been untouched by human hands, least of all by children's hands.  \"I'm expecting lots of interest in them. They have appeared at auction in the past and sold very well.\" The paintings by Edinburgh-born Francis Cadell are expected to fetch high five-figure or even six-figure sums. Cadell was a leading member of the post-impressionist Scottish Colourist movement in the 1920s and 1930s which went on to have a key influence on contemporary Scottish art and culture. Two views of Iona are estimated at \u00a370,000 to \u00a3100,000 and \u00a360,000 to \u00a380,000, while another piece, Summer Garden, is valued between \u00a370,000 and \u00a390,000.

The Dylan Thomas Centre is being expanded so more treasures can be seen. It is all part of the celebrations marking the centenary of his birth.

The grant will also allow the Grade II-listed building to show significantly more than 950 artefacts while an education and multimedia audio and video suite will also be created. Thomas' granddaughter Hannah Ellis, who has played a key role in the project, said: \"The centre is home to the largest collection of Dylan Thomas-related material in the world, a collection that provides a unique insight into who my grandfather truly was.  \"I want young and new audiences to be able to learn about and discover my grandfather's poems, his stories and his plays.

The hour-long Symphony No 11: Memorial is based on music that Nyman was recording on the afternoon of the Hillsborough tragedy 25 years ago.  It will be performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. Local-born mezzo soprano Kathryn Rudge will sing the names of the 96 Liverpool football fans who lost their lives. They died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 and their families are currently appearing at fresh inquests into their deaths.  They are being held in Warrington after being ordered in December 2012, when the High Court quashed the original accidental death verdicts. Nyman said he hopes the work will make \"a small but significant contribution to the healing process still necessary for the families of the lost fans.\" The symphony will be performed at Liverpool Cathedral, with the orchestra and Rudge accompanied by the Liverpool Philharmonic Youth and Training Choirs, conducted by Josep Vicent. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said the city would \"never forget those who lost their lives at Hillsborough\".  \"Memorials are a symbol of our solidarity and support for the families, and Nyman's specially commissioned piece of music will be a moving and unforgettable tribute,\" said Anderson.  \"It is certain to be a highlight of this year's Biennial and a fantastic example of art being used to help shine a light on the dignity and bravery of those who have strived for justice for the 96,\" he added.  The symphony is inspired by Nyman's piece of music known as Memorial, a funeral march-style piece composed in 1985 - subsequently used in the film The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, starring Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren.   As a separate project for the Liverpool Biennial, Nyman will create a new film installation entitled Aztecs in Liverpool, including footage collected by Nyman over the past 20 years in his newly-adopted home of Mexico.

{"article": "The BBC was \"far too complacent\" in its handling of a failed IT project that cost licence fee payers \u00a398.4m.  The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was intended to move the BBC away from using and storing video tape. But it was scrapped, with almost no results, after five years of development.  After investigating the demise of the project,  has branded the programme \"a complete failure\". Chairman Margaret Hodge said the BBC needed to \"overhaul\" its approach to such projects, to \"safeguard licence fee payers' money\". The BBC originally approved DMI in 2006. It was supposed to produce new editing tools, an online archive of the BBC's programmes and a new database. Technology company Siemens was hired to develop the project in February 2008, and it was expected to be completed the following year. However, after a series of delays, the project was brought in-house, There it floundered until last May, when the BBC's incoming director general, Tony Hall, admitted it had \"wasted a huge amount of licence fee payers' money\". The gross estimate of the amount spent on DMI was \u00a3125.9m, although the BBC claims to have recouped \u00a327.5m of that. The BBC's technology chief, John Linwood, was sacked in July 2013 over the project's demise. A previous report, by the National Audit Office (NAO), blamed \"confusion and a lack of planning\" for the failure. It said that senior executives failed to take control of the project when it ran into trouble and \"did not appear to appreciate the extent of the problems until a late stage\". The PAC published its own findings on Thursday. It reiterated several of the points raised in earlier reports and criticised the BBC for its failure to alert MPs of the problems. \"When my committee examined the DMI's progress in February 2011, the BBC told us that the DMI was... absolutely essential... and that a lot of the BBC's future was tied up in the successful delivery of the DMI,\" said Ms Hodge. \"The BBC also told us that it was using the DMI to make many programmes and was on track to complete the system in 2011 with no further delays.  \"This turned out not to be the case. In reality the BBC only ever used the DMI to make one programme, called Bang Goes the Theory. \"The BBC was far too complacent about the high risks involved in taking it in-house. No single individual had overall responsibility or accountability for delivering the DMI and achieving the benefits, or took ownership of problems when they arose.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"Tony Hall was right to scrap the DMI project when he took over as director general last year. As we said at the time, the BBC didn't get DMI right and we apologised to licence fee payers.  \"Since then we have completely overhauled how these projects are delivered so that there is crystal clear accountability and transparency.\" A spokeswoman for the BBC Trust, the corporation's governing body, said: \"As we have said before, this represented an unacceptable loss to licence fee payers. \"Acting on the conclusions of previous reports into DMI, we have strengthened reporting to the Trust so that problems are spotted early and dealt with quickly.  \"We are also carrying out follow up reviews once projects are completed to make sure the lessons from DMI are being implemented.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26963723", "title": ["BBC was 'complacent' over failed \u00a3100m IT project"]},

But usually I'm drawn to scripts that are about characters, I don't have a love of doing action movies.  It is really important to choose which projects you are going to work on carefully. You are going to be on a film for a long time. I've just come back from Australia working on Unbroken with Angelina Jolie, which she was directing.  It's six months of time and investment, but very worthwhile. I enjoyed it completely, but it was a hard shoot. You work long hours, often you're working six days a week and you are away from home. There are certain kinds of sacrifices you have to make. My relationship with the Coen brothers goes back a long time. We just sort of hit it off and we're good friends, so I'd do anything with them. I loved working Sam Mendes on Skyfall, I probably wouldn't have done a Bond movie with anybody else. He had a different take on it and I think that film was far more character driven and that's what drew me to it.  I turned down working on the next Bond film. I was really torn. I would have loved to work with Sam again but I just didn't feel I could bring anything really new to it. I'd really like to see someone else have the opportunity. My wife James travels with me when I'm working on a film. We've been married for over 20 years and she has been incredibly important to my career. We always talk about what projects are coming up and make the decisions together.  We like the same kind of movies, we rarely disagree, we just talk things through. Deciding which projects to work on is something that you spend quite a long time considering. I'm very lucky to be in a position that means I can be a bit choosy these days. It's no use just thinking you can just learn how to light and copy the best. We all find our own ways of doing things and our own sense of lens choice, composition and the way you move the camera. You can tell one person's work from another quite often, you know. So I think it's important to develop as a person. You have to develop your way of being. Otherwise, what are you doing? It's no good just copying, learning a technique and doing it. That's not very interesting, apart from anything else. I remember a fellow cinematographer talking about Shawshank and saying, \"Well that was really nicely shot but there was no lighting in it.\"  We actually shot most of the film in a prison that was absolutely black - I used a huge amount of light to create the look, more or less every shot, even some of the exteriors were lit! So it was a reverse compliment really, because there was a major cinematographer thinking it was shot with natural light when it wasn't!  So, on the one hand, you need to light a space so you can see the actors - but, more than that, you are creating a mood, you are creating a world for those actors to inhabit and for the audience to get submersed in. Lighting is one of the most important aspects of any great film.  When you are on a film, because it takes so much time and you are often doing a 12, 14, 16 or even 18-hour day, you're often tired and so sometimes the temptation can be to do something a bit quick and cut corners, but then you regret it.  Any time that you do something and think, \"Oh well, that will be alright even if it's not as good as I can do,\" you always regret it later. If anything stands out as being untrue within the terms of that movie, then the audience's experience of that world is jolted, they are taken out of it. What you do lives on forever, as they say. It's important to persevere, because it's the people who persevere who go on to create something unique. You have to keep up with new technology, it all changes rapidly. Film stocks change, techniques like steadycam come along, we've got cranes now and aerial helicopters that can do all sorts of things and gyromounts so you can move the camera in all sorts of ways. We have digital technology now and 3D has come back.  Technology is changing all the time, but for me nothing has changed in the sense that you are still telling stories by the use of light, the use of a frame, the way you move a camera. I'm still hoping to be part of telling stories about people and the way we are. So, to me, technology is important, but it's only in the background, it's a means to an end, it's like the paintbrush. I cut my own hair. My hairdresser died when I was eleven. He was a really nice man and I didn't have anyone else, so I started cutting my own. I know it sounds silly, but I really don't like people fussing, frankly. It's only hair.   I've got a really comfortable pair of cowboy boots and I wear blue jeans and a white shirt every day, including today. When I was working in England I wore a black shirt but now I'm in America, I wear a white one.  I've got 10 white shirts and three pairs of jeans so that when I get up in the morning, I don't have to think about what I am going to put on. I can be dressed and out the door in ten minutes. It's a silly thing but it's like I'm getting ready for work and putting on my uniform. I've been fired off a movie a couple of times and that's pretty horrendous. When something like that happens, you've just got to look at it and realise it's not necessarily about you. I haven't got a particularly thick skin, but it is important to be able to put things aside.  Some films were very hard and at times you kind of struggle and you are in conflict with other people to get the job done. But overall, I wouldn't have done anything else. I loved those experiences if only because at the end you actually feel satisfied that you've managed to create something. I don't know what's next. I'm hoping to get back with Joel and Ethan and do something with them, really. I love my life and my career so far and I think I've got plenty more to do.

{"article": "The fate of Mickey Rooney's remains will be decided this week, following the Hollywood actor's death on Sunday. A judge in Los Angeles will decide on Friday whether the remains will be released to his estranged eighth wife or his lawyer, Michael Augustine. According to court documents, Rooney's most recent will, dated 11 March, left his modest estate to stepson Mark Aber. The actor had previously sued his other stepson, Christopher Aber, alleging elder abuse and fiscal mismanagement. Mark Aber - also known as Mark Rooney - and Christopher Aber are the sons of Janice Rooney, who Mickey Rooney married in 1978. The 93-year-old disinherited his wife and all his children in his last will, leaving his $18,000 (\u00a310,726) estate to Mark who had served, with his wife, as his caregiver. Michael Augustine was granted a court order on Tuesday preventing Janice Rooney from removing the actor's remains from a mortuary in Glendale, California. Rooney, a Hollywood legend whose film and musical career spanned nine decades, was no longer living with his wife at the time of his death from natural causes. The actor, loved by millions for his work in National Velvet and the Andy Hardy films, is survived by eight children as well as his two stepsons. He designated Augustine to serve as the executor of his estate, stating he did not want any of his relatives handling his affairs. In 2011, the actor testified before a US Senate committee that he had been emotionally and financially abused by family members. According to his lawyer, the actor owned a burial plot northwest of Los Angeles but had recently said he wanted to be buried in Hollywood or a veterans' cemetery.

{"article": "As the Olivier Awards-nominated Handbagged opens in the West End and Red Velvet storms New York, is this a golden period for London's Tricycle Theatre? Backstage at the Vaudeville Theatre on the Strand, Indhu Rubasingham is still catching her breath after a whirlwind week. The artistic director of the Tricycle Theatre is just back from New York, where her production of Red Velvet has opened to glowing reviews.  Now she is putting the finishing touches to her production of Moira Buffini's new play Handbagged, which sold out at the Tricycle last year and is now making a leap into the West End. If you personally judge yourself by awards then you're going to nowhere\u201d The play, which imagines the meetings between the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, is also a nominee at this Sunday's Olivier Awards, where it is up for outstanding achievement in affiliate theatre. Red Velvet was nominated in the same category last year. \"It's a great time for the Tricycle,\" says Rubasingham, who took over as artistic director in May 2012 after Nicolas Kent's 28 years at the helm.  \"If you personally judge yourself by awards then you're going to nowhere. Where these things help is on marketing, audiences, fundraising and profile.\"  The play's transition from the 200-seat theatre in Kilburn to the 700-seater Vaudeville has, she says, involved \"quite a bit of editing and tightening\".  Handbagged started life as a 20-minute piece in 2010. Plans to expand it were almost abandoned when it was announced that Peter Morgan's The Audience would open in the West End in 2013.  That play, starring Helen Mirren as the Queen, imagined the private meetings between the monarch and her prime ministers over her 60-year reign. \"In the end we thought it didn't matter,\" explains Rubasingham. \"They're actually very different stories.\"  As it turned out, Margaret Thatcher died three days before Buffini was due to start work on the full-length play. \"People thought we were really quick off the mark but it was always going to happen.\"  Handbagged's big theatrical idea is to double up the main roles.  Hence there are younger and older versions of the Queen (played by Lucy Robinson and Marion Bailey, respectively) and Margaret Thatcher (Fenella Woolgar and Stella Gonet).  Rubasingham says having both versions of each character on stage at the same time brought its own challenges for her as director. \"One may start a thought and the other one may finish it - it wasn't naturalism, it was pure theatre.  I felt like the play was stretching me, rather than me trying to make it work.\"  Both she and Buffini were \"Thatcher children\". Rubasingham recalls growing up in Mansfield, near Nottingham, during the miners' strikes.  \"When Moira was writing it we would talk a lot about our experiences. You realise how things that started at the time are the catalysts of what's happening now.  \"I wasn't a Thatcher fan growing up. Now it's not that I agree with her, but I've understood her a bit more, and I really admire that someone in that time, as a woman, had that kind of conviction politics, whether or not you agree with those politics.\" Rubasingham says the opening of Red Velvet in New York earlier this month was an \"emotional\" moment. She and playwright Lolita Chakrabarti first began talking about bringing the story to the stage eight years ago.   Starring Chakrabarti's husband Adrian Lester, Red Velvet tells the story of pioneering African-American actor Ira Aldridge, who caused a sensation in London in 1833 when he took over the role of Othello after famous actor Edmund Kean collapsed on stage. The play was Rubasingham's first project when she took over at the Tricycle. Almost two years on, it's now creating waves across the Atlantic.  \"It's been a huge journey, there were times when both of us thought this was never going to happen. Very rarely do those moments crystallise into something like this.\" She adds excitedly that Robert Redford had already been to see it. \"How has this happened after all that time when people were shutting the doors on it?\"  She thinks the script has film potential, and predicts the play will have a long life even after Lester has stepped down from the lead role. What kind of impact does a New York run and a West End transfer - Rubasingham's first from the Tricycle - have on the Kilburn theatre's finances? \"I don't know yet. The show in New York is not going to bring money to the Tricycle but it hasn't cost us money - but it raises the profile.  \"With Handbagged it's early days. If it sells and we more than break even, then money will come to the Tricycle.\"  Rubasingham sees investment as a key issue in theatre. \"The theatre community has got to communicate to society why it's important. The work we've done with Handbagged and Red Velvet has only come from Arts Council investment. I can take those risks.   \"In New York people say they don't see work like that because there isn't that investment. \"As a country we've got to put that investment in the arts because its our moral compass, it's our social conscience. It's our spiritual well-being as a society.  \"It's not just about luvvies having fun.\"  ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26968652", "title": ["Handbagged puts Queen and Margaret Thatcher back on stage"]},

{"article": "Bummed out and drugged up, Tove Lo turned a failed relationship into pop gold. She talks to the BBC about her unflinching lyrics, and the correct way to pronounce her name. There's a moment on Tove Lo's debut EP that will take your breath away. It comes on the final track,  , where some bore is telling the Swedish singer \"time will heal\" her broken heart. Suddenly, the music vanishes into a black hole and Tove yells: \"Are you   me?\"   I once set another girl's hair on fire accidentally\u201d It's pained and bruised and thrilling and glorious. A moment where meaning and musical intent align perfectly. \"I've always wanted my music to have that desperation,\" the singer says, \"where you just want to strip your clothes off and run down the highway.\" \"I want the feeling where you don't really know what to do with yourself - in the vocals, in the production. Everything.\" The 26-year-old cut her teeth writing songs for Girls Aloud and fellow Swedes Icona Pop, but her solo material is altogether more visceral. Her Truth Serum EP is an unflinching document of a failed relationship. \"Not my first,\" she says, \"but certainly the most intense\". The key track is Habits, currently playlisted on Radio 1, and written in the immediate aftermath of the break-up. \"You're gone, and I've got to stay high all the time to keep you off my mind,\" she sings.   downing shots and hooking up with strangers, then crying uncontrollably in a nightclub toilet. \"When they heard it, my friends were like, 'Boy, you're really giving it all away',\" the singer says. \"For my family, I think it was harder. My mum gets a bit worried. \"She sent me a text: 'I can understand the new video gives a very honest perspective of the song, but I will never, ever watch it again.'\" Sadly for her mum, Habits - with its catalogue of bad decisions, bad boyfriends and banned substances - is all-too-real.  \"I can't lie,\" Tove says. \"What I'm singing about is my life. It's the truth.  \"I've had moments where that [drug-taking] has been a bigger part than it should be.  \"It's hard to admit to, and I could filter it or find another metaphor for it - but it doesn't feel right to me.\" The man who inspired Truth Serum is a \"very spiritual, very special guy,\" the singer says. \"After he heard Habits, he sent me one very long, very self-destructive poem. He said everything I was saying, but from his end. Since then I haven't spoken to him.\" Despite her no-nonsense approach, Tove balances melodrama and melancholy with a twisted, and distinctly Scandinavian, sense of humour. An earlier, self-released single,  , parodies the preposterous promises musicians make in love songs.  \"Chop off my hands, chop off my feet,\" she sings, \"I'd do it for you. Ain't love sweet?\" At one point, she even threatens to set herself on fire. Not, one hopes, a lyric based on experience. \"No!\" she laughs. \"I have never set myself on fire... But I did once set another girl's hair on fire accidentally. \"We had an argument in a bar and she was walking away. I took out my lighter and kind of waved it in her direction, like \" \", and it accidentally caught in her hair.  \"There were fumes coming out, so I ran after her and patted her on the back to put it out, but she thought I was trying to hit her. It was really awkward.\" She might sound like a handful, but in person Tove Lo is likeable and slightly shy - fiddling with her hair and book-ending answers with a soft giggle. Born Ebba Tove Elsa Nilsson, she grew up in a \"pretty posh family\" in the Stockholm suburb of Djursholm.  Her life-long nickname \"Lo\" is Swedish for Lynx - a tufty species of wildcat she \"fell in love with\" while visiting an animal park. \"Three years old, I was standing with my face pressed against the glass,\" she recalls. \"I didn't want to leave. So my parents started calling me Tove Lo and it stuck.\" Home life was comfortable. \"We had a nice house,\" she says. \"We lived by the water and I was a pretty normal kid until my teenage years, then I dyed my hair pink and spiralled out of control.\" The reason for her rebellion was one Kurt Cobain. \"I fell in love with the Kurt and Courtney story, even though I was only 12,\" she says. \" I had all the posters on my bedroom wall - the   where he has loads of eyeliner. I was fascinated by grunge and it started there.  \"Growing up so safe, I think I was looking for something else.\" Although she's switched allegiance from grunge to pop, her use of dynamics (quiet verses, thunderous choruses) is still indebted to the Nirvana template. \"I'm a lot more inspired by that stuff than I think,\" she says. \"I like the music to be more direct - that's part of my way of writing without realising it.\" No wonder, then, that the Truth Serum EP - which contains more hooks than a coat rack - has made people sit up and listen. But the singer insists she never intended to become famous. \"If I wanted that, then I would have gone on Idol (Sweden's Pop Idol) - and I got the offer so many times,\" she says.  \"There's easy ways to get famous today if you want to. I had lots of meetings in the States, and they were saying, 'an artist is a business, we're going to turn you into an Empire!'  \"They would ask questions like, 'what would you wear to the red carpet?' and I would go 'I don't give a crap about the red carpet! Who cares?'\" Tove looks up to Beyonce - \"she never makes a mistake, she's not flawed vocally, physically\" - but sees her own career taking a different path. \"I'm a bit more rough around the edges. I couldn't release a fragrance - I don't even wear perfume - but obviously I'd like to have her audience!\" That day could come soon: Several magazines have anointed her a \"pop star in waiting\", and the singer is hard at work on her debut album.  \"I feel I have the songs,\" she says. \"That's what I love doing, so it doesn't scare me.  \"But I want the album to have the kind of storyline that Truth Serum has - so it feels connected, not a bunch of songs put together. It all depends how long that takes me.\" If that album makes her a star, and if she's very, very lucky, British DJs will finally learn how to say her name.  For the record, it's pronounced \" \" but Tove doesn't mind if people approach it phonetically. \"It's a Scandinavian name, so no-one's ever going to say it right in English,\" she laughs. \"And also,  sounds a bit like 'to the loo' which is not so good. So Tove Lo is alright.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26954021", "title": ["Tove Lo: A Swedish pop star in waiting"]},

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. David Sillito looks back at the life of Sue Townsend Sue Townsend failed her 11 plus, left school at 15 and wrote in secret, but she went on to become one of the UK's best-selling and beloved authors.  Susan Lillian Townsend was born in Leicester in 1946, the city where she set her most famous work, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4. The story of the pimply, pretentious teenager who painted his room black and obsessed about a girl called Pandora sold two million copies when it was released at the end of 1982.  Adored by fellow teenagers and adults alike, the book was followed by The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole in 1984 - making Townsend the best-selling novelist of the 1980s.  Townsend said she grew up \"comic-poor - what the Americans now call trailer-trash\", as the eldest of three daughters.  But there were always books in their home and, after discovering children's classics, she was soon reading one a day. \"I do think that books, good books, free you,\" she told writer Alan Clark, a friend and former creative writing student who interviewed her for Mediterranean Life magazine.  \"They make you feel a citizen of the world and things like class, sex and age don't matter. They're the greatest leveller.\" After leaving school, she worked as a petrol pump attendant, shop assistant and factory hand, before training as a community worker. She married at 18 but hid her writing from her first husband, inside sofa cushions and under the stairs. He left her and she was soon juggling three jobs, writing at night while her three children were asleep.  \"I became an insomniac, really, hardly slept at all, didn't even try to,\" she told The Guardian  .  \"And it's carried on. I hate to say I only need as much sleep as Mrs Thatcher, but I can cope really well on five hours.\" It was not until she confessed all to her partner Colin Broadway - who she later married and had another child with - that she was encouraged to join a local writers' group at the Phoenix Theatre in Leicester, winning an award for her first play.  The Adrian Mole series first started life as a play on BBC Radio 4 - first broadcast with the title The Diary of Nigel Mole, Aged 13 1/4.   A publisher heard it and offered her a contract to turn it into a book. A name change and another seven instalments followed along with TV and theatre adaptations.  Townsend often said she identified with Adrian but she was amazed by the book's success, both in the UK and abroad.  \"Now I realise that Adrian is simply a type of person who exists everywhere, regardless of nationality,\" she told Clark.  \"Shy, thoughtful, oversensitive, repressed. In a hut in the Gambia at this moment, there's an Adrian Mole getting on people's tits.\" She never allowed any of the books to carry an illustration of Mole though, as she wanted people to be able to visualise the character for themselves. Townsend had a heart attack when she was just 40 and was registered blind in 2001, after a 15-year battle with diabetes. She would lie on a sofa, dictating her final books to her writer son Sean, who - in 2009, donated one of his kidneys to his mother.  \"It makes me sound like Barbara Cartland. But I'm never as well groomed as she was,\"   in March 2012. During a BBC interview later that month, at the new Mansfield Library where she was speaking to a visually-impaired reading group, Townsend said of losing her sight: \"You can't underestimate what a devastating blow it is.\" She added: \"People would say, 'You're so good about it.' But inside... to me not being able to read, I still haven't come to terms with it yet.\" She also had neuropathic arthropathy - Charcot's joint -  which weakened the bones in her legs and feet and meant she had to use a wheelchair.  Before she lost her sight completely, Townsend would carry a large magnifying glass, which Stephen Mangan - who played Adrian in the BBC adaptation of The Cappuccino Years - remembers being trained on him.  \"When I auditioned to play Adrian, I remember she told me that he couldn't be too good looking,\" he said.  \"She pulled out a magnifying glass, came up right to my face - because her sight was just in the last stages of going, scanned me all over and said that I was indeed 'not good-looking enough to play the part'.  \"She was very funny, there was a lot of laughter whenever you met Sue,\" added Mangan.   Media requires JavaScript to play. Adrian Mole author Sue Townsend reveals she still has not come to terms with losing her eyesight through diabetes. The Cappuccino Years was a satire on New Labour, with Pandora now an MP and Adrian a chef in London.  Townsend was a passionate socialist and politics also influenced Adrian Mole's teenage years, under Thatcher's government. The eighth Mole instalment, Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years, was published in 2009.  However, Townsend suffered a stroke over Christmas 2012 and, at the Oxford Literary Festival a few months later, revealed she had to push back the release date of the ninth book as a result.  \"It was on the way until the stroke interrupted me,\" she said.  Her other best-selling novels include The Queen and I - about the Royal Family being forced to move to a council estate after a revolution - and 2012's The Woman Who Went to Bed for a Year, about a middle aged mum who refuses to get up from bed.  \"Oh I'd love to [do that],\" Townsend told The Big Issue. \"A month would be great. Just getting up now and again, you know, to take showers and stuff. I wouldn't get bored, I'd listen to the radio.\" Townsend also published a more serious novel, Ghost Children, about the life-long effects of having an abortion, based on her own experiences - and often talked about writing \"a masterpiece\".  \"I wanted to be Dostoevsky but my way of coping with the world has always been humour,\" she told Clark.  \"In the playground I always made people laugh, I used to charge them three pence for an impression of a teacher. It kept me in toffees.\" Writers and comedians including JK Rowling, David Walliams, Matt Lucas and Caitlin Moran were all quick to pay tribute to that humour on Twitter.  Having left school at 15, Townsend was awarded an honorary Masters of Arts from Leicester University and, in 2008, was made a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the university. She was also an Honorary Doctor of Letters at Loughborough University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. \"I hate it when people call me a 'national treasure',\"   in 2010, while promoting The Prostrate Years.  \"It takes away your bite and makes you feel like a harmless old golden Labrador.\" In 2009, Townsend was given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester.  She was surrounded by her family when she died at her home in the city on 10 April, following a short illness.

{"article": "Welsh director Gareth Evans reveals why he chose to make a follow-up to The Raid, the low-budget martial arts thriller that became an international hit in 2011. Indonesian film The Raid cost around $1 million (\u00a3596,000) to make but made 15 times that sum at the worldwide box office in 2011. Described by some film critics as \"the best action film of all time\", its visceral martial arts scenes and large body count made it a cult classic with fans. Now The Raid 2 arrives in UK cinemas, four months on from its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Its maker is 34-year-old Gareth Evans, originally from Hirwaun in south Wales, who now lives in Indonesia.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Gareth Evans talks to BBC Wales Today about his career and films According to Evans, the first film's plot was \"pretty simple, because we had no budget. A policeman, Rama, has to fight his way to the top of a gang-controlled building without dying himself.\" In contrast, The Raid 2 \"has far more of a story [that] expands the criminal world of the first film\". \"If the audience are willing to follow us into it,\" Evans continues, \"it will have a very different feel to the first one.\" The Raid became the most successful Indonesian film release of all time, prompting international interest in Pencak Silat, the local martial art it featured, and making a star of Iko Uwais, the stuntman-actor who plays Rama.  Evans and Uwais had worked together before on Merentau, a cult martial arts hit in Indonesia. The international reaction to The Raid, though, took both by surprise. \"I never expected it,\" admits Evans. \"And at first it felt like there was a certain amount of novelty publicity around it. A Welshman has made this Indonesian martial arts movie, there's a thing! \"What it has done is given both myself and Iko a certain amount of career security. I certainly had offers to make other films after it came out, but nothing compared to the prospect of making the sequel. I was passionately committed to it.\" Now signed to the prestigious William Morris talent agency in the US, Evans is also serving as a producer on a Hollywood remake of The Raid. The film will be made by The Expendables 3 director Patrick Hughes, with   suggesting Australian actor Chris Hemsworth or his brother Liam will take the lead role. \"I know that it's inevitable that a great foreign language movie will be made and Hollywood will want to remake it,\" sighs Evans. \"Just like The Ring or Let the Right One In, fans will look at it and say 'why on earth is it getting remade? The only thing that's any different is there are no subtitles.' \"But the way I see it is that some kid who listens to Justin Bieber will probably go and see the Hollywood version of The Raid, and then he might discover the foreign originals that I've made. \"Once he's seen these films, I doubt he'll like Justin Bieber any more. In that way, I'll have done some good in the world.\" The Raid 2 picks up a couple of hours from where the first film ended, with Rama - having just disposed of hundreds of criminals - being asked to go undercover in prison. Those who loved the first story for its non-stop martial arts sequences may be disappointed that the new film, at two-and-a-half hours and with five times the budget, has more dialogue and conversation pieces in the criminal underworld where it is set. \"I don't think I've made a big, bloated film with the budget I've had,\" Evans counters. \"In fact, every penny is on screen again. \"I hope fans will like it because this is the film I originally wrote, when I wanted to make the first Raid, but we simply didn't have the money. \"I was a frustrated director, simply desperate to make a film, and so I rewrote it to be set around one building, which was considerably cheaper than multiple locations. \"This still has all the blood and guts of the first; I think there might be more actually. I hope it's still a visceral spectacle. \"The Raid 2 is very violent. I appreciate some people won't like that, but you have to remember we are following a film tradition of Indonesian martial arts films. I want to have made something edgy.\" Uwais and Evans are now local heroes in Indonesia, where they are credited for bringing back a martial art movie tradition that, according to the director, \"died off in the 1970s\". Despite this, the Welshman reveals his next two directing jobs will be in the UK and the US.  \"Everything is working really, really well for me right now,\" he says. \"Just being able to make a film is a dream come true.\" Raid fans need not fret, though. Evans is open that the series was designed as a trilogy and has pledged will return to direct the final instalment.  \"I've already planned it out - it's definitely going to happen,\" he insists. \"There's going to be no rest for the characters at the end of this film.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26910069", "title": ["Welsh director Gareth Evans returns with Indonesian action sequel"]},
{"article": "Sajid Javid, the Conservative MP for Bromsgrove, has been appointed culture secretary by David Cameron following the resignation of Maria Miller. Born in Rochdale in 1969, the 44-year-old former banker has been promoted from his previous role as Financial Secretary to the Treasury. A lot will be waiting for this bus driver's son at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). But what should be top of his list of priorities? The BBC News website asked the editors of four publications that focus on the arts and the creative industries what their readers want from him. I think what the UK film industry wants most from government is a sense of stability, particularly in the continuation of the  , which is an essential piece of the puzzle for keeping the British film industry surviving and thriving. What would be disastrous is if the new minister would make any sort of rash decision without consulting industry, the way Jeremy Hunt did in  . Now that the BFI is the  , they need to be allowed to just get on with the jobs at hand. Chris Smith's   and its follow-up review have laid out a clear plan of action. The hope is that any new minister will help the experts get on with that plan, not muddy the waters with their own input at this stage. It has to be said that culture minister Ed Vaizey has been a consistent and interested governmental voice about the film industry for a number of years. That's an asset for a new culture secretary, to have Vaizey's perspective after he's taken a genuine interest in understanding the industry.  But in short, the tax credit's stability, or even furthering it as recently proposed, is the most important thing that the culture secretary needs to protect. I think the vast majority of people in the music industry are pretty sick and tired of seeing music not regarded as one of the government's favoured creative industries. Video games, TV and the animation industry all recently won   in an announcement that was supposed to cover all the creative industries. Music once again was forgotten in that round. The industry has obviously been very hurt by copyright infringement over the past 15 years, particularly online. I think it's fair to say it would like to see action from government to assist with that. UK music as a net export is a huge success story for the UK and they would also like to see that reflected in policy making. I think it will be a huge relief if Sajid Javid acknowledged the music industry alongside the more tech-touched industries that have a sort of halo effect around them at the moment, from video games to animation to online programme making. There seems to be a belief within the current government that the UK tech industries are the only area for growth. But without content and without owning the rights to the things people want to be entertained by and engaged with, you don't have an industry. That's a message the music industry will want the culture secretary to be driving home at cabinet meetings. Music content is more widely listened to than ever before and the industry just wants to see it protected. We've seen Adele and Ed Sheeran and other artists emerge on the world stage in the last five years, so it would also be lovely to see if some sort of tax relief could help bring through the next era of British artists. In terms of theatre and the performing arts, I would say getting the   that's coming in later this year right and making sure the details are ironed out and making sure it's the one that works best for the sector has got to be near the top of his list. The last budget announced a brand new tax relief for theatre investment along the lines of the film tax relief that already exists. It's a   so it won't be directly Sajid Javid's brief. But it is his sector that it's going to affect, so I would have thought he'll be involved in getting it put through. Another area that Maria Miller wasn't as active in as she could have been, was the role of the DCMS in encouraging local authorities to fund culture. If there's one big funding issue in the arts from a theatre point of view, it's local council funding. I don't think enough has been done to encourage local authorities to continue their support for the arts. The third thing is working with the Department of Education to ensure that funding levels at arts training institutions are retained as much as possible, because a lot of drama schools are feeling the pinch at the moment. Hopefully the new culture secretary can bring some knowledge of how the Treasury works into the arts sector, to help it make a better case for funding and make the argument in a way the Treasury understands. The first thing is it's important to appear interested. It's important to be seen at things, to go and visit things and get to know the art world. And it's important not just to be seen at the National Gallery or the Tate, but to take some time to visit small arts organisations out in the regions. It helps a lot if the impression is that the culture secretary is genuinely interested - that always wins friends. Number two is obviously the issues around funding. The Conservative Party has increasingly started talking the language of art and the economy; they seem to see it very much from the economic aspect. Now art does have an  , but I think people feel in our world that arts offer more than economic value. Museums, art exhibitions, cultural events have a social benefit, an educational benefit, and I think it would be good for the secretary to understand that. Abroad, this is what we're known for. People like Thomas Heatherwick, Jonathan Ive, all the YBAs [Young British Artists] - people know who they are. Abroad, our art output is seen as a very important thing. But those people nearly all grew up at a time when art school was relatively cheap to go to and it was less of a risk. Becoming a really good artist is a long slow and painful process and it would be good for that to be understood. That's something the art world in the UK feels has got lost in the mix. I think we want a culture secretary who would be looking to protect the Arts Council and museums from any other cuts, and who really understands the educational and social benefit of the arts, from school to museum-visiting as an adult. There's also the issue around smaller arts organisations that tend to get funded through local authority budgets. There have been cuts at the local authority level that have affected arts in the region quite badly, and there's a general feeling that the regions have slid down the priority list. The minister could also do his best to persuade the Treasury to make it more attractive for the very wealthy to donate money and art, and not just to big institutions like the Tate. They should also be encouraged to give more money to museums and organisations in the regions. And there's one final point. We really ought to sign the  , which is all about the protection of heritage in war-torn countries. I know there have been cross-party moves to get the convention signed, but we haven't signed it. It's something the DCMS could take a lead on, in tandem with the Foreign Office.

{"article": "Sir Cameron Mackintosh says his 25th anniversary revival of Miss Saigon has attracted advance ticket sales from an \"incredibly young\" audience.  The musical, set during the Vietnam War, opened in London on Wednesday in front of a celebrity-packed audience.  It has already broken box office records for advance bookings.  \"For me in my own lifetime to reinvent one of the greatest musicals ever written is a privilege,\" said Sir Cameron.  Among the star names at the show were Stephen Fry, Lord Julian Fellowes, Miranda Hart, actor Eddie Redmayne and film director Tom Hooper. Based on the opera Madame Butterfly, Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's musical tells the tragic story of an orphaned Vietnamese girl, Kim, who falls in love with an American GI named Chris. Schonberg and Boublil, who also wrote Les Miserables, have written a new song called Maybe for the production.  \"This show seems to have a stronger rapport with the audience than it did 25 years ago,\" said Sir Cameron, after the opening night at the Prince Edward Theatre.  \"We've got record breaking advance booking but it's not from the normal theatre audience. It's from mostly younger people, a few hardcore fans, but mostly younger people who've never seen the show. They've heard about it from their parents.\"  The theatre impresario - whose other productions include Les Miserables, Cats and The Phantom of the Opera - was recently named among the billionaires on the Sunday Times super-rich list.  Miss Saigon broke the record for the largest single day of sales in West End and Broadway history when it went on sale last September, with takings of \u00a34.4m on the first day. That figure eclipsed the amount taken by The Book of Mormon, which set the previous record in March 2013 when it took \u00a32.1m in one day. Sir Cameron said the revamped production of Les Miserables in New York was also attracting a new generation of musical fans. \"With this show, and Les Miserables and The Book of Mormon, the audience is incredibly young.\" Miss Saigon arrives after a number of other recent high-profile West End casualties. The X Factor-inspired musical I Can't Sing! closed after just two months. The Full Monty closed after five weeks, Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Stephen Ward lasted for four months and the curtain came down on Sir Tim Rice's From Here to Eternity after six months. \"It's unfortunate when other shows close but that's been happening all my career,\" said Sir Cameron. \"Two or three shows close and it becomes a great news story. When two open, everybody says: 'Everyone wants to see musical'.\" In Miss Saigon, the seedy role of The Engineer is played by Jon Jon Briones, who was in the original 1989 London cast. \"I was part of the ensemble,\" he recalled. \"I was surrounded by talented people and The Engineer was played by Jonathan Pryce. Watching him at rehearsals was a master-class every day.\" Eva Noblezada, 18, who plays Kim, has yet to graduate from her school in North Carolina, US.  \"It was so powerful tonight,\" she told the BBC. \"I do love to hear the sniffles in the audience because that means we did a good job.\"  praised her \"deeply felt performance and soaring voice\". In his four-star review, Charles Spencer said: \"Laurence Connor's production has a cinematic fluency and he keeps the dramatic tension simmering throughout. For all its many merits, however, I find it easier to admire Miss Saigon than to love it.\" \"It's less operatic than before and has a grittier feel. Yet it remains a huge spectacle, and the music surges and soars,\" said the   Henry Hitchings.  \"I can't say I was deeply moved, unlike the lady in front of me forever dabbing her eyes,\" admitted   Michael Billington. \"But I came away feeling this is a successful variation on an old tale and put across with exemplary vigour.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27483629", "title": ["Miss Saigon attracts new audience for 25th anniversary"]},
{"article": "Mancunian illustrator Stan Chow's cartoon portraits of famous faces has won him worldwide fame. Now a major retrospective is being held of his 20-year career at a gallery in his home town. Stan Chow's artwork is, by his own admission, about \"simple geometric shapes, flat colour and sweeping curves\". Two decades on from his first forays, it is a simplicity that has seen him garner fans and commissions worldwide. While his work has covered a wide variety of topics, it is his portraits of famous faces that he has become known for and the striking images have graced magazines, books and posters across the world. He says that while the portraits might look simple, it is \"pot luck\" as to how long each work will take. \"Sometimes it can take a few minutes, sometimes it can take hours. \"My favourite ones are the ones where I can nail the likeness pretty quickly and be as economical as possible, like my Bruce Willis silhouette and the Woody Allen.\" He says entertaining people with his style began, as things so often do, in the pub. \"Back in the day, I used to go drinking with [Elbow's] Guy Garvey a lot. Just to entertain myself and the people around us, I'd do a sketch of Guy using literally four or five strokes. \"It wasn't super-flattering, but it did look like him and it was striking - and he would usually do an impression of me which would entertain him greatly.\" Some faces have not been as easy to capture. He says one in particular caused him problems - that of Britney Spears. \"It was for the New Yorker magazine. They wanted an illustration of her post nose-job.  \"The problem with Britney is I don't recognise the post nose-job Britney as Britney.  \"The Britney I know is the one with the slightly weird nose, wearing a uniform in the Hit Baby One More Time video. \"The eventual illustration was given the thumbs up, but it messed with my head a little having to do that portrait.\" Now his achievement is being recognised with an exhibition at Manchester's Centre for Contemporary Chinese Art. He says he is delighted to put on the show but admits that it was \"never a conscious decision for my style to be how it is\". \"The more you illustrate, paint and draw, the more you evolve into the artist you become. \"I also realised when becoming a professional illustrator that there were some clients who would give you impossible deadlines to work to, like a call at 5pm for a print deadline the next morning. \"You have to learn how to work fast, so I guess my style has been streamlined somewhat to suit clients.\" The streamlining took \"about seven or eight years to fine tune\" - time in which he says he \"learnt to become economical and speedy\". \"There's a phrase in cookery - 'minimum effort, maximum impact'. It's slowly becoming my mantra.  \"Ultimately I do like to finish an illustration in less than a day - for me there's nothing more frustrating than going to sleep with an unfinished work to wake up to.\" It is not the only subject to cause him concern. Another has been much closer to home, his self-portrait. \"The problem now with doing a self portrait that looks like me is that I have to illustrate myself with a round face.  \"I actually do have a round face [but] it disappoints me that I have a round face nowadays. I much prefer my portraits when I was younger and my face was slightly slimmer.\" How he got that round face could be revealed in the retrospective, titled The Takeaway, which he says tells \"the story of my life, where I grew up to where I am today\". \"I grew up in a chip shop - the reason why I am an illustrator is because growing up, the only form of amusement I had was with a biro and chip paper.  \"I didn't really have many toys when I was a nipper, all I did was draw and draw and draw.\" He says the shop gave him his \"first big break\" while he was working there after art school. \"One evening, whilst a customer was waiting for his sweet and sour chicken, I started doodling on the paper. \"He seemed unnervingly interested in my doodles and we struck up a conversation. \"He told me he was an art director at an ad agency - anyway it's a long story, but it's the first chapter of how I got to where I am today.\" The rest, as they say, is history.

{"article": "Prince Rupert Loewenstein, the Bavarian banker credited with turning the Rolling Stones into the world's richest rock band, has died at the age of 80. Loewenstein, who became a close friend of Mick Jagger and godfather to his son James, was the band's financial manager for nearly 40 years. It was on Loewenstein's advice that the Stones became tax exiles, decamping to the South of France in the 1970s. Yet he famously wrote he was \"never a fan of the Stones' music\". In an autobiography published last year, Loewenstein wrote: \"To many outsiders, it must seem extraordinary that I was never a fan of the Stones' music, or indeed of rock and roll in general. \"Yet I feel that precisely because I was not a fan\u2026 I was able to view the band and what they produced calmly, dispassionately, maybe even clinically - though never without affection.\"  Part of the royal house of Wittelsbach, Loewenstein was born in Majorca in 1933, but educated in Britain, studying history at Oxford before going on to work in the City.  Jagger met Loewenstein in the late 60s when he was the head of a small London merchant bank. The singer asked for his help in extricating the band from their contract with then-manager Allen Klein, who was taking 50 per cent of their recording royalties. It was the beginning of a partnership that would last until 2007 and helped Jagger amass an estimated fortune of \u00a3200 million. Aside from establishing their status as tax exiles, he was responsible for turning the Stones into a global brand, copyrighting the infamous tongue logo and establishing tour sponsorship and advertising deals with key companies. However, the relationship turned sour towards their end of their business dealings, when Jagger rejected several commercially lucrative proposals set up by Loewenstein, including a musical collaboration with Cameron Mackintosh. The band and Loewenstein eventually parted ways seven years ago. Jagger decried the publication of Lowenstein's autobiography A Prince Among Stones last year. \"Call me old-fashioned,\" the singer was quoted as saying, \"but I don't think your ex-bank manager should be discussing your financial dealings and personal information in public.\" The prince died earlier this week following a long illness.

Writing in the  , Andrew Clark referred to the singer as \"a chubby bundle of puppy-fat\". \"Clearly overt sexism is still rife,\" said opera singer Jennifer Johnston. \"Have we arrived at a point where opera is no longer about singing but about the physiques and looks of the singers, specifically the female singers?\" she wrote in an   for the Guardian.

{"article": "Activision Blizzard is trying to sue hackers who have created cheats for its Starcraft II video game. The publisher says the software undermines online multiplayer battles and could cause players to lose interest in the title. It has filed   calling for the unidentified programmers to be made to compensate it for copyright infringement. One industry watcher described the move as \"aggressive\". \"The only reason that cheats like this exist is because there is demand for them,\" said Ed Barton, a video games analyst at the consultancy Ovum. \"But the competitive scene for Starcraft is very important, especially in Korea, and Blizzard needs to preserve the fantasy of the core experience.\" News of the legal action was first reported by the  , which noted that the ValiantChaos MapHack cheats at the centre of the case remained available online if gamers paid a \"donation\" of $62.50 (\u00a337). The creators have promoted the hack on Blizzard's own forums as well as other sites. The science fiction real-time strategy game Starcraft II was released on 27 July 2010, and has subsequently been followed up with expansion packs, Blizzard's   noted that the Heart of the Swarm add-on was 2013's best-selling PC game at US stores, and the company is still working on a final extension called Legacy of the Void. Its court filing talks of wanting \"to protect the sanctity of the Starcraft II gaming experience\" and notes that its terms and conditions explicitly prohibit the use of \"hacks, mods or any other unauthorised third-party software\" designed to allow a player to boost their ranking and access new weapons and abilities. \"The competitive aspect of Starcraft II's multiplayer environment is one of the driving forces behind sales of the game,\" it states. \"In fact, the Starcraft game are played as a competitive sport around the world, with professional or semi-professional players competing for national and international titles. \"Additionally, the ability to play the game against skilled human opponents keeps the player experience fresh and interesting, thus ensuring that players return to the game frequently.\" The firm adds that it wishes the court to shut down the hacks and make their creators hand over the profits they had made. The case has echoes of Nintendo's court battles against the Games Genie - a cartridge that allowed players to enter codes to cheat at Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) titles in the early 1990s. Nintendo also alleged copyright infringement but lost the case after the judge ruled that consumers had the right to \"experiment with the product\" after paying a fair price for a game. Nintendo's rival Sega later gave its backing to the product and helped fund its marketing campaign. However, Blizzard has been more successful in this area following 1998's introduction of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which criminalised software designed to bypass digital locks.  In 2010 the firm won a copyright infringement  , which had sold a software \"bot\" that automatically played the early levels of World of Warcraft for players. \"The law in this area is relatively new as these forms of online games are only a decade old,\" Jas Purewal, editor of the Gamer Law news site told the BBC. \"Nonetheless, there have been a number of victories in this area and overall the odds are stacked against hackers and against cheaters once a games company is determined to take legal action.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27511932", "title": ["Blizzard sues Starcraft II cheat hackers"]},

Earlier, one witness denied fabricating an assault, as Sangita Myska reports Entertainer Rolf Harris was branded \"the octopus\" after repeatedly groping a TV make-up artist, a court has heard.  The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told Southwark Crown Court there were more than two dozen such assaults during the day. Earlier, another witness denied making up claims she was groped by Mr Harris, of Berkshire, in a pub when she was 15. The star, 84, denies 12 historic indecent assault charges related to four girls aged seven or eight to 19. The incidents are alleged to have taken place between 1968 and 1986. The former TV makeup artist, who gave evidence from behind a screen, said Mr Harris was known as the octopus because \"it was all hands\". The entertainer repeatedly put his hands inside the freelancer's baggy denim shorts as far as her hips while making a programme in Australia in 1986, she told jurors. Southwark Crown Court heard that on one occasion while groping her that day, Harris even discussed her legs with the programme's male director, who was standing next to them. She told the jury she later complained to her female supervisor: \"That dirty old man groped me all day.\" The woman, who was in her 20s at the time, is providing evidence in support of the prosecution case. However, none of the charges relate to her. Three of the 12 counts relate to Tonya Lee, 43, from Australia, who says she was in London on a theatre trip in 1986.  Miss Lee, who has waived her right to anonymity, had previously told the court Mr Harris had assaulted her at the start of her group's six-week visit to the UK. However, on Wednesday, she admitted she got the date of one of the alleged assaults wrong. An itinerary of the tour produced by Sonia Woodley QC, for the defence, said there would be a \"celebratory meal with Rolf Harris\" in a public house in Greenwich at the end of their tour. Miss Lee told the court she was \"not a robot\" with a head for dates but she had \"no doubt\" the assault took place, in a pub in Greenwich, south-east London. \"There is no doubt in my mind what occurred to me,\" she said. \"Both assaults are very clear in my mind. I got the dates wrong, I admit to that.\" Miss Lee also dismissed prosecution claims that she had made up the story because she was motivated by money. The court was told she had made a \u00a333,000-deal with a Sydney publicity agent to give interviews to an Australian TV station and a magazine. The jurors were also shown a newspaper article in which Miss Lee complained that not all of the money due to her had been paid.  She added: \"That was blood money. That's not money for frivolity or fun.\" Wednesday's second witness, a former partner of Mr Harris's daughter, said he was told by one of the complainants that the entertainer had an under-age sexual relationship with her. Malcolm Cox said the woman, a friend of Bindi Harris, was visiting the Harris family home in Bray, Berkshire, in 1996 or 1997 when she told him there had been a sexual relationship between Mr Harris and her, and it had occurred before the age of 16.

It took the unusual step after Dr James Townsend, a medical officer at the base, wrote and asked for permission to screen it for his colleagues. It had been one of the last shows he had seen before he left the UK. Dr Townsend, who arrived at the base on Christmas Day 2012, had the idea after he read about the play's success at the Olivier Awards in 2013. \"Having seen it shortly before I left the UK, I was trying to explain to the other guys here what it was like and why it was so good,\" he told the BBC News website. \"I failed miserably, I think, but had the notion that, if they saw it, it would all make sense, so contacted the NT Live team to see if it was possible to get a screening of it down here somehow. \"Obviously we were outside normal broadcast range but very kindly - and I think the only time they've done it - they offered to send a DVD copy of it down to me here to show on base.\" A National Theatre spokesperson confirmed that National Theatre Live shows - which are screened in cinemas - were not released on DVD but an exception had been made in this case.  Dr Townsend, a regular theatre-goer when he lived in London, screened the DVD for his colleagues at the base earlier this year and plans to show it again during the Antarctic winter, which began this month.  \"With the sun having set on 1 May, it's the last time for about 103 days that we'll see it above the horizon.

It played a critical role in the research that identified the ozone \"hole\" in 1985. Dr Townsend said that as well as watching TV and films as recreation, the crew at the base enjoyed cross-country skiing or kiting and visiting the nearby Emperor penguin colony.  He said: \"Some of the best entertainment for me is simply going out on the dark, still, crisp winter days and just laying on my back, just looking up at the starriest of star-filled skies, listening to nothing but your breath crackle and freeze with every exhalation.\"  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, based on Mark Haddon's award-winning novel, screens again in UK cinemas on Thursday.

The writer said: \"How could the richest country in the world allow so many of its people to live in such abject poverty?\" Millar said Detroit needed superheroes but not the traditional ones like super-rich playboy Bruce Wayne in Batman, or billionaire weapons dealer Tony Stark in Iron Man. He said: \"Sometimes I wonder if it's political sleight-of-hand to write about threats to Gotham City or Metropolis when we should be writing about those bad guys in the real world who look an awful lot like Bruce Wayne.\" The writer added: \"Is it a crime if a superhero puts food on the table for people who have nothing? \"Four superheroes taking down the bankers couldn't be more different than Superman or Batman, who sometimes look the other way when the real villains are operating. \"These are the good guys America needs right now.\" Millar said he had put his \"heart and soul\" into the comic book and Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the producer on three Transformers movies, was planning to turn it into a Hollywood film.  As well as comic books, Millar worked on 2008 movie Wanted starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy; 2010's Kick-Ass starring Nicholas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz; and last year's Kick-Ass 2 featuring Jim Carrey.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. The sermon was written after Mansfield Park was published but may have been influenced by earlier drafts of the novel, experts think A handwritten note by Jane Austen \"hidden\" for 150 years on the back of a fragment of paper has been revealed. Experts have linked the text on both the front and back to themes in the author's novel Mansfield Park. The fragment was stuck to a letter discovered in a first edition of her memoirs, written by her nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh.  The revealed text is part of a sermon apparently composed by her brother, the Reverend James Austen in 1814. The book and letter, written by Jane Austen's nephew in 1870, had been held in a private collection but was recently bought for an undisclosed sum by the Jane Austen museum in Chawton, Hampshire. Very few examples of Jane Austen's handwriting survive - there are no manuscripts of her famous books and many of her letters were destroyed after her death. A team at West Dean College near Chichester, West Sussex, succeeded in unsticking the fragment, allowing the previously unseen writing on the back to be deciphered. It reads: \"...great propriety preserved - Wherever... wanted to be cleared of the Superstitious... of Popery... or whenever new ones were to be... composed in order to fill up & connect the Services... with a true spirit.\" While the front of the fragment reads: \"Men may get into a habit of repeating the words of our Prayers by rote, perhaps without thoroughly understanding - certainly without thoroughly feeling their full force and meaning.\"  Experts claim the text echoes a passage in Mansfield Park which was also published in 1814 - a few months before the sermon text was written. They say it reflects a discussion in the novel on the \"art of reading\" and its importance to the modern clergyman. Jane Austen's eldest brother, James, was rector at the church of St Nicholas in Steventon, and she would travel there to stay with him. Historians believe she helped copy out his sermons for him. Mary Guyatt, museum curator, said: \"What we have to go on is the nephew's transcription.  \"He's cut up the sermon in around 1817 and he's written underneath it 'this is the writing but not the words of the author Jane Austen, my aunt.' \"He's very clear that it was his father's composition.\" But Prof Kathryn Sutherland, of St Anne's College, Oxford, said it showed earlier drafts of Mansfield Park at least influenced her brother. \"The scrap raises the possibility that the novel inspired James's sermon and even demonstrates the cross-fertilization between Jane Austen's creative writing and the wider life of her family.\" Historians will now study the note for clues to whether the sermon may after all have been written by Jane Austen. It will go on display at the museum later this year.

Welcome to New York, screened at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday, is about a French banker who sexually assaults a maid at a New York hotel. Mr Strauss-Kahn quit as head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011 after facing similar allegations. The 65-year-old was arrested in New York three years ago when a maid at the Sofitel hotel in New York accused him of trying to rape her. The charges were eventually dropped, and Mr Strauss-Kahn subsequently reached a settlement with the maid, Nafissatou Diallo. He is   in an unrelated case in France on charges of hiring prostitutes for sex parties - allegations he denies.  His lawyer, Jean Veil, said the former IMF boss would take legal action for \"defamation over the accusations of rape and the insinuations made throughout the movie\". He added that Mr Strauss-Kahn was \"disgusted and frightened\" by the film, which stars French actor Gerard Depardieu in the lead role. \"The prosecutor in New York cleared him of all charges [and] he has a right to be forgotten like everyone else,\" Mr Veil told French radio station Europe 1 on Monday. The lawyer also alleged that Welcome to New York carried \"anti-Semitic\" overtones.

Welcome to New York tells the story of how a French economics professor becomes a politician backed by his wife's millions and rises to fame and prosperity only to be brought down by accusations of rape. The film's American director, Abel Ferrara, responded to news of the lawsuit by invoking his \"freedom of expression\". \"[Strauss-Kahn] is not the only guy who got caught in a situation like this,\" he said, adding: \"Let my lawyer talk to his lawyer.\" The movie opens with a disclaimer, which reads: \"This film was inspired by a court case, the public stages of which have been filmed, broadcast , reported and commented on throughout the media worldwide. Nonetheless the characters portrayed in the film and all sequences depicting their private lives remain entirely fictional.\" The film, which was funded mostly in the US, will not be screened in French cinemas, and instead only shown on pay-to-view websites.

{"article": "Gabby Logan is the latest household name to admit being part of the tax avoidance scheme used by Gary Barlow and Colin Jackson. The sports presenter invested thousands into Icebreaker, a company which purported to support young musicians. However, a recent court ruling said the firm was \"understood by all concerned to be a tax avoidance scheme\". Logan says she invested in the scheme in \"good faith\" and vowed \"to pay any tax\" she owes. She added that she pulled out of the scheme in 2012. \"I have been completely open and honest with HMRC and I have never hidden anything\u201d Logan issued the following statement  , following press speculation about her involvement in the scheme. \"I was advised about a business opportunity six years ago (2008) and I invested in good faith.  \"It was explained to me as a way of funding new acts in the music industry. Because of information which came to light in 2012, I decided the investment was not right for me.  \"With new professional help and advisors, I have for some time been working to resolve the issue and I fully intend to pay any tax which should have been paid, had I not entered the business. The presenter said she had been \"completely open and honest\" with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), adding: \"I have never hidden anything.\" Take That singer Gary Barlow - along with band-mates Howard Donald and Mark Owen, and manager Jonathan Wild - were among about 1,000 people who put money into the Icebreaker scheme. Since March 2010, the four men have been directors of Larkdale LLP - one of 50 partnerships that Icebreaker arranged to harness tax reliefs that the government had intended would support those in creative industries. The tribunal found that shortly after money was put in to Larkdale LLP, it reported huge losses of more than \u00a325m. Those losses could then be offset against tax, reducing the men's tax bills. In total, around 50 partnerships with hundreds of members invested in Icebreaker, which claimed total losses of \u00a3336m. Last week, former Olympic hurdler and BBC broadcaster Colin Jackson admitted to being in one such partnership, Sparkdale LLP, along with a number of dentists and lawyers. He defended his decision to invest in the loss-making scheme,   he was proud to have supported struggling musicians.  \"If it means you have to take a hit then I'll happily take a hit,\" he said. \"People have invested in me in the past to help me get to the top of my game. I'll still invest in people to help them get to the top of their game.\" HMRC pursued Icebreaker through the courts after the Times newspaper first exposed the scheme in 2012. Its members have until 2 July to decide whether they want to appeal. HMRC said it would be seeking payment of the tax in the meantime.

Officer Chris No says police arrived at the couple's home on Monday evening after a report of shots being fired. Officials say 40-year-old April Jace was found dead inside. Michael Jace, 51, was then taken into custody and booked on suspicion of homicide. He is being held on $1 million (\u00a3593,000) bail. Lt. John Jenal from the Los Angeles Police Department said two children were at the single-family home at the time of the shooting. They were in protective custody on Tuesday morning, he told LA's City News Service. Celebrity website   claims the actor called police himself to report the shooting. In March 2011, Jace filed for bankruptcy protection, with debts of between $500,000 (\u00a3297,000) and $1 million (\u00a3593,000). Much of the debt appeared to relate to his home as well as more than $22,000 (\u00a313,000) owed in state and federal income taxes. In documents submitted at the time, his wife was listed as a public school teacher with more than 10 years' experience. In a statement listing his possessions, Jace marked down that he didn't own any firearms. There are no records of any criminal cases involving the actor in Los Angeles. Jace played Detective Julien Lowe in FX drama The Shield and was a police officer in Southland. He also had parts in Forrest Gump, State of Play, Boogie Nights and Planet of the Apes. The actor and his wife were married for nine years while Jace has another child from a previous relationship. He was previously married to Jennifer Bitterman but they divorced in 2002. The Shield ran for seven series, from 2002 to 2008, and won a Golden Globe for best television drama series in 2002.

{"article": "Netflix has announced plans to expand to a further six European countries before the end of the year. The TV and movie streaming service intends to launch in Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg. The US-based firm has 48 million subscribers in over 40 countries. One analyst said the success of the latest rollout might depend on how much content was dubbed into local languages. \"Germany potentially could be quite a difficult market as it has low pay-TV penetration and seemingly low willingness to pay,\" said Ian Maude from the media consultancy Enders Analysis. \"One thing I'm curious to see in Germany is whether or not it has dubbed a lot of the show for the market because - while French TV has a lot of subtitling - in Germany foreign language movies and TV shows are generally voiced over, and that can be quite an expensive process.\" Germany's large number of broadband users - the fourth biggest such population in the world - makes it a potentially lucrative market.  However, Netflix will have to compete against video-on-demand incumbents including Sky Deutschland's Snap, Vivendi's Watchever, ProSiebenSat.1's MaxDome and Amazon Instant Video. In France, it faces the prospect of competing against a rival that owns the rights to a series branded a \"Netflix exclusive\" in other territories: Vivendi's CanalPlay owns the domestic rights to the second season of the drama House of Cards in the country. Netflix also must contend with the fact that French audiovisual laws require local broadcasters to invest significant sums in domestic content. However, Les Echos   Netflix might get around this by basing the service in Luxembourg. For now, the firm has only said it would provide \"further details, including pricing, programming and supported devices at a later date\". California-based Netflix reported profits of $53m (\u00a332m) in its most recent quarter. We're going to learn as we go\u201d Despite previous international launches - including the Netherlands last year and the UK in 2012 - the firm's revenue is mostly generated by US subscribers. Netflix's most recent   it had 11.8 million members paying for streaming content outside the US at the end of March but about three times that figure within the country. The firm has previously said that it became profitable in Canada within two years of launch, but has not released similar information about its other foreign ventures. However, chief executive Reed Hastings recently said the company recognised that it must tailor the content it provided to each audience. \"We've seen tremendous success in the Netherlands, where we launched six months ago, and that, I think, encourages us about being able to figure out the right programming formula in each nation,\" he  . \"We're going to learn as we go.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Director James Strong relives the moment the Manchester bomb exploded On 15 June 1996, the IRA detonated a 3,300lb bomb in Manchester city centre. That afternoon, England played Scotland in the Euro 1996 football championship. That day was the dawn of a new era, a BBC TV drama suggests. Eighteen years ago, James Strong was training as a television director at Granada in Manchester. That Saturday morning, he was heading into the city centre to go shopping. \"I think I might have been buying an England shirt to watch the game,\" he recalls. \"I was walking down Deansgate and I remember a boom. Suddenly, I saw all the windows at the bottom end of Deansgate start to blow out. \"Then I remember sort of falling over, and being on the floor, and thinking, 'How weird'. \"I got up and it was really quiet. Then all the alarms [went off]. You could tell something had happened but I thought a building had collapsed or something.\" Strong turned around and went to a friend's flat, where he learned it was actually an IRA lorry bomb. It was the second biggest IRA bomb on the British mainland. A warning had been received, meaning no-one died, but 200 people were injured and it devastated the city centre. Now Strong has returned to the city to direct three-part BBC One drama From There To Here, which uses that day as its starting point. \"To get the script 20 years later, I opened it up and read it and thought, 'Blimey, I've got a unique insight into this moment, and that period in Manchester,'\" says the director, who also worked on Broadchurch. From There To Here, which begins on Thursday, stars Philip Glenister as a man who escapes unscathed from the blast - but finds his personal life wrenched in an unexpected direction as a result. Bernard Hill plays his father, who runs the struggling family sweet factory, and Steven Mackintosh plays brother Robbo, a ducker-diver who is in deep trouble with Manchester gangs. The story jumps in time as the mini-series goes on - from the summer of 1996 to the political shift of the 1997 general election and finally the post-millennial hangover of 2000. Creator Peter Bowker, whose past writing credits include Blackpool and the Bafta-winning Occupation, says he got the idea after concluding that the financial meltdown of 2008 marked the end of an era of optimism in British life. \"So where did that period of optimism begin?\" he says. \"To my mind, anyway, that summer of '96 was the start of a kind of optimistic phase in British culture.\" Football \"came home\" as England hosted and reached the semi-finals of Euro '96. There was a confidence in British culture as Cool Britannia was in full swing and Blur and Oasis did battle in the charts. He chose classic Manchester songs for the soundtrack as well as commissioning I Am Kloot to write new incidental material. \"Manchester to me started when I was 16 and someone stuck a pair of Walkman headphones on and I heard the Stone Roses' debut album,\" he says. \"That was my first big musical love.  \"Having the Stone Roses open up the first episode is monumental to me. \"The Stone Roses is a symphonic sound. It's such a big sound and it does somehow encapsulate what Manchester's all about. \"Manchester and its music are completely intertwined - it's etched right through the skin of Manchester.\" A new political era was dawning, with New Labour on the verge of sweeping away 18 years of Conservative government. Hope was in the air. \"I realised there was almost an expectation,\" Bowker says. \"They were expectations that one way or another weren't delivered on.\" The hopes that were invested in the footballers, the musicians and the politicians all eventually evaporated, he says. As for the Manchester bomb, it wreaked havoc and destruction. But it was also the catalyst for the \u00a31.2bn regeneration of the city, a regeneration that may not have happened on such a scale without the intervention of the IRA. \"Over that summer, the event that we would think was the good thing was Euro '96,\" Bowker reflects. \"And lo and behold, that expectation has not been met because England haven't done well in a major tournament since. \"And the thing that we would say undoubtedly was the bad thing was the IRA bombing of Manchester. And yet its consequences, one would argue, have been fairly good. \"It's only with hindsight we can work out which were the events which were turning points for good or bad.\" The Manchester bomb was also a turning point for another reason. It was the last IRA bomb of its size on the British mainland and the Irish peace process led to the Good Friday Agreement two years later. And as the threat of Irish republican terrorism receded after June 1996, dark clouds appeared on another horizon as the attacks on 11 September 2001 left the Western world fearing Islamist attacks and led to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Bowker says: \"Even the [IRA] bomb seems strangely old-fashioned compared with what we've encountered since from terrorism. \"It was a bomb that seemed to be directed at buildings rather than people. It was very, very fortunate that it didn't kill people and that's no defence of it, but there seemed a slightly different tenor. So that alone... well, it's a different war.\" It has been 18 years since that day in 1996 and, watching the programme, it feels like a different age. \"What the drama is getting at is whatever era we find ourselves in, we rush to judgement in the present,\" Bowker says. \"It's only with hindsight that we can slowly start to unpick how we got there.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27469178", "title": ["TV drama From There To Here revisits 'optimism' of 1996"]},

{"article": "Foreign language TV dramas such as The Killing and Wallander have been surprise hits. As Britain warms to subtitles at the bottom of the screen, is it time for drama in sign language to shine?  For deaf people, the recent influx of foreign drama has been good news. They are screened in their original language with very good quality \"open\" subtitles for everybody, rather than via a button on the remote control. Contrast this with the regular subtitle service, which is often criticised as poor (and sometimes missing altogether) by deaf people.  Refreshingly it seems the thousands who watch Scandinavian dramas don't have a problem following a story by reading the screen. With that potential hurdle now cleared, perhaps drama in sign language could also go mainstream in the UK - if subtitled. You may not have caught it on the fringes of the schedules over the years, but the UK has had signed drama on TV before. What's more, there is something of a \"scene\" emerging around the world. Early sign language drama featured mostly deaf actors, was mostly signed and had little spoken dialogue.  is broadcast on BBC Two at 10:30 BST on Wednesdays - or catch up on  The Young and the Speechless, a wittily-named South African drama from the 90s was an example of this genre, as was the BBC Two soap Switch and Channel 4's Rush. The balance of deaf and hearing actors in these shows was roughly 80-90% in favour of deaf signers. They appealed to a core deaf audience who wanted to see themselves represented on screen in exactly the same way as hearing people. It wasn't an attempt at inclusion or integration, it was simply felt that hearing people were already served by dozens of weekly soap operas - so the spoken word was rarely heard. But not many hearing people watched. The comparative lack of spoken dialogue may have been off-putting. In foreign language dramas, hearing people can still listen to the characters and the rich intonations and inflections of each voice even if they can't understand them.  BBC Drama commissioner Ben Stephenson tells See Hear that there is no barrier to a drama being made in British Sign Language (BSL), as long as the script is good enough. He says: \"If someone came with a script like that and it was really good, I think we would probably leap up and down with excitement, because it's really hard to find great scripts.\" A more recent breed of drama for deaf people has a 50:50 balance of speaking and signing, a rich soundtrack and a mix of deaf and hearing actors. It appeals to a much wider audience as a result and, perhaps could join shows like The Bridge and Borgen in that Saturday night foreign drama slot. There are three of these hybrid sign/speech dramas that See Hear knows about at the moment. Most successful is teen drama Switched at Birth which airs in a primetime slot on ABC Family in the US. Now in its third season, it's not yet shown in the UK. Starring Oscar-winning deaf actress Marlee Matlin (Children of a Lesser God, The West Wing), the show has undoubtedly brought deaf culture and American Sign Language to a mainstream audience.  Making sign language and deafness part of the story, but not the whole story, feels like the key to deaf drama's future success. One criticism of Switched at Birth,  however, is the lack of deaf people working off screen, either on the writing team, as directors, or in the crew. As a result, some deaf people question its authenticity.  Scandinavia, where the UK's favourite foreign language dramas come from, is the home of two more dramas with signing at the core, also airing in primetime in their home countries.  Sweden's Inte Varre an Andra (No Worse Than Others) follows a crew making a documentary about a deaf family who are rather unusual. And in Norway's  (\"Rubbish Coffee\"), two men - one deaf, one hearing - are in a serious car accident which leaves them unconscious in intensive care. Their deaf and hearing families must figure out why they were travelling together in the first place. Instead of watercooler chats about Sarah Lund's jumper and people saying 'tak', perhaps we'll see a new craze for people learning BSL \u201d The hearing actors on both dramas offer the underplayed Nordic performances which audiences have come to love. They contrast nicely with the more expressive, physical acting of their deaf counterparts who, by necessity, communicate very visually via sign. And in a nod towards inclusivity, both the signing and the speaking are fully subtitled so the viewer can follow everything whether they are deaf or hearing in Sweden or Norway.  But if these foreign dramas were aired here in the UK, deaf audiences would have to read the subtitles for the signing - because Swedish and Norwegian sign languages are very different to BSL. The themes and concerns, however, would be universal to deaf people around the world, and appreciated as such. And hearing audiences might learn about deaf culture, picking up a sign here and there, and learning about such features of deaf life as lights flashing every time the doorbell rings.  Instead of watercooler chats about Sarah Lund's jumper and people saying \"tak\", perhaps we'll see a new craze for people learning BSL or creating sign names for each other while awaiting the latest episode of the new signed drama on BBC Four. But which country will it come from?  ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-27483176", "title": ["See Hear: Could deaf dramas be TV hits?"]},
{"article": "Timbuktu was one of the first films shown at this year's Cannes Film Festival and it remains one of the most praised. It's the work of director Abderrahmane Sissako, who grew up in Mali and it's the only film competing for the Palme d'Or made by an African director. Sissako says Timbuktu offers a warning about extremism - but it's also a touching personal drama. At 53, Abderrahmane Sissako is one of the few African directors with an international reputation. He was born in Mauritania but grew up across the border in Mali. His previous full-length film, in 2006, was Bamako, set in the Malian capital. Since then, Mali has been in the headlines mainly for the rise of hardline Islamists in the north and Sissako's new film addresses that phenomenon. In 2013, the French government launched Operation Serval, to counter al-Qaeda linked groups in northern Mali. The make-up and motivation of these groups is complex.   Abderrahmane Sissako says his idea initially was to make a documentary about the influence of groupings whose foreign members may include Libyans and Algerians.   \"But I think the documentary can be a difficult form,\" he says, speaking after his film's screening in Cannes.  \"I thought at first I could just go with my video camera and talk to people about what they think of foreigners telling them they're bad Muslims if they play football or sing or don't wear modest clothing.  \"Then I started to worry what might happen to them afterwards. The jihadists would find out what had been said so I realised no one would be free to speak their own mind.\" But the director admits he also had concerns for his own safety and that of his crew.   \"I planned to shoot in Mali. But when I was there for research there was a bombing in Timbuktu outside the army barracks and I worked out there could be a lot of disruption from the Islamists and maybe worse.  \"In the end the filming was almost all in Mauritania where the authorities were helpful. But we also shot for two days in Timbuktu.\" Timbuktu is beautifully photographed by Sofian El Fani, who filmed last year's Palme d'Or winner Blue is the Warmest Colour. The story is acted by a mix of professional performers and local people.  Kidane and Satima live a peaceful life tending their cattle, believing themselves safe from the extreme Islamists who have come to dominate the area.  Then Kidane takes a gun with him to argue with a fisherman about the killing of his best cow and a gripping tragedy ensues. \"I worry about Mali because I am a citizen of the world,\" says Sissako. \"The fact I grew up there is secondary. It's appalling that a group of people can turn up and transform Islamic society, which for centuries has been tolerant and kind, into something so intolerant.\" In the film, Arabic-speaking Islamists dominate local Tamasheq-speakers, in part simply by driving around toting their weaponry.  But Sissako says their initial foothold was made possible by faults in society in Mali and elsewhere in Africa. \"You can understand that, at first, some in Mali may have welcomed the jihadists. In a part of the world where people have no money and no work they played a social role and I try to show that in the film.  \"I didn't write the jihadists as monsters: some may be rash or hypocritical or may act out of self-interest but they are human beings.\" \"The fact is the government in Bamako had more or less abandoned northern Mali.  I didn't write the jihadists as monsters: some may be rash or hypocritical or may act out of self-interest but they are human beings\u201d \"I am certain some seeing the film will say, 'Where are the police?' and 'Why is no one keeping order?' But the jihadists took over because there was no social structure to keep them out. \"One of the reasons I made the film was to encourage Mali's rulers to do more to deal with the problem of the north. I was delighted the film was chosen to compete here in Cannes: it has focused attention on an area the outside world finds baffling and maybe tiresome.  \"The underlying problem is obvious and it's only the western world which can sort it out. Wealth is distributed completely unfairly around the world and that inequality creates areas of huge poverty such as Mali.  \"Dire poverty provided fertile ground for the groups we show in the film. None of that is very hard to understand. \"The international community is now spending tens of millions of euros in Timbuktu and Kidal and Gao. If that investment had come years ago, many of the problems in northern Mali could have been avoided.   \"It's a shameful failure by the west and of course it's not only in Mali. Just look at what's happening with Boko Haram in Nigeria: the details are different in each country but many of the same underlying problems are the same.\"  Yet Sissako's anger at the west shouldn't lead audiences to expect a political harangue on screen.  The film's achievement (and why it was met so warmly in Cannes) is that it's anything but a dry tract.  There's a charm to the performances and more humour than you would expect. The locations are attractive and, as tragedy takes hold, the story becomes genuinely moving. Timbuktu is a French production with a small amount of funding from Mauritania. But Abderrahmane Sissako says he's hopeful a more developed film industry will emerge in the region. \"It's another example of the lack of resources there. There are few film-making resources in that part of the world. In Mali, there are virtually none.   \"And there is almost nowhere in Mali to see a film either, even in the capital Bamako.  \"I would love Malians to watch Timbuktu but I just make the films.

The problem is it wouldn't really have a purpose,\" he says. \"The reason they brought it in was that Britain had garrisons all over the world - in Egypt, Malaya, Kenya and Malta - and they had to be manned. \"War today is much more specialised, the army is more technological, and robots are being developed so you won't really need soldiers at all. \"National Service would perhaps be a good thing, but not for the purpose of making soldiers. Were it to come back for a different and better purpose - like the Peace Corps in America, where they send the youth out to underdeveloped countries - there would be a reason for it.\" Having made films since the 1960s, Boorman has worked with a host of stars from Lee Marvin and Burt Reynolds to Pierce Brosnan, Brendan Gleason and TV's Kim Cattrall. Queen and Country, however, sees him marshalling a more fresh-faced, less experienced ensemble. Which does he find the easier? \"When I had my first child, I developed a theory about bringing up children,\" the director says by way of explanation. \"But when I had my second, I found I had to adapt and modify that theory. \"By the time I had four children\" - he has seven in all, among them actor and documentary-maker Charley - \"I gave up theory altogether. \"It's the same with actors. I used to have theories about how to deal with them, until I realised they are all different. \"They all need different things from me and different approaches.\" Boorman has a wealth of anecdotes and insights that makes any time spent in his company a pleasure. He also has robust views about Britain's class system and its royal family that suggests there probably won't be a knighthood heading his way, not that he'd be likely to accept it. All in all, meeting him was as good a way as any to round off nine hectic, eventful and exhilarating days at the world's biggest and craziest film festival. I'll leave you with this photo of myself on the steps of the Palais. Next time I'm up there, I hope to be wearing a tuxedo. The long road that took that movie to Oscar glory in 2012 began the previous year at Cannes, the first festival to embrace the French director's affectionate homage to silent cinema. This time, alas, Cannes may prove something of a dead end, judging by the half-hearted applause and audible boos that greeted his remake of a 1948 film of the same title. There were even a few jeering whistles during this morning's press screening, suggesting some critics had made their mind up on its merits long before the end credits. Set in the aftermath of World War II, the original Search saw Montgomery Clift as an American soldier who set out to reunite a lost Czech boy with his mother. Hazanavicius updates the story to 1999 and the second Chechen War, using the plight of an orphaned nine-year-old refugee as a far-from-subtle symbol of the West's widespread indifference to the conflict. Berenice Bejo - aka Mrs Hazanavicius - plays an EU delegate who takes the boy under her wing while trying to alert Strasbourg to the carnage on its doorstep. Meanwhile, a young Russian private finds soldiering is not what it is cracked up to be, setting up a climactic twist you do not have to be psychic to see coming. Earnest, mawkish and punishingly slow, this two-and-a-half hour slog boasts some impressive battle sequences but feels like one long preach to the already converted. It's the last film I will see during my stint in Cannes, and one that sadly confirms my overall impression that this has been far from a vintage year. Only in Cannes can you get a critical pasting one minute and a standing ovation the next. That was the lot of Canadian actor Ryan Gosling on Tuesday, the day his directorial debut was unveiled to expectant festival audiences. The 33-year-old star of Drive and The Notebook appeared genuinely humbled to be given such a high-profile launching pad for his film Lost River. \"It's a huge honour to be invited here,\" he told the audience last night. \"It's an incredible opportunity to show a film in a theatre like this.\" Long before Gosling mounted the Debussy Theatre's steps with cast members Christina Hendricks and Matt Smith, however, the word was out that the RyGo was a no-no. \" \", \" \", \" \" and \" \" were just some of the adjectives used to describe a drama generally felt to be overly indebted to the likes of David Lynch, Terrence Malick and Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn. While some reviewers gave Gosling credit for his ambition, just as many said he had overreached himself on his first stint behind the camera. Back at the Debussy, none of that seemed to matter to an largely enthusiastic crowd happy to bask in the actor's reflected glory. It made me wonder what one has to do not to get a standing ovation at Cannes. Hmm... not be a Hollywood A-lister maybe? Lost River was originally named How to Catch a Monster, a rather more evocative title than the bland one it has now. Then again, the title is the least of its problems. Rather more pressing is the overall lack of coherence and a story that's deathly dull even when it's trying to be intensely perverse. Set in a ruined city clearly modelled on Detroit, it tells of a single mother (Mad Men actress Hendricks) who takes a job in a nightclub to make ends meet. Little does she know her position requires her to participate in kinky sexual role-plays, often at the behest of her manipulative financial advisor (Ben Mendelsohn). Meanwhile, the oldest of her two sons (Iain De Caestecker) falls on the wrong side of local thug Bully after thieving on his patch. The villain is played by Smith as a hollering Looney Tune capable of extreme acts of violence - a role the actor shaved his head for shortly after leaving Doctor Who last year. The combined star wattage of Gosling and Smith should help Lost River find an audience when it is released in the UK later this year. For now though, it's already been chalked up as another of this Cannes Film Festival's high-profile disappointments. I'd heard such good things about Whiplash from when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January that I was worried it wouldn't live up to my high expectations. To my delight it did, and more. Not only is Damien Chazelle's music-based drama the best thing I've seen at Cannes, I already suspect it will be the best film I'll see all year. Set in New York, it tells of a budding jazz drummer (Miles Teller) who comes under the tutelage of a dictatorial martinet of a music teacher (JK Simmons). Imagine the drill instructors from Full Metal Jacket, An Officer and a Gentleman and Aliens rolled into one and you're still nowhere close to this ruthless, foul-mouthed tyrant. The jazz is sensational, the editing astonishing and it all climaxes on a musical high so extraordinary you can only applaud. (And trust me, you will.) Teller is fabulous but this is Simmons' film - and a just reward after many years of selfless supporting roles in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies and others. \"No one can make the word [expletive] sound as good as JK,\" said Chazelle after Tuesday's directors' fortnight screening. \"There are some people who can curse really well and create poetry out of very coarse language. \"He was the only person in American film today who could sell it both comically and dramatically and give it the right rhythm I needed.\" \"I will confess there are aspects of Terence Fletcher with which I empathise,\" said Simmons of a role I can easily see landing him his first Oscar nomination. If this sounds like extravagant praise, I assure you it is not. Whiplash hasn't got a confirmed release date in the UK yet, but you should definitely seek it out when it does. Belgian siblings Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne are two-time winners of the Palme d'Or, so it is no surprise to see them in competition again this year.  Yet where 1999's Rosetta and 2005's The Child both told stories of the struggling underclass, Two Days, One Night tries something different by turning its gaze on the more rarefied concerns of Belgium's aspirant middle-classes.  Marion Cotillard plays Sandra, an employee at a solar panel factory who learns she will lose her job unless her co-workers opt to give up a \u20ac1,000 bonus.  Over the course of one weekend, she visits each of them in turn in the hope of pricking their collective social consciousnesses with her personal tale of woe. The film echoes the work of Britain's Ken Loach with its earnest call for solidarity in the workplace and its barely concealed disgust at how employers divide and rule their underlings.  But the Dardennes rather tip the scales by having Sandra also plagued by marital difficulties and a history of depression that is used rather cynically to sway the audience's sympathies.  Cotillard is great as ever and is surely a strong contender for this year's best actress award with a performance of dignity, grit and tenacity.  Sadly, there is only so much drama to be found in her making the same plaintive argument over and over again, resulting in a film that's more repetitive than revealing and feels considerably longer than its 95-minute running time. Speaking of professional solidarity, the lights came up at the Grand Theatre Lumiere on a furious row on the rights and wrongs of using one's mobile phone during an early morning press screening.  I wouldn't expect many tears to be shed should the inconsiderate miscreant responsible find himself facing redundancy any time soon. After a blisteringly warm weekend, locals and visitors alike in Cannes woke up on Monday morning to wet and windy weather that persisted all the way to nightfall. I shudder to think how many beach bashes were wash-outs as a result of conditions which sent many festival-goers taking shelter inside whatever cinema could accommodate them. I followed suit after fulfilling my press conference duties, catching three films back-to-back which proves how much variety is on offer at this south of France shindig. I started my triple bill with Bird People, a whimsical French film playing in the Un Certain Regard part of the official programme. Set in and around a hotel at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, Pascale Ferran's curio tells a pair of complementary stories that share themes of ennui, alienation and disenchantment with modern society. In the first more conventional half, a San Jose businessman (Josh Charles from US TV series The Good Wife) decides on a whim to quit his job, abandon his family and start a new life in Europe. In the second more fanciful section, a young maid named Audrey (Anais Demoustier) is miraculously turned into a sparrow and spends a joyous night flying around the airport's runways and terminals. Given the likelihood of it being crushed underfoot or sucked into a jet engine, you'd think an airport would be the last place any self-respecting sparrow would choose to frequent. After watching Welcome to New York the other night though, I was only happy Audrey didn't go in to clean a hotel room and find Gerard Depardieu emerging priapically from the shower. I've been somewhat remiss on the documentary front this festival - an oversight I sought to address by catching a screening of Caricaturistes (Cartoonists in English). Directed by Stephanie Valloatto, this out of competition offering meets 12 \"dessinateurs\" from around the world who have all encountered resistance to their political satire and lampooning of the powerful. The film's subtitle proclaims them to be \"Foot Soldiers of Democracy\" who do a noble job holding their leaders to account and, when required, cutting them down to size. Zipping between South America, the Middle East and various other locales, it's an interesting, thought-provoking watch. I would have thought that our own Gerald Scarfe deserved a mention though. My final catch of the day was When Animals Dream, a Danish horror set in a remote fishing community that reminded me a lot of the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In. Where that film's young female heroine was a vampire, this one's is a werewolf whose hairy makeover is triggered by her sexual awakening. \"I'm about to turn into a monster, but first I need a lot of sex. Are you able to help me?\" asks Marie (Rooney Mara-alike Sonia Suhl) of one victim in waiting. It's all rather formulaic but I still found it enjoyable - not least for having Lars Mikkelsen, brother of my mate Mads, as part of its cast. Today is my last full day in Cannes and there is a lot going on. Keep checking back in over the next 24 hours, when I will hopefully have news on the new film from the Dardenne brothers, John Boorman's sequel to Hope and Glory and Ryan Gosling's eagerly anticipated directorial debut. Phew! What does a world-famous director do with all the glittering trophies he accumulates over the course of his long career? If you're Canadian film-maker David Cronenberg, you use them in your work as murder weapons. At a press conference on Monday for his new film Maps to the Stars, the 71-year-old horror maestro revealed he gave the golden Genie award he won for 2002 film Spider a cameo role - as a blunt instrument used by one character to bludgeon another to death. \"It was a personal touch,\" the silver-haired auteur joked, going on to recall that the statuette had got bent in the process. Robert Pattinson was also in a sharing mood, telling journalists that his on-screen sex scene with co-star Julianne Moore had been \"a wonderful experience\" - albeit an \"extremely sweaty\" one. The 28-year-old is making a habit of simulating sex in limousines, having also been intimate with Juliette Binoche in Cronenberg's earlier film Cosmopolis. So who was the better partner, he was inevitably asked?  \"Both are, like, sevens,\" he answered charitably. Foxcatcher tells the strange but troublingly true story of an Olympic gold medal-winning wrestler; the older brother who coached him to glory; and the wealthy heir who came between them and changed their lives forever.  It boasts a completely atypical, dead-straight turn from comedy star Steve Carrell, a remarkably physical one from Channing Tatum and a dramatic conclusion you should ideally discover for yourselves.  Director Bennett Miller previously enjoyed great success with Capote and Moneyball and looks set to be in the running for awards again with this compelling and unusual sports-based drama.  If nothing else, Foxcatcher surely deserves a prize for best supporting nose for the astonishing fake proboscis Carell sports in his role as inscrutable billionaire philanthropist John du Pont. At a press conference held after this morning's first screening, Carell said his approach to the role had been no different from his more familiar comic parts.  \"The characters don't know if they're in a comedy or a drama,\" shrugged the Anchorman man. \"So I didn't approach it as a drama - just as a story.\"  Meanwhile, his co-star Mark Ruffalo - who plays wrestling coach Dave Schultz - had this to say on the film's key themes. \"There's a Greek tragedy buried in the film. What happens when everything has a price tag and everything is for sale? What happens to talent when it can be acquired for a price, and what happens to the people within that system?  \"These are very talented people who can't do what they do best unless they can find a way to monetise it. And that costs them a great deal.\"  Foxcatcher is up for the Palme d'Or and will be out in the UK later this year.  Its title, by the way, refers to the wrestling team Carell's character forms in the hope of seeing Tatum mount the podium at the 1988 Seoul Olympics Two years ago David Cronenberg and Robert Pattinson came to Cannes with Cosmopolis, an odd film in which the latter spent virtually all of his time inside a stretch limousine. Now the duo are back, and so is the limo, in Palme d'Or hopeful Maps to the Stars. This time though, Pattinson is driving the car instead of riding in it. In truth, the actor's role as a chauffeur with ambitions to better his station is a fairly minor one in this dark Hollywood satire. But he does get to romance Mia Wasikowska, the new girl in town whose facial burns hint at a tragic personal history. Mia gets a job as an assistant - the phrase used here is \"chore whore\" - to Julianne Moore's narcissistic star, a fading leading lady desperate to return to the big time. Moore's is a pretty despicable character in a caustic vision of Tinseltown that is sure to strike a chord with many of this year's festival attendees. To my mind, Maps to the Stars begins to lose its way once it stops taking the movie industry to task and becomes a hallucinatory psychodrama about creeping insanity. This may well be a minority opinion though. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw   in his four-star review, while the Telegraph's Robbie Collin believes   the festival's highest honour. The film, which also features John Cusack and Olivia Williams as the parents of a Bieber-esque child actor (Evan Bird), has its official press conference and gala premiere later. Two days on, I still find myself thinking of Eric Cantona's performance in The Salvation, that gritty western I saw on Friday. What made the Danish director Kristian Levring cast the former soccer player, a man still best-known in the UK for his karate kicks and gnomic, seagull-related utterances?  \"Eric can act,\" grins the burly Dane. \"Not many footballers can act, but Eric can. \"I'm also a Manchester United fan, so to work with 'King Eric'... well, you don't get to do that too many times in your life.\" \"Eric is special,\" the film-maker continues. \"I mean, I love [Lionel] Messi, but I wouldn't have him in my film.\" \"Cantona is an idol,\" agrees The Salvation's star, former Bond villain Mads Mikkelsen. \"All male actors wanted to be soccer players before they became actors, so we were all very excited when he came.\" Speaking of westerns, there's another one having its Cannes premiere tonight. Tommy Lee Jones directs and stars alongside Hilary Swank in The Homesman, a film I hope to catch up with before I mosey on home on Wednesday. Two manic media scrums in the space of 12 hours is two too many for this reporter. But that's what I and my colleagues faced, first at the Welcome to New York screening last night and then at the   earlier today. The former was held in a giant tent on the beach, with a loud and exuberant party taking place a stone's throw away. I joked to director Abel Ferrara as I left around midnight that perhaps every post-screening Q&A at Cannes should be held in a nightclub. I experienced a journalistic nightmare this lunchtime when I realised to my horror that I had left my notepad at the Carlton Hotel after the Expendables press conference. Hot-footing it back along the Croisette, I found it exactly where I left it - which says something about either the commendable honesty of the international press corps or the woeful illegibility of my handwriting. I'll just say a word here about It Follows, a creepy and creative US horror film that I caught on Saturday afternoon. Playing as part of the Critics' Week sidebar, it's an inventive and unsettling piece about a teenage girl who finds herself inheriting a curse after a one night stand. Finding herself pursued by a shape-shifting zombie stalker, Jay (Maika Monroe) realises that the only way to save her skin is to pass it on to her next sexual partner. Zombies are usually a metaphor for something in movies. Here, it seems they represent the dangers of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. One of the quirkier attractions of Cannes is the Palm Dog, a tongue-in-cheek awards ceremony that celebrates canine performers at the festival. Decided by a panel of UK film critics, the awards have previously recognised the likes of Uggie in The Artist, Dug from the Pixar animation Up, and the titular lead in The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby. There are a number of mutts in The Rover, a thriller set in the Australian Outback starring Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson. To be honest, though, I'm not sure if its title refers to a dog, Pearce himself or the stolen automobile his taciturn loner spends all of David Michod's film trying to recover. Pattinson plays a stammering, twitchy simpleton with close-cropped hair and terrible teeth who joins Pearce on his obsessive quest. It's a bold volte face for the British star that seems a deliberate attempt to put some distance between himself and the Twilight series for which he is best known. The real star of The Rover, however, is the Outback itself - an arid, dusty and forbidding environment in which bad things happen constantly and no one is to be trusted. Released in the UK this August, The Rover is playing out of competition and has its gala premiere later.  Mike Leigh had some sharp words - and a two-fingered salute - to the \"Turner-aks\" who might object to how JMW Turner is portrayed in his new film about the painter. \"The real Turner nuts haven't seen it yet,\" he told an audience at the UK Film tent this afternoon. \"But we've already ordered some protective armour. \"There are bound to be some complainers,\" the director continued. \"But they can [expletive] off.\" As I departed the event, who should I see but Donald Sutherland and Julianne Moore walking out of an adjacent marquee. Wherever you are, you're never too far from a star at the Cannes Film Festival. Ugly Betty star America Ferrara looked radiant last night at the beach party for How to Train a Dragon 2 in a billowing, beaded white gown. Earlier in the evening, though, she and that gown were the victims of a rather unsavoury stunt as she posed with her fellow voice stars on the Cannes red carpet. A Ukrainian prankster thought it would be funny if he stuck his head under the 30-year-old actress's dress while she was turned towards photographers. The man, who apparently makes a habit of placing celebrities in awkward situations, was pounced upon by security guards and swiftly ejected. Before the Dragon 2 event, I returned to the tent where I'd   earlier on Friday to watch singer Tony Hadley perform a brief acoustic set with guitarist Steve Norman. Their performance ended with a lusty rendition of the anthemic track Gold that all assembled, myself included, had great fun singing along to as the sun set. Mads Mikkelsen as a barefoot cowboy. Eva Green as a vengeful mute. Eric Cantona as a gun-toting Old West heavy. Yes, it is fair to say Kristian Levring's bloody western The Salvation has one of the more unusual casts to be found in this year's festival programme. I knew I was in for a violent morning from the first 10 minutes, during which Mads' Danish war veteran turned frontier settler loses both his wife and young son to a couple of stagecoach-hijacking scoundrels. Needless to say, these are far from the only corpses to be found in a beautifully shot saga of revenge and retribution that even comes with its own undertaker (Jonathan Pryce). The Salvation is screening out of competition. Were it to be in the running, though, it would have a much better chance of taking home the Palme d'Or than, say, Atom Egoyan's The Captive. As it is, the film will have a \"seance special\" on Saturday at half past midnight. Personally, I think I'll be tucked up in bed by then. There was more blood and thunder this lunchtime from British stalwarts Film 4, who treated a select group of journalists to a \"sizzle reel\" of its upcoming projects. It included a tantalising glimpse of Michael Fassbender in Macbeth, which on this evidence looks to be Shakespeare spliced liberally with Mel Gibson's Braveheart. The Fass sports a hedge of face fur and a physiognomy smeared with mud in what is shaping up to be a highly visceral and intense take on the Bard's Scottish tragedy. Is this a hit I see before me? I wouldn't be surprised. Lady M, for the record, is played by France's Marion Cotillard, who will be seen later this festival in competition entry Two Days, One Night. Animation has the stigma of being just for the kids\u201d Every Cannes Film Festival boasts at least one potential Hollywood blockbuster in its line-up - perhaps to prove that, for all its focus on the high-brow and art-house, it still has time for what audiences tend to spend their money on. This year, that slot is filled by How to Train Your Dragon 2, the latest animation from the DreamWorks stable that brought the likes of Kung Fu Panda, Puss in Boots and A Shark Tale to previous events. DreamWorks has a tradition of mounting elaborate photo opportunities to promote its wares - flanking Jack Black with an army of pandas for example, or putting Jerry Seinfeld on a zip wire in a bee costume. This year the tradition was maintained by having the voice stars of the film pose beside a local stooge, sweltering inside an outsized dragon costume. One can only hope he was paid to scale (ho ho). DreamWorks Animation will celebrate its 20th anniversary later this year - one reason why How to Train Your Dragon 2 has been invited to screen outside of competition. According to its director and writer, however, animation has more than earned its place at this annual celebration of international auteur film-making. \"I constantly think that animation is gaining ground, not only in terms of worldwide appreciation but also within the industry itself,\" Dean DeBlois told me yesterday. \"The sophisticated, film-going snobs are beginning to see some of the potential within the medium. \"Too often, particularly in north America, animation has the stigma of being just for the kids. I think it's a medium that can speak to a much bigger audience than that. \"Hopefully that's coming across to the film-making community at large. Just because it's an animated film, it shouldn't be relegated to the kiddie table.\" The last time I saw Ryan Reynolds on screen was at the Sundance London Film Festival. It was a film called The Voices, and he was playing a schizophrenic serial killer who took orders from his speaking cat.  If anything, The Captive - the Cannes competition entry in which he appears - is even more preposterous. Reynolds plays the father of a kidnapped child who has spent eight years trying to track her down with the help of a police detective, played by Rosario Dawson.  What follows is a lurid hotchpotch of sophisticated paedophiles and hi-tech criminality that drew a jeering response at the end of this morning's press screening. I'd been hoping for more from Canadian director Atom Egoyan. Like many others though, I left disappointed. Here's hoping the rest of the day pans out better. I spent part of today on the seventh floor of Cannes' famous Carlton Hotel, doing some interviews I'll tell you more about tomorrow ... For now, here is a snap of me hard at work on the balcony, just to prove that I'm here. The festival is in full swing after last night's gala opening, with no sign of the rain that put something of a dampener on things on Tuesday and Wednesday. There's precious little time, then, to top up one's tan, for all the apparent evidence to the contrary. As I write stars are arriving at the Grand Theatre Lumiere for the Mr Turner premiere, among them Julianne Moore. The US actress will be back on the red carpet on Monday for Maps to the Stars, the David Cronenberg film in which she has a starring role. \"Nothing exists in isolation,\" says a character in Mr Turner, Mike Leigh's affecting portrait of the 19th century English artist Joseph Mallord William Turner. The film takes this observation to heart, showing its subject as a gifted yet flawed man whose genius springs out of his relationship to his society, surroundings and relationships, particularly with women. There are actually two Mister Turners here - Timothy Spall as the artist, and Paul Jesson as his father, a former barber whose decline and death foreshadows Turner's own. For this is a film as interested in mortality as the immortality that Turner now enjoys, through the art he bequeathed to the nation and the prize that bears his name. Leigh shows the artist at work: Sketching obsessively, daubing feverishly and occasionally using his spittle as a paint thinner. Yet he also depicts him as man of baser instincts, who is not above seducing a needy widow or groping his housekeeper - a shuffling, almost Dickensian dogsbody memorably portrayed by Dorothy Atkinson. Around them circulate what seems like a who's who of Victorian notables - artist John Constable, critic John Ruskin and even Queen Victoria herself. Yet it is Spall who dominates as a cantankerous, grumpy curmudgeon capable of expressing a wealth of emotion in a single, exasperated grunt. Some will find Mr Turner somewhat leisurely, if not downright slow. Like Topsy Turvy before it, though, it shows Leigh to be as adept at chronicling real lives as he is at depicting fictional ones. Director of photography Dick Pope, meanwhile, does a grand job at recreating the images that inspired Turner, notably the Fighting Temeraire - a picture of a once great ship being towed away for scrap that recently made a cameo in the James Bond film Skyfall. Throw a stick in Cannes and you are more than likely to hit somebody with a connection to the film industry. A nice American woman asked me for directions to the Palais de Festivals this morning. In return, I got a five-minute pitch about the World War 2 film she has written, co-directed, starred in and in town to promote. Oh, and the man who buttonholed me on yesterday's flight over from Gatwick to advertise the virtues of East Grinstead as a potential movie location.  Now that's dedication. The critics have not been kind to Grace of Monaco, with one British reviewer going so far as to term it  . Having had the chance to see the film in London last week, I have to say I have a similarly low opinion of Olivier Dahan's soapy biopic. Little rings true in this melodramatic endeavour, least of all Sir Derek Jacobi as an expert in protocol who becomes Henry Higgins to Nicole Kidman's fair princess. Kidman herself does her best to put flesh on Grace's bones. Unfortunately, she brings too much of her own celebrity baggage to convince as an icon from another era. What can't be faulted, though, is the film's lavish costume and production design. It truly is a feast for the eyes with its fine gowns and expensive jewellery. And I have to confess that I rather enjoyed Tim Roth's turn as a largely silent, perpetually chain-smoking Prince Rainier. When I spoke to the British actor last year, he had this to say about playing Grace's husband: \"There's not much out there about Rainier. People don't have much of a perception about him, so we had a pretty free rein. \"But we wanted some toughness in him because he was known to be a very tough guy. He was very smart politically and could be very tough in a room. \"He fought in a war and was quite handy and he was a very shrewd businessman. So he was an interesting character to play, with a very funny moustache!\" The actor was somewhat bemused at the film's press conference earlier when he was asked if he had ever been tempted to hit his co-star during shooting. More than one eyebrow was raised when Grace of Monaco was chosen to be the opening night film at Cannes this year. French director Olivier Dahan and US producer Harvey Weinstein have been at loggerheads for months over the film's final cut, prompting the latter to remove it from its release schedule and,  , consider dumping it altogether. Monaco's royal family, meanwhile, has greeted the film's dramatisation of Grace Kelly's transition from Hollywood star to Monegasque princess with withering disdain, declaring its story to be \" \". The film has its gala premiere later. Before that, though, the critics will have their say. The reviews are expected around noon Cannes time, once this morning's official press screening is over. Looking ahead, the festival's organisers have announced this year's event will close in 11 days with a special screening of Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. Quentin Tarantino will host the 24 May celebration of the 1964 classic, one of the first \"spaghetti westerns\" and the film that made Clint Eastwood an international star. In the meantime, normal service has resumed on the weather front: balmy temperatures, blazing sunshine and cloudless, azure skies. Perfect, in other words, for sitting in darkened rooms for hours on end watching one film after another. In my experience, sun can usually be guaranteed at the Cannes Film Festival. Yet new arrivals on the Croisette today were greeted by buffeting gusts, sharp showers and glowering clouds more reminiscent of a wet weekend in Margate. Here's hoping it's just the storm before the calm. With the festival kicking off tomorrow, the atmosphere is one of nervous excitement and frantic, last-minute preparations. I trust they'll get round to laying a red carpet on the steps of the Grand Theatre Lumiere, which, at the moment, look rather naked without it. Yet, they have found time to drape the usual, enormous billboards over the hotel frontages that overlook the Mediterranean. The Carlton, for example, has massive representations of Sylvester Stallone, Harrison Ford and other cast members from The Expendables 3 ahead of their planned visit this weekend. Other displays bang the drum for Angelina Jolie's Maleficent, the new Transformers film and the next entry in the Hunger Games franchise. The one that caught my eye, though, is for a film called Awol 72, an action thriller starring Luke Goss of Bros fame. According to the poster tagline, \"Running is the only option\". Well, I suppose that's one way of putting it. ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27325505", "title": ["Cannes 2014: Reporter's diary"]},

{"article": "As the British Library puts huge swathes of writers' and poets' personal archives online on their   site, including papers from Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy and Charles Dickens, novelist Lawrence Norfolk looks at the significance of the notebook to a writer.  The first page of my notebook holds a column of place names, some cuneiform letters taken from a tomb in the British Library and a collection of oddly-named English meadow flowers (wet-the-bed, yellow rattle, adder's tongue fern).  Turning the page, I find a list of books with library numbers from the British or London libraries, then caravan names (Sprite, Lunar, the Senator range) then some players of un-credited guitar solos: Eric Clapton on When my Guitar Gently Weeps, Brian May on a Black Sabbath track, a few others. Turning to the back, I write the word Letter. I am travelling on a German train between Hannover and Osnabruck. Letter is the name of the station through which I have just passed.  The next is Haste. I write that too. What, I wonder, if the name of every station on the line turns out to be cognate with English words? What if the stations form a sentence? A paragraph? Unfortunately, the next station is Gummer. A writer's notebook is a junkyard; a junkyard of the mind. In this repository of failed attempts, different inks speak of widely-spaced times and places, the diverse scrawls of varying levels of calligraphic awkwardness, lack of firm writing-surfaces, different modes of transportation.  All the places a good idea might blossom into something bigger and better.  No writer should believe in serendipity. All of us do. Thomas Hardy kept 'literary notebooks', a 'Poetical Matter' notebook and a 'Studies, Specimens, etc' notebook. But the richest to my mind is one with the bare title, 'Facts'.  Here Hardy and his first wife, Emma, noted down incidents culled from local newspapers. One entry (barely three lines long) is headed Sale of Wife. Out of that fragment came The Mayor of Casterbridge.  Of course, almost everything else in the Facts notebook resulted in nothing at all. A notebook is an act of triage on the world outside. A little 'fact' goes a long way in fiction. My German train slides past the backs of factories, blocks of flats and houses. Heading out into the countryside, I see two imposing hills.  Halfway up the nearest slope, a large statue stands within a structure that resembles an ancient Greek bandstand.  The statue will be some comically-obscure German official. The Elector-Palatinate of Gummer perhaps. I note down the nearest station and make a bad ink-sketch of the bandstand. Then I arrive at Osnabruck. Franz Kafka wrote in quarto-sized notebooks before trading down to octavo near the end of his life. Jean-Jacques Rousseau made notes on playing cards during walks that were later written up as his Reveries of a Solitary Walker.  I make notes on library slips, envelopes, junk mail, whatever's lying about. All these scraps end up shoved into notebooks.  I'm not particular about brands (the moleskin is high-end for me), only size, specifically whether they require a pocket or a bag, and how much I can get on one page.  The research for my book Lempriere's Dictionary was written in spiral-bound shorthand notepads, filled with notes on classical mythology, late eighteenth century newspaper reports, clothes descriptions, weather reports, ship catalogues, details of the siege of La Rochelle and early automata.  Later I switched to larger format books. These were between A4 and A3 size and the obvious drawback was portability but I lugged these volumes back and forth to libraries nevertheless.  At first I simply jotted stuff down as before but gradually I noticed that my note-taking had changed. With this new expanse of space, certain pages would take on their own momentum.  A map of Himmelbett German radar stations began life as research for a scene in which a German World War II night-fighter pilot flies his newly-delivered Messerschmitt Bf-109 E-series (an Emil in the slang of the time) down the coast of Holland, accidentally setting off alerts among the different Himmelbett radar stations which monitored the coast against English bombers.  These stations divided the airspace into sectors of operation (or boxes) which were code-named for different animals and fish. I had in mind a German fighter pilot flying through an airborne zoo.  I collected these box code-names from the memoirs of German night-fighter pilots who would routinely refer to flying and making contact in Lobster or Oyster or Polar Bear.  Then I collated these references on a map to discover which box the particular creature referred to.  I never wrote the scene. But long after I'd abandoned the idea, I was still collecting Himmelbett box code-names and fitting them into my plan.  Similar projects (in the same book) include a table (eventually, several tables) of the sound shifts which mark stages in the development of Middle High German, plans for a radio transmitter using only technology available in the fourth century AD and a catalogue (still being compiled) of books which once existed but now have vanished. No sensible writer intends projects like these. At the same time, no writer using a notebook can guard fully against them. They just happen.  A notebook accumulates its value slowly, line by line and page by page. Like Hardy's Wife for Sale, who knows what will prove a dead-end and what the inspiration or material for a book?  A detail jotted down in two minutes might occupy you for the next three years. The protagonist of your next book might turn out to be the Elector-Palatinate of Gummer.  A full notebook potentially contains the rest of your writing life. Or nothing of value at all. It is transitional. Work passes through it on the way to becoming something else.  I used the caravan list in a short story about two lovers not quite falling apart during an impromptu visit to Little Rollright (the easternmost stone circle in Britain, also from the notebook). The un-credited guitar soloists went into that story too.  Of the remainder, I don't know. Not the railway station names anyway. And I never found the identity of the statue, the Elector-Palatinate or whoever he was. I got off at Osnabruck. I left the notebook on the train.

{"article": "Broadchurch was the night's biggest winner at the Bafta TV Awards, but plenty more had reason to celebrate. Here is a taste of what went on backstage at London's Theatre Royal Drury Lane:  As award shows go, this one delivered its fair share of drama. US drug series Breaking Bad became the first online-only show in the UK to win a TV Bafta.  Olivia Colman followed her double win last year by scooping the leading actress prize for Broadchurch. And the IT Crowd proved that geeks can be cool with comedy acting wins for its stars Katherine Parkinson and Richard Ayoade. The first winner of the night was Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. The Geordie duo returned to the stage towards the end of the night when they won best  entertainment performance for the same show.  Speaking backstage about their long TV partnership, Declan Donnelly said: \"It's not like work for us. We live a couple of doors away from each other, we drive into work together, even on our days off we play golf together.   \"It's like a dream. I get to go to work everyday with my best mate.\"  The mini-series award went to BBC Three zombie drama In The Flesh, which stars Luke Newberry - a best actor nominee - as a teenager with Partially Deceased Syndrome. BBC Three's Him and Her: The Wedding was named best sitcom - making it two wins for the TV channel that is being axed to become an exclusively online outlet, accessible via the BBC iPlayer.  In The Flesh director Jonny Campbell noted that online-only shows like House of Cards and Breaking Bad didn't \"look like their budgets were cut to go online\".  Media requires JavaScript to play. ITV's Broadchurch was the big Bafta winner with awards for best drama, best actress and best supporting actor Asked about the BBC Three closure, Kenton Allen, the executive producer of Him and Her, said: \"I think winning Baftas in amongst all this competition from terrestrial channels might make some people think again, but I doubt whether it will have an impact on the decision.\"  The BBC won four awards in total.  As well as those two wins for BBC Three, Sarah Lancashire beat co-star Nicola Walker to win best supporting actress for BBC One's Last Tango in Halifax, while the public-voted Radio Times audience award went to Doctor Who's 50th anniversary episode Day of the Doctor.  Backstage, an emotional Lancashire said she had made a \"biggest faux pas ever\" by forgetting to thank Tango writer Sally Wainwright, whom she praised as \"an extraordinary talent\". Channel 4 and ITV took home eight awards each.  Channel 4 had gone to the Bafta ceremony with a total of 27 nominations - the most of any single channel this year.  BBC One and BBC Two had 17 apiece, while ITV had 12. Sky, meanwhile, converted all of its three nominations into wins. David Attenborough's Natural History Museum Alive 3D won specialist factual; The Ashes 2013 - 1st Test, Day 5 took home the sport award; and A League of Their Own won best comedy entertainment programme.   Coronation Street's cancer plotline involving Hayley Cropper helped the long-running show win the soap award.  Actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, who played Hayley, said: \"Walking around in the street, people felt the need to talk to us about it.\"  More than 10 million viewers tuned in to watch her character take her own life to end the pain of terminal cancer in a controversial plot in January. \"I thought people weren't going to be able to handle it. But it seemed that a lot of people got a lot of solace... seeing it reflected in this way.\" Breaking Bad, shown exclusively online in the UK on Netflix, won the international award after a change in the rules allowed shows screened online to be eligible.  It beat Danish political drama Borgen, French supernatural chiller The Returned and Netflix stablemate House of Cards.  The show, about a terminally ill chemistry teacher who turns drug lord, came to an end last year.  \"I do believe it's one of the greatest TV shows ever made,\" said Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul who was there to pick up the Bafta. So if those were the winners, who missed out?  The Great British Bake Off - which had twice won the features category - failed to make it a hat-trick when it was beaten by ITV's Long Lost Family, presented by Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell. And there was no joy for Dominic West or Helena Bonham Carter, stars of BBC Four biopic Burton and Taylor, who were up for the leading actor and actress prizes.  The best actor prize instead went to Southcliffe's Sean Harris who praised his drama teacher for inspiring him to become an actor.  \"I could have ended up in a chicken factory,\" he elaborated backstage. The reality show win for Channel 4's Gogglebox - which features people watching TV shows in their living rooms - could throw up an unusual scenario later this week.  Friday's edition is set to feature the televised Bafta awards ceremony, which means the TV watchers will be commenting on their own show for the first time.  \"It'll be a bit weird, a bit eating itself\" said executive producer Tania Alexander. \"But it'll be interesting to see what we get.\" ", "subject": "Entertainment_and_Arts", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27465253", "title": ["Bafta TV awards: the view backstage"]}]
