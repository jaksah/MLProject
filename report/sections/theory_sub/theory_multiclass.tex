\subsection{Multi-Class Problem}
Classifiers like \nb\ and \svm\ are binary classifiers, separating two classes. For a multi-class problem the strategy \emph{One-Vs-The-Rest} is used which creates one classifier for each target class. Then for each classifier fit the feature vector to that class vs not that class. The classifier with highest confidence will be the final class of the feature vector.
