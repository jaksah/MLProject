\mn\ \nb\ proved to be the most suitable classifier for the task of classifying news articles of eight different classes, since is obtained the highest hit ratio and had a good overall performance for different datatypes.

It would be of interest as future work to do an investigation of how the \rf\ classifier behaves if the data is evenly balanced between the classes. For further reading in the field of very imbalanced data, see \cite{Chen}.
\\\\
Future work would include analyzing different pruning techniques, e.g. TF-IDF which emphasizes words that are unique for a document and suppress the value of common words among all documents.
