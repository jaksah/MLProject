	\begin{itemize}
		\item Random forest is sensitive to uneven spread of data between topics. Probably needs same amount of each
		\item SVM handles increase in vocabulary size well. Should be resistant to high dimensionality.Feedback to theory.
		\item Why might sport and education be easy?
		\item Hybrid follows Multinomial since it's the default.
		\item Similarities between Tech / Science and Business / Education
		\item Low amount of data. Difficult to classify, even for a person.
		\item Why is random forest robust to data type?
		\item Naive bayes good for prediction, bad estimator
		\item All articles crawled at two points in time. Several articles may be about same thing, making it easier to predict with fewer articles in train set.
		\item Why do we only need like 50 articles to get a good classification? Maybe the thing with articles crawler at the same time.
