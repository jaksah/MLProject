It has been used to classify web documents by keywords, where it for five and seven topics performed better than ,e.g., Na√Øve Bayes and MLP \cite{keywords}. In the paper by Kopriska et al. they use Random Forest for classifying e-mails. Random Forest was able to out perform other methods, such as DT, SVM and NB\cite{email}.
