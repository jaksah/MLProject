	\nb\ models are widely used because of their simplicity and efficiency. A. McCallum and K. Nigam compares the two most common models, the multi-variate \bn\ and the \mn\ model, in the realm of document classification. They are explained in detail both theoretically and empirically and in general the \mn\ model outperforms the \bn\ model. \cite{McCallum98acomparison}
