\svm\ classifiers perform well on data that is linearly separable, since they find the optimal hyperplane that separates the data. They can however only separate data into two classes, but if combined they are able to perform multi-class classification. A simple approach is to use $k$ SVMs to solve a $k$-class classification problem. The SVMs may also be combined in a more sophisticated fashion, so that less than $k$ SVMs can be used. \cite{Mayoras99SVM}
