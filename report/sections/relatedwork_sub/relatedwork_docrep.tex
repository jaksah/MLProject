Tampakas et al. discusses different kind of data preparation and preprocessing, such as stemming and stopword deletion, which can be used to reduce the feature set and improve performance of the classifier. They also discuss various ways of representing the data. We've decided to follow the outline of the text classification process they present and investigate the effect of different kind of data representation. \cite{Ikonomakis05TextClassification}
