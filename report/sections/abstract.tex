\noindent Four classifiers, namely \bn\ \nb, \mn\ \nb, \rf, and \svm, were investigated in the field of text classification. The task was to classify the topics of news articles. The main focus of this report was to analyze, and compare between classifiers, the performance impact of varying vocabulary size due to feature selection for different data types as well as difficulties of distinguishing the eight different topics. All classifiers were anticipated to perform well in this task, but \mn\ \nb\ proved to be the best classifier with a maximum hit ratio of 76\% with a vocabulary size of 1022 words.
