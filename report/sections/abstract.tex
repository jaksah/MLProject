Four classifiers, namely Bernoulli Na•ve Bayes, Multinomial Na•ve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, were investigated in the field of text classification. The task was to classify the topics of news articles. The performance of the classifiers was investigated by comparing their hit rate, how similar the classifiers classify, and how they are affected by feature selection. All classifiers were anticipated to perform well in this task, but Multinomial Na•ve Bayes proved to be the best classifier, followed by Support Vector Machine.
