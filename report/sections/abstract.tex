Four classifiers, namely Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, were investigated in the field of text classification. The task was to classify the topics of news articles. The performance of the classifiers was investigated by comparing their hit ratio, how similar the classifiers classify, and how they are affected by feature selection. All classifiers were anticipated to perform well in this task, but Multinomial Naïve Bayes proved to be the best classifier, followed by Support Vector Machine.
