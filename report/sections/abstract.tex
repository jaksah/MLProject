\noindent Four classifiers, namely Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, were investigated in the field of text classification. The task was to classify the topics of news articles. Main focus of this report was to analyze, and compare between models, the performance impact of varying vocabulary size for different data types as well as difficulties of distinguishing the eight different topics. All classifiers were anticipated to perform well in this task, but Multinomial Naïve Bayes proved to be the best classifier, followed by Support Vector Machine.

% The performance of the classifiers was investigated by comparing their hit ratio, how similar the classifiers classify, and how they are affected by feature selection.
