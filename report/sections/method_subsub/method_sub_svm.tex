The settings for the Support Vector Machine classifier in the Scikit-learn package throughout the tests, if nothing else is stated, has been
\begin{description}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item[Penalty parameter C:] \ 1.0
	\item[Kernel:] \ Linear
	\item[Probability estimates:] \ False
	\item[Shrinking heuristic:] \ True
	\item[Tolerance for stopping:] \ 1e-3
	\item[Class weight:] \ Auto (automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies)
	\item[Hard limit on iterations within solver:] \ No limit
	\item[Random state for seed to random generator:] None
\end{description}
