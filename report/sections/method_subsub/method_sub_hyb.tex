For the \hy\ classifier, we let each of the four classifiers classify the sample, and then let them \emph{vote} for which class the sample should belong to. The \hy\ classifier chooses the majority to predict the class. We chose to have the prediction of the \mn\ \nb\ as default in the case of a tie.
