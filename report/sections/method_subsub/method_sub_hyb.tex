For the hybrid, we let each of the four classifiers classify the sample, and then let them \emph{vote} for which class the sample should belong to. The hybrid classifier chooses the majority to predict the class. We chose to have the prediction of the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes as default in the case of a tie.
