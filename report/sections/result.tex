The result of the analysis can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:hitratio} - \ref{fig:hitratio-data} and Table \ref{tab:similarity}. Figure \ref{fig:hitratio} shows, for the different models and data types, the overall hit ratio of correct classification as a function of vocabulary size after $\chi^2$ pruning. By comparing the figures it can be noted that the maximum accuracy of 76\% is attained with binary inputs by \mn\ at a vocabulary size of 1022 words. Another observation is that \bn\ is sensitive to vocabulary size compared to other models and \svm\  seems in contrast to \bn\ more robust to changes in vocabulary size. More results derived from these figures are that \rf\ is independent of the feature format and \hy\ follows the behavior of \mn.

The confusion matrices in Figure \ref{fig:confmat} describes the accuracy for specific topics. The rightmost column describes for a certain topic how many articles it contains and the accuracy of the topic. The bottom row describes for a certain predicted class, how many times that was the target class, and the accuracy when predicted. Analyzing the matrices one can observe that Sport and Education is fairly easy to classify in contrast to Technology and Education which is often misclassified as Science \& Environment and Business respectively. Notable is that \rf\ has a tendency of predicting Sports.
\\\\
Figure \ref{fig:hitratio-data} shows, for each model, how the hit rate depends on number of articles used as training set. The 500 highest scoring features is used to train the classifiers in order to keep the dimension of the feature space constant.

In Table \ref{tab:similarity} a comparison of the similarity of prediction when mispredicting is shown. The values resembles, given that both classifiers predicted wrong class, how many times they predicted the same class.
