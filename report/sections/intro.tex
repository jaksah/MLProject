There are many different types of classifiers and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. In text classification, the samples typically have feature vectors of high dimensionality. This project investigates four classifiers that hypothetically work well for feature vectors of high dimensions, namely \bn\ \nb, \mn\ \nb, \rf, and \svm.
