There are many different types of classifiers and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. In text classification, the samples typically have feature vectors of high dimensionality. This project investigates the performance of four classifiers that are expected to work well for feature vectors of high dimensions, namely \bn\ \nb, \mn\ \nb, \rf, and \svm. The investigation is carried out by giving the classifiers the task of classifying news articles from eight different topics and then comparing the results.
