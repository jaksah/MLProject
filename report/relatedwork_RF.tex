\subsection{Random Forest Classifier}
Random Forest is a decision tree based classification model. It has been used to classify web documents by keywords, where it for five and seven topics performed better than e.g. Naive Bayes and MLP \cite{keywords}. In I. Kopriska, J. Poon, J. Clark, J. Chan's paper, they use Random Forest for classifying e-mails. Random Forest was able to out perform other methods, such as DT, SVM and NB\cite{email}.
