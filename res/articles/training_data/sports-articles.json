McIlroy's unlucky sprinkler shot at 13     Watson has only ever won one of eight tournaments he has led at the halfway stage, but if McIlroy is to win, he will need to close the biggest deficit in Masters history - an eight stroke come back by Jack Burke in 1956 is the current best.\n     In pursuit of American Watson, Britain's best-placed players going into the weekend are Welshman \n     \n     and Scotland's \n     \n     who both sit on one under par.\n     Gallacher, a Masters debutant, birdied the par-five 15th as he ended the day on the same mark as he started. \n     The 39-year-old hit 12 of 14 fairways from the tee, but admitted he was \"glad to still be in the red numbers\" after a round which included four bogeys.\n     \"You've got to keep your temperament,\" said Gallacher. \"Your acceptance levels here have got to be through the roof, you've just got to hit it, accept it and get on with it. \n     The four par five holes on Augusta National played as the easiest on the golf course on day two. In all, 143 of the 290 birdies on the second day came on these holes, with leader Bubba Watson picking up shots on the back nine's two par fives\n     \"It's a very strategic course. I think everyone at home knows how to play it but it's just a case of trying to do it.\"\n     Donaldson described his standing at six shots behind Watson as \"a good position\", but acknowledged he has \"to try to hit more fairways\" over the weekend after finding just 14 of 28 so far. \n     On day two of the tournament, Augusta National's four par five holes played the easiest statistically, with 143 of the day's 290 birdies and seven eagles arriving on the quartet.\n Welshman Jamie Donaldson missed the cut in his debut Masters appearance in 2013\r\n        \n     was unable to capitalise on their generosity for the second day running and finished one under par for the day and level for the tournament.\n     \"I didn't play the par fives well enough again,\" said 40-year-old Westwood who is still searching for a first major title. \"Over two days, I've made eight fives and that's where you make your scores. You need birdies over the weekend on them. \n     \"There's good scores if you play well and disasters if you start hitting a few wild shots. I'm comfortable out there and can see a way around it.\"\n     US Open champion \n     \n     and fellow Englishman \n     \n     both carded scores of 70 on day two to move to two over for the tournament.\n     The 11th hole, named White Dogwood, played the hardest on the course for the second day. A par four, it is averaging more than 4.5 shots and claimed 37 bogeys and 10 double bogeys on Friday. \n     \"That was one of the best rounds I have had at Augusta in terms of ball striking, but I finish disappointed because I left shots on the course,\" said Poulter.\n     \"I three-putted at 10 and at 14. I know I am playing well, my scores are not reflecting that but they are coming and I need to stay patient.\"\n     Elsewhere, Northern Ireland's \n     \n    conceded \"Augusta is still a work in progress\" for him after missing the cut along with England's \n     \n ",

He was on course to tie the Masters record of seven consecutive birdies, set by Steve Pate (1999) and Tiger Woods (2005), but the streak came to an end with a par at the 17th.\n     Bubba Watson's five consecutive birdies fired him into the outright lead, but the record for back-to-back birdies at Augusta is shared by Steve Pate (1999) and Tiger Woods (2005) with seven apiece\n     Watson finished with a bogey after missing the 18th green with his approach but put himself in pole position for a second major title.\n     \"It's not science here, it's try to hit the greens,\" said Watson, who admits the burden of being defending champion last year took its toll as he finished tied 50th.\n     Scott dropped to level par with bogeys at the first, fourth and fifth but edged back to one under with a birdie on the short 12th. He picked up further shots at the par-five 13th and 15th and made a decent par save on the last after driving into the trees to clinch a share of third.\n     \"It's good to be within shouting distance but it's going to take a big day tomorrow,\" said Scott.\n     McIlroy went out in 37, including a double bogey via the trees on the short fourth, and made a second double on the 10th after hitting his second through the green and knocking a scruffy chip back barely onto the green. \n Bubba Watson has only won one tournament since claiming the Masters in 2012\r\n       More bogeys followed on 11 and 13, where his approach took an unfortunate bounce off a sprinkler head into the azaleas behind the green and he was forced to hack out sideways. \n     He knocked in a five-footer on 18 to make the cut but will have to beat the biggest comeback after 36 holes if he is to clinch a third major title this weekend - Jack Burke came from a record eight shots behind at halfway to win in 1956.\n     \"It was very frustrating,\" said McIlroy, who did not realise he needed a par on 18 to make the cut. \"I just couldn't get anything to go my way.

They are given guidance as to what they should do for disabled supporters and how many spaces they should provide but this isn't being followed.\n     \"The problem is that the clubs aren't being made to follow it, and neither the FA nor the Premier League has any rules telling them what the minimum standard should be. As a result, the experience of a disabled fan varies greatly from ground to ground.\n     \"Football showed in the wake of Hillsborough and the move to all-seater stadiums that it is capable of drastic action.  However, until clubs are forced to follow these guidelines, wide-scale change in this case appears unlikely.\"\n     Penning said a complete overhaul of grounds was required, \"starting at the very top\".\n     He added: \"The situation is currently woefully inadequate and it is not only wheelchair access that falls short, but access for people with all kinds of impairments.\"\n     Guidelines on how football clubs in the UK should cater for disabled spectators have been in place since 2004. \n     The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     sets out minimum standards that all new grounds have to meet in the provision, location, and quality of facilities for disabled fans. The number of wheelchair spaces a stadium should provide is based on its capacity. \n     Since the implementation of the Equality Act in 2010, and legislation dating back to 1995, it has been illegal for service providers, including football clubs, to treat disabled people less favourably than other customers.\n     Clubs can be ordered to make reasonable adjustments, which can include providing induction loops for those with hearing impairments, audio-description facilities for those with sight impairments and free tickets for carers who accompany disabled fans at games.\n     The Premier League insist they are following the existing regulations, and said: \"The Accessible Stadia Guide sets out agreed standards to be achieved when new grounds are designed or existing grounds rebuilt, however all clubs use those standards to assess existing provisions and guide them on how to make improvements.\n     \"Particular attention is given to achieving stadium management solutions that make the best of the constraints and opportunities inherent in each stadium. This includes working with the fans to arrive at solutions that work for them, and providing special training for stewards and staff to ensure that appropriate assistance is given.\" \n     Joyce Cook, chair of \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     formerly known as the National Association of Disabled Supporters, added: \"The experience of disabled football fans varies across the country. That's not acceptable and it's time all football clubs took their legal obligations seriously.\"\n ",

Even when I've run a personal best I've still gone through rough spots.\n     \"It's important not to panic and to keep focused. Use little techniques to make yourself think about the moment, whether it's singing to yourself, counting landmarks or counting in your head - anything. \n     \"I used to count to 100 three times in my head and I knew that was roughly a mile.\n     \"That helped me break down the mile into smaller chunks so instead of thinking 'I've got 12 miles left', you're just counting 'one, two, three...' and that's all you're thinking about. You will disappear into your own little world.\n     \"There will be times when you start questioning yourself and it's during those times you must think back to the preparation you've done. Nine times out of 10 the race is much easier than your longest training run. You're rested, you're fresher and you have the support of the crowd, use their energy.\n     \"Have an idea of what time you want to do but if you're feeling better than expected, throw that out of the window, and, equally, if you're feeling rough, stop looking at the clock and concentrate on completing the race.\"\n      \n     \"Last year I was asked what kept me going and I replied by saying \n    \r\n  \r\n\n    ' I was joking, of course. \n     \"I run in an orange bib and on the back it says 'oldest marathon runner' so when I'm walking along I get a tap on the shoulder from people asking me how old I am. By the time I've done four or five miles I've got bruises from all the tapping!\n     \"But it's a case of taking one mile at a time. My running days are over. It's hard for me these days, I am almost down to walking pace, but what keeps me going is\n    \r\n  \r\n\n     I'm running for and the thought of my friends and family at the finishing line.\"\n      \n     \"I used to sing Eurythmics's \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     because the beat of that is really good for maintaining a good average speed. \n     \"Wheelchair racing is a bit more like cycling. It's more like a stage race in the Tour de France, completely different to running the London Marathon. \n     \"In wheelchair races you're more likely to have a pack race and I would always try to stay in the pack, mainly because I was a stronger sprinter and I used to find racing on my own really hard. If I was on my own that's when the Eurythmics song would come in. \n     \"If you're in a pack there's loads of stuff to think about, like breakaways, and there's a lot of protection being in the pack, because of slipstreaming and protection from the wind, so there's no time to sing or count.\"\n      \n     \"Being positive is important to cope with the rigours of a marathon. However, being overly positive can often result in an unrealistic belief that the marathon will be entirely positive. Being confident in your ability is crucial but you do not want to be arrogant.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Need the toilet? Prof Whyte's essential marathon tips     \"Most people become emotional during a marathon. When you are pushing your body and mind to their limits for such a long period of time it is inevitable, and acceptable, that emotions play a part. \n     \"Hitting the wall is the culmination of a number of factors but primarily it happens when you are very low on energy, usually carbohydrates. As well as physical symptoms of fatigue and a reduction in pace you will also have psychological changes related to mood, such as increased anger and depression. \n     \"That is entirely avoidable by ensuring you run your race at your pace, and your nutrition is well planned and executed so take on board fluid and fuel - little, often, and early.\n     \"When the going gets tough just think about why you are doing it. What is your motivation? Is it to raise money or awareness for a loved one? Is it a personal goal of achievement?\n     \"Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Great journeys are made with small steps.\"\n      \n     \"It's tough going from a team event like rowing, where everybody knows when you're not giving 100%, to an individual event where it's only you who knows if you're not giving 100%.\n     \"You know the pain will hit you at some point and it's down to you how much you're prepared to give. \n     \"I usually take a pair of headphones with me, but not to listen to music, it's just so that nobody talks to me. They think I'm listening to music and it gives me the excuse not to be rude and to blank everything out. \n     \"Also, when you look around there are people who clearly look in pain. There's always someone else who is in more pain so that can be a reassurance during the tough moments.\"\n      \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \n     \"Different people want different things out of the marathon but you don't have to run around with your eyes popping out like organ stops. I don't use a watch and never have.\n     \"For someone who just wants to complete the race, don't be afraid to walk. It's better to walk a little bit rather than push yourself. It's a bit silly to get annoyed for being 30 seconds behind your target. \n     \"The London Marathon is absolutely fabulous, it's like a big street party, and you don't have to rush around because there are people who will talk to you. On one occasion I kissed as many policemen en route as I could!\"\n      \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \"One of the most important things to do is to take on board fluid and not to think you can't stop for 10 seconds because most people aren't running to get a super time. \n     \"If that means you stop running for 30 seconds then so be it. Try energy drinks before the race and, if you don't like them, just regard them as medicine. \n     \"And if you are trapped among people, don't weave through them, conserve your energy and just relax. The most important night sleep is the Friday to Saturday before the race. If you are lying in bed, tossing and turning on the Saturday night don't panic because it won't affect you too much.\n     \"The challenge for me is to say I have run all the London Marathons in under three hours. It won't be easy because I have a niggling hamstring injury, but I will definitely finish. Two years ago I ran across America and if I can do that then I can do the London Marathon. They will have to scrape me off the road!\"\n     \"I use crochet, which forms a series of interlocking chains, as a way of explaining how dementia breaks the link between brain cells. In a healthy brain, thoughts flow freely between each connected section, while dementia breaks the links between cells until the brain is no longer able to function.

I got to the halfway mark and felt fantastic, but at mile 14 I had a massive asthma attack and felt like death. \n     \"The last mile took me 30 minutes to complete and I ended up finishing in five hours and 47 seconds. I was beside myself with grief and nothing was going to convince me it wasn't the end of the world. \n     \"I've still got the fridge magnet with my time on it from 2012 and it motivates me.

        "article": "    As Liverpool prepares to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough, manager Brendan Rodgers is using \"the 96 in the sky\" as inspiration to deliver the honour Anfield treasures most.\n     Liverpool's last league title came in 1990, a year after Hillsborough - and those who died at the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest will be remembered at an emotional Anfield when the club meet Manchester City on Sunday.\n     The game, a possible title decider, will have \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     with a 13:37 BST kick-off, seven minutes later than usual to recall the period when Liverpool's game with Forest was stopped because of events unfolding on the Leppings Lane terrace at the home of Sheffield Wednesday.\n \r\n\t\t One lad looked me in the eye and said: 'Al, there are people dying in there' \r\n\t     \r\n  \r\n\n     as the Hillsborough families hope for closure after 25 years and Liverpool will be hoping to offer further footballing comfort by finally returning to the top of the domestic game.\n     Former Reds captain Alan Hansen, who was part of Liverpool's side that day, tells BBC Sport: \"It would be a tremendous thing for Liverpool to win the title on the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough and 24 years after they last won it, but every family will be different.\n     \"Justice and closure is the most important thing for the families and I feel 100% compassion for them. Liverpool winning the league would come a long way second or third in that process, although of course as fans they would love to see the club enjoy such success.\n     \"It would be great for Liverpool, Liverpool supporters and the Hillsborough families for Liverpool to win the title but that would not be the most important thing for them.\"\n     Hansen was playing his first game of the season at Hillsborough because of injury, and the memories of the day and the aftermath are still raw and recalled with emotion.\n     \"Whenever Hillsborough is brought up at any time, whether people talk about it, it is on the news or about how the fight of the families goes on, right away you start reflecting,\" says Hansen.\n A Liverpool fan pays his respects to the 96 supporters who died at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989\r\n       \"The day itself will never leave you. Then there was the aftermath as well, going to the hospital in Sheffield on the Monday. The first person that came to us was a mother with a 14-year-old son. The life support machine was going to be cut off and she wanted us to see the boy before they cut it off.\n     \"It was a million times worse and more for the mother but nobody prepares you for that. You're talking to a boy - and my son Adam was eight at the time and my daughter Lucy was five - that when you leave they are going to cut off the life support machine. I can hardly describe it.\n     \"The days after Hillsborough provided the whole range of emotions, when you are just crying your eyes out. You'd go up to Anfield talking to the bereaved and no-one knew what had happened. I'll never forget it until the day I die.\n     \"We were like counsellors. We didn't have any training and half the time families would talk to us and we were the ones who were crying.\"\n     Liverpool eventually returned to action and, despite losing out on the league title after Michael Thomas's last-minute goal for Arsenal, went on to win the FA Cup with victory over Everton.\n     However, Hansen adds: \"If I'd lost somebody, would I have wanted Liverpool to keep going in the FA Cup? The answer was probably not, but there were a lot of families that wanted it. When you go on the pitch you are thinking about nothing other than the game - it is totally bizarre in many ways. \n     \"It was sadness beyond belief and there were times when we were crying our eyes out and yet as soon as we got back on the pitch we were still going for the title and were 100% immersed in the football. There was almost a guilt thing at times. You are filled with sadness, then you are going out and playing.\"\n     Hansen's part in that semi-final was a reluctant one after fighting to regain full fitness following a serious knee injury.\n     He admits: \"I didn't want to play. I injured my knee in Spain in pre-season, had only played one reserve game on the Tuesday night and had only been back in training three weeks. \n     \"There was a virus which Barry Venison got and somebody else got and [manager] Kenny [Dalglish] told me I had to play. I told him I couldn't. I was 33 at the time and to go in straightaway might have been OK for someone who was 23 - but I was in.\n     \"I was totally immersed in the game and blind to anything. Two guys came on the pitch and I was the first there. I thought it was an invasion and told them they'd better get off or we'd be in trouble. I was maybe a bit off with them, then one lad looked me in the eye and said, 'Al, there are people dying in there.'\n     \"Even then I was thinking 'surely not' but then we came off and the whole reality hit us.\"\n     There was a footballing context for Liverpool as Dalglish, who emerged as the symbol of the club during the months following Hillsborough, succumbed to the strain and resigned in February 1991 with the club reigning champions.\n     Although Liverpool have not won a title since then, Hansen does not regard Dalglish's departure as the catalyst for those barren years.\n     He says: \"Without a shadow of a doubt it took its toll on Kenny. He did so much - setting up things for the families, with his wife Marina taking calls from relatives.\n     \"But it was an ageing team and the hardest thing for any manager to do is to break a team up, as Manchester United have found. I wouldn't say Hillsborough or Kenny going was the catalyst for any decline. \n Liverpool's last league title was in 1990 - the season after the Hillsborough disaster\r\n       \"The hardest part of any successful unit is to break it up and start again. Liverpool had done it about five times and sooner or later there is the chance you will not get it quite right.\"\n     Hansen believes Liverpool have a great opportunity to put that right this season, saying: \"All the way through the golden era the league title was the most important and always will be. Out of all the four tournaments, when they used to be big, the league was always the one we wanted.\n     \"Liverpool haven't won it for 24 years. It could be the start of a new era - and it is that important because next season Manchester United won't be as bad again and Manchester City and Chelsea will spend big.\n     \"Will Luis Suarez ever have another season like he has just had? If Liverpool win the league the supporters will regard it as being back where they belong.\n The Premier League table as it stands\r\n       \"Anfield will be very emotional on Sunday. The atmosphere will be phenomenal and Manchester City are a very good side but every time Liverpool have been asked the question they've answered.\"\n     And if manager Rodgers does emulate Dalglish, the victims of Hillsborough and their families will be in his thoughts.\n     \"We can't say too much about Hillsborough because the inquests are under way,\" says Rodgers. \"But as a manager coming into the football club I know there are 96 people in the sky who will always be supporting this football team.\n     \"If we are to achieve anything this year, they will always be in our thoughts - the 96 in the sky and the families that go with them.\"\n ",

        "article": "    For a brief moment in Munich, Manchester United dared to dream. \n     As it was, that hope was gone in 60 seconds of Patrice Evra's goal \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     They are seventh in the Premier League, seven points off the Champions League places. Realistically they will not make the top four so they must now wait until September 2015, at the earliest, before they are back in a competition that has become part of the furniture at Old Trafford. \n \r\n\t\t Manchester United are by far the most profitable football club in the world \r\n\t     It has been 19 years since United were last on the outside looking in. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers took the one English place. \n     Manchester United is a club that knows all about comebacks and about overcoming adversity, but there is much for David Moyes and his board to ponder as they prepare for a summer of rebuilding.\n     There is a belief within United's corridors of power that life without the Champions League will be a one-off. Liverpool thought the same when they dropped out in 2009-10, after five consecutive seasons. Four years on, they are only just on the brink of a return having finished seventh last season. \n     United finished 38 points ahead of Liverpool last season, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     - a swing of 55 points in 11 months. United will hope it is not a sign of things to come.\n     The plan of United's executive vice-chairman Edward Woodward and owners the Glazer family remains for Moyes to oversee an overhaul of the playing squad this summer. His transfer budget will be significant. \n     Key targets include Borussia Dortmund forward Marco Reus, and midfielders Toni Kroos from Bayern and Atletico Madrid's Koke. But will those players be prepared to sacrifice Champions League football to join United? \n     Many say not. \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Each of their 'superstar' targets have been sounded out and United have been given encouragement. The problem may come if clubs with Champions League qualification join the bidding and are willing to match the financial packages on offer at Old Trafford. \n Can United persuade the likes of Bayern's Kroos to live without Champions League football next season?\r\n       The Southampton pair of Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana are targets for Moyes. Both will be offered the chance to join the start of a new era at United. That is how United are selling themselves. But that is only half the battle. \n     When Manchester City were trying to break into the top four, they were forced to outbid their rivals and offer more in wages than the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and United themselves. City blew Chelsea out of the water to sign Robinho, offering the Brazilian \u00a3160,000 a week. \n     They paid \u00a390,000 per week to Wayne Bridge and, a few weeks after finishing fifth in the Premier League, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     to leave Barcelona. But then City were viewed as a club that was going places. Can United say the same?\n     Football agent Barry Silkman said: \"Manchester United is an incredible club, but things do change in football and I believe they will struggle to attract the very highest calibre of player. The only way to do it, is to pay big money. \n     \"It worked for Manchester City to a degree but they have paid massive salaries, and transfer fees that have been way over the top. They had no option, but United have to think of Financial Fair Play. They'll do well to finish in the top four next season.\"\n     There is also, of course, the question of keeping their very best players. \n     United are a financial superpower in football terms. They have pushed boundaries in the commercial world and boast no fewer than 35 individual sponsors, including an official noodle partner for Asia, Oceania and the Middle East, as well as 11 telecommunications partners around the world. \n Financially United are able to cope with a one-season absence from the Champions League, say experts\r\n       \"Manchester United are unique,\" said Christian Purslow, the former Liverpool managing director. \"They are by far the most profitable football club in the world. Their total profits this year, a difficult year, are still expected to be some \u00a3130m. Nobody is in a better position financially to withstand being out of the Champions League for a season. \n     \"I don't think sponsors would want to see United out of the Champions League for a long time. I don't think those sponsors will want to live with it for beyond a year and I expect United have not the slightest intention of allowing that to happen. Which is why I expect them to be incredibly active in this summer's transfer market.\"\n     United have been in talks with Nike for the past 12 months about renewing their record \u00a324m-a-year kit deal. United have not been prepared to countenance allowing Nike to get a cut-price deal, and nor do Nike expect to negotiate one.\n     In recent weeks, officials from Nike have been in meetings with United and have passed officials from Adidas on their way in as the Old Trafford club search out the best deal. The message is clear, that United remain in demand. \n     The timing of their world record \u00a353m per season \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     could not have been better when it was agreed 12 months ago. It will be unaffected by the club's absence from the Champions League when it begins next season. \n     Nor will United's eight-year contract with Aon, which is worth at least \u00a3180m to sponsor the club's training ground and training kit. The numbers are astonishing. \n     The impact on sponsors may take time to pinch, but a more immediate concern will be the loss of Champions League prize money, TV revenue and gate receipts. \n     Last season, United made \u00a331.3m from Champions League broadcasting money. Prize money came on top of that. Uefa pays around \u00a3800,000 for each Champions League win, a draw earns you \u00a3415,000. Prize money can be substantial - Chelsea took home \u00a348m from Uefa when they won in 2012. \n     Dan Jones, a partner in Deloitte's sports business group, said: \"There is certainly no need for United to panic. They are still signing up sponsors and I'd suggest that most of their major deals are not dependent on them being in the Champions League. \n     \"That means the only real loss they will feel comes from Champions League TV revenue, prize money and perhaps the lost gate receipts from home matches they might have staged. Some of that may be mitigated by Europa League qualification and, possibly, built-in savings in player contracts. All that adds up to around \u00a340-50m - only about 10% of their expected total revenue.\" \n     Senior figures at United would like to qualify for the Europa League, despite the logistical difficulties. Were United to win the Europa League in 2014-15, they would earn \u00a310m from Uefa.\n     That is a question no-one can answer with certainty. United officials will tell you one season and one season only. Those at Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and even Everton may also go into the new season with that in mind. \n     And with a new bumper Champions League deal to come in within the next 12 months, the prize has never been greater. \"For many years, it was a formality that the big four [United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool] would be in the Champions League,\" Purslow added.\n     \"That made running these clubs, in terms of their expected income and their wage spending, relatively simple. But the emergence of Manchester City changed the Premier League forever. \n Sir Alex Ferguson took United into the Champions League 19 years in a row and won it twice \r\n       \"Five massive clubs going for four Champions League places doesn't go. That is causing intense competition both on the field and off the field in the commercial marketplace, and that will only intensify. \n     \"Missing out on the Champions League this year represents \u00a330m in missed TV revenue for United - in 12 months' time, when the new Champions League TV deal kicks in, the cost of missing out will double. None of those five want to be on the wrong side of that.\"\n     Sir Alex Ferguson built the United empire as the game of football became a global business. That financial might will shelter Moyes for one season without Champions League football. United officials may not look so kindly on a second season without that prize.\n ",

        "article": "    In his regular BBC Sport tactics column, Robbie Savage looks at \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Both teams are attack-minded and high-scoring with exciting forward players, and both have weaknesses in defence, despite City's recent improvement at the back.\n     So the battle for control of the game in midfield will be vital at Anfield, particularly how each team tries to protect their back four.\n Signing of the season? Fernandinho joined City from Shakhtar Donetsk for \u00a330m in the summer of 2013\r\n       For Manchester City, Fernandinho is seen as their main defensive midfielder, but there is much more to his game than that.\n     His energy will be vital for Manuel Pellegrini's men, not just when it comes down to winning the ball back from Liverpool, but also in turning defence into attack.\n     I sometimes hear people describe Fernandinho as being an anchor man in the mould of former Chelsea star Claude Makelele, because they think Yaya Toure is the City midfielder who gets forward.\n     But in fact Fernandinho and Toure work in tandem as a pair of box-to-box players. They have got a great partnership because they share defensive and attacking responsibilities in City's usual 4-2-3-1 formation.\n     It is Toure who grabs the headlines because of his rampaging runs but Fernandinho is an unsung hero for City because of the energy he brings to their team, his mobility, and the amount of work he puts in.\n     Defensively, Fernandinho covers a lot of ground when City do not have possession and puts the most pressure on the ball. If you add up interceptions and tackles, he has won it back more than any other City player this season.\n Stats: Opta 1. Fernandinho (58) 1. Yaya Toure (177) 2. Martin Demichelis (47) 2. Fernandinho (155) 3. Pablo Zabaleta (45) 3. Vincent Kompany (111)     In contrast to Steven Gerrard, who does play the holding role for Liverpool, Fernandinho does not just turn over possession by sitting in front of his defence. Instead, he goes hunting for the ball.\n     In the past, Gerrard would have covered the same amount of ground as the 28-year-old Brazilian - who chases teams down, often high up the pitch - but these days he stays much deeper, apart from at set-pieces.\n     Like City, Liverpool look to get lots of players forward quickly when they win the ball but, on Sunday, Gerrard will not be one of them. He only enters the final third for set-pieces, from which he has provided seven of his nine assists and his three goals that have not come from the penalty spot. \n     It is different for Toure and Fernandinho. When you play with two box-to-box men in the middle like City do, they have to be disciplined. When one goes forward, the other has to stay - even if they probably both want to go.\n     Getting that balance right at Anfield will be vital for City and not just because of the different threats Liverpool pose.\n     Fernandinho and Toure will have to help their defence deal with the Reds' fast forwards when they break, watch for their overlapping full-backs and also put pressure on Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho, who will be looking to ping longer balls over and through City's back-line.\n Stats: Opta Games & Minutes 26 & 2,220 29 & 2,450 Goals/Shots 4/22 13/40 (10 pens) Assists 3 9 Chances created 31 57 Passes (% completed) 1,394 (88%) 1,832 (86%) Tackles (% won) 78 (78%) 79 (71%)     The City pairing have attacking responsibilities, too. Toure's main threat is through his trademark runs forward and shots from distance. Fernandinho is less spectacular but he is fast, good on the ball, able to pick out a pass and can burst into the box to get on the end of moves as well.\n     The most crucial thing about Fernandinho, though, is that the high-tempo he helps to set allows City to launch fast attacks of their own.\n     \r\n  \r\n\n     but the same could be said about Fernandinho for City.\n Stats: Opta Games 26 5 29 4 Wins 21 1 21 2 Defeats 3 2 3 2 Goals for 80 4 80 10 Av. goals for 3.08 0.8 2.75 2.5 Win % 81% 20% 72% 50% Points per game 2.5 1 2.3 1.5     When City win the ball and go forward, they move it about quickly, sometimes taking only one touch to lay it into the path of a team-mate and breaking into the box at devastating speed.\n     Fernandinho does not try to play searching long passes forward like Gerrard does. Instead, his job when he gets the ball back is to quickly push forward himself or immediately give it to a player ahead of him - David Silva or Samir Nasri, or one of City's overlapping full-backs.\n     That is what they will try to do against Liverpool, and City do not always attack at the same breathtaking speed when Fernandinho is not there - \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Martin Demichelis was in midfield and he took too many touches, which slowed City down.\n     City have failed to score in four of the five league games that Fernandinho has missed this season. They are the only times they have not found the net this season.\n     One of the factors behind Liverpool's success this season has been \n    \r\n  \r\n\n      and how he mixes up his midfield and attack depending on the opposition.\n     We got an idea of what to expect at Anfield \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     They went 1-0 up but lost 2-1 despite having enough chances to win the game, with their worst miss coming when Raheem Sterling skied his shot when he was clean through.\n     Liverpool played a 4-3-3 formation that day. But they did not have Daniel Sturridge or Gerrard, who were both injured. City, who were without Sergio Aguero, lined up in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Alvaro Negredo as their lone striker.\n     Luis Suarez played as Liverpool's central striker, with Coutinho on the left and Sterling on the right. Lucas Leiva played in the holding midfield role, staying very deep just like Gerrard does.\n     This time, I think Rodgers will go 4-3-3 again, but with Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling across the front three, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     That means Coutinho will be in the team but playing much deeper than he did on Boxing Day.\n     Again, just as in that Spurs game, where Sterling and Glen Johnson went at Tottenham left-back Danny Rose, I think Liverpool will target the left side of City's defence.\n     Whether it is Gael Clichy or Aleksandar Kolarov at left-back, and Martin Demichelis or Joleon Lescott as City's left-sided centre-back, that side is far weaker than Kompany and Pablo Zabaleta on the right.\n     Because of the pace of the Liverpool attack, I think City should go with their faster defenders to deal with it - Clichy and Lescott rather than Kolarov and Demichelis.\n     It is a big call for Pellegrini, but he has stuck with Demichelis until now, and probably will again. Whoever he goes for alongside Kompany, it is a gamble.\n     City are used to starting games on the front foot but their defence will have to be ready for a fast start by Liverpool on Sunday. \n     Time and time again this season, particularly at Anfield, Liverpool have over-run lots of teams early on in games. \n     They have scored in the first half in 31 of their 33 league games so far, and have hit a total of 54 first-half goals, by far the most of any top-flight team.\n 1. Liverpool - 54 1. Chelsea - 9 2. Man City - 37 2. Man City - 10 3. Chelsea - 28 3. Everton - 12 Liverpool have played two more games than City 1. Liverpool - 31 1. = Chelsea/Everton - 24 2. Man City - 22 3. Arsenal - 22 3. Chelsea - 18 4. = Man City/C Palace/Hull - 21     City are also a high-scoring, attacking team. Both they and Liverpool have a chance of beating Chelsea's record from 2009-10 of 103 goals in a Premier League campaign.\n Liverpool have played two more games than City Liverpool 455 (1) 227 (1) 19.78% (2) 90 (1) Man City 420 (3) 195 (3) 20% (1) 84 (2)     Their strength is going forward, but City have improved defensively in recent months, and have conceded only four goals in their last nine Premier League games, compared to 25 in their previous 22 league matches. \n     There are plenty of reasons they will be confident of surviving any early onslaught at Anfield. Pellegrini's side have conceded the first goal only five times in their 31 Premier League games, and only four first-half goals in 16 league games away from home. Only Chelsea have conceded fewer first-half goals in total.\n     Part of that comes down to the way City impose themselves on games rather than their ability to hold out under pressure, but they can defend when they have to.\n Liverpool have played two more games than City Liverpool 424 (11th best) 130 (6th best) 40 (7th best) 10 (=10th best) Man City 307 (1st best) 106 (2nd best) 29 (2nd best) 13 (=2nd best)     They will have to be solid at Anfield. The strength of Liverpool's attack means this will be City's biggest defensive test in the league this season. Any lapses will be punished.\n     Even without any individual errors, the Reds front three is good enough to find a way through City's back four, so the protection offered by Fernandinho and Toure in front of them will be crucial. They cannot leave their defence exposed at any time.\n     I would expect an open game, where both teams have spells where they are on top and both teams create lots of chances. Just like at Etihad Stadium, who wins will come down to which team can take theirs.\n      \n ",

        "article": "    In Britain, Argentine Diego Simeone is best remembered as the man whose reaction to a petulant kick by David Beckham resulted in the England star famously being sent off during a World Cup game in 1998.\n     That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). \n Simeone was on the receiving end of Beckham's infamous kick in 1998\r\n       And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days.\n     If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\"\n     Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff.\n     Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real.\n     To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. \n     Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles.\n     The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes.\n     Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football.\n     For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. \n     In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer.\n     That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks.\n     That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. \n Atletico are unbeaten against Barcelona in five matches this season and meet on the final day of the La Liga campaign\r\n       Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack.\n     As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. \n     Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable.\n     More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head.\n     For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up.\n     That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster.\n Simeone credited the Atletico fans with inspiring his team to victory in the Champions League\r\n       Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort.\n     When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour.\n Head to head and not goal difference decides teams level on points. Atletico have better record than Real, and yet to play Barcelona twice 79 78 76     As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. \n     But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility.\n     Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\"\n     Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be. \n ",

        "article": "    Augusta. The Masters. Three words to make golf fans drool every April. \n     This hallowed corner of an unremarkable Georgia town is one of sport's most famous settings, the tournament one of the world's most unique events. Here are 18 reasons why we love the Masters.\n     Ah, Augusta. Just the name evokes an iconic image in green, punctuated by explosions of colour from banks of azaleas and framed by towering pines, with grass so velvety you could make a suit out of it. \n     Driving up the adjacent Washington Road strip, with its bars, burger joints, motels, parking lots and neon plantations, you would struggle to believe such treasure could lie over the fence. \"It's like being in the most perfect picture that has ever been painted,\" said England's Ian Poulter.\n     Think genteel country club rather than brash sports venue. The smart but humble 19th century plantation-style clubhouse at the end of Magnolia Lane sets the tone for this spring rite. The visual splendour, the traditions and history, the reverence of the spectators and Augusta's limited-numbers policy add to the occasion. \"It's a very interesting place and has a wonderful feel. I still love it after 40-odd years,\" says veteran BBC golf broadcaster Peter Alliss.\n     It's Augusta's way or the highway, but the rules - strictly enforced with Southern charm - add to the ambience. Broadcasters and the media are also expected to toe the line. Fans are to be known as \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and controversy is to be avoided. The no-running rule does at least provide the morning spectacle of speed-walkers scuttling off to all parts to place chairs. Phones are also a no-no, as is sleeping on the course. \"I always marvel at how they control all those people with a bit of string. Possibly some trepidation at putting a foot wrong,\" notes Alliss.\n     Stay on the right side of the law and the Masters will treat you well. Sandwiches, including the traditional Pimento Cheese, cost between $1.50 and $3 and domestic beer, in Masters-logoed plastic cups you can take home, is $3. Fancy foreign stuff is $4. Despite an image rooted in tradition, the Augusta National is always looking to refine and innovate, such as the state-of-the-art digital coverage. Southern splendour with a modern agenda.\n     As the only major at the same venue every year, each triumph and disaster adds another layer to the legend. The National was opened in 1933 on the site of an old plant nursery, and the first Masters - then called the \"Invitational\" - was staged the following year. Traditions abound, such as the Champions Dinner, ceremonial starters, the par-three contest or amateurs bunking down in the Crow's Nest above the clubhouse.  Landmarks also become old friends. The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     because of damage was news around the world.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Archive - Nick Faldo helps 1991 winner Ian Woosnam slip into his Green Jacket      The tropical-weight emerald blazer might not be to everyone's taste, but it is one of golf's most coveted accolades. The jacket was first introduced for members in 1937 and ordered from Brooks Uniform Company in New York. \n     Sam Snead was the first winner to receive a jacket and honorary membership in 1949. The reigning Masters champion can take it home for a year, then it must be kept at the club. The jacket comes with a two-page list of rules, according to last year's winner Adam Scott.\n     A Masters badge feels like Willy Wonka's golden ticket to most but the lucky few (well, roughly 30,000 a day on practice days, half that during the tournament) get one of the best views in sport. Augusta's seat-saving etiquette is unique. Plonk your green fold-up chair anywhere outside the ropes and return hours later to reclaim your spot. It will be empty and waiting. \n Patrons arrange chairs around Amen Corner during the second round of the 2013 Masters\r\n       The Tuesday evening shindig for past champions is one of sport's most exclusive clubs. The elite few dine off a menu dreamed up by last year's winner. \n     Tradition dictates they opt for dishes from their homeland, throwing up some mouthwatering delicacies over the years such as Sandy Lyle's \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and Charl Schwartzel's monkey gland sauce. \n     Arnie, Jack and co. can order off the clubhouse menu if they're not game for a bush tucker trial. Australia's Scott will serve \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     a surf 'n' turf BBQ and his mum's pavlova. \"I didn't feel I could serve kangaroo or crocodile to these guys.\" \n     Kids, wags and celebs don the caddie's traditional white boiler suit for the traditional Wednesday afternoon laugh-fest over the picturesque par-three course. \n Rory McIlroy had fiancee Caroline Wozniacki on his bag during last year's par-three event\r\n       The family fun, back-slapping and bonhomie act as a release valve before the main event. \n     But there is mischief at work on the banks of Ike's Pond - the Curse of the Par Three. In its 53-year existence, no par-three champion has ever won the Masters in the same year.\n      \n     White Dogwood, 505 yards, par 4.  \n      \n     Golden Bell, 155 yards, par 3.\n      \n     Azalea, 510 yards, par 5. \n     Golf's most iconic stretch of holes, visually stunning and technically demanding, Amen Corner can be a round-wrecker or a springboard for a back-nine charge. \n     The term \"Amen Corner\" was coined by sportswriter Herbert Warren Wind in 1958 for the area down at the lowest part of the course: the 11th, 12th and tee shot on 13. \n     The par-four 11th is the second most difficult hole on the course, after the 10th, followed by the short 12th across Rae's Creek where the wind swirls and makes club selection so difficult. Tom Weiskopf holds the record with a 13 there, in 1980. \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     says three-time champion Gary Player. \"Amen Corner - what an appropriate name.\"\n     If leaves and branches could talk, these boughs would have thousands of stories to tell. The old oak - or actually two oaks, one smaller one next to the main tree - on the course side of the clubhouse is the hub of Masters week. \n     All golf's movers, shakers and hangers-on will be found lurking in its shade, interviewing players, doing business deals, gossiping, being seen. \n     Everyone's guilty of \"fomo\" (fear of missing out) as eyes dart and heads swivel, trying to spot someone more important to talk to. 'Meet you under the tree' is a traditional Masters refrain for those with the right badge.\n Caddies with Mike Weir, Garrick Porteous and Jason Day on Hogan's Bridge on the 12th hole in practice \r\n       That ice-white boiler suit is quintessential Augusta. Before 1983, staff caddies were assigned to Masters players. All were black, and many went by nicknames such as Fireball, Ironman and Cemetery. After 1983, players were allowed to bring their own caddies but they still had to wear the traditional white jump suit. \n     Two-time champion Ben Crenshaw's long-time Masters caddie Carl Jackson is one of the remaining old school Augusta bagmen, who began working at the course aged 14 in 1961. He will work a record 53rd Masters this year. \"That suit is pretty thick so you can get really hot. At least you can pack light - a couple of pairs of shorts and some T-shirts to wear under it,\" said Martin Kaymer's caddie Craig Connelly.\n     An icon in white, the modest manor belies is status as the home of the Green Jackets. Built in 1854 by the owner of the then indigo plantation, it stands sentinel at the highest point of the course. \n     The front door, at the end of Magnolia Lane, opens onto a short hallway with a reception desk and offices. Twenty odd paces take you through a lounge, housing the Masters trophy, to the back door and the course. A spiral staircase leads to the library, an informal dining room with additional seating on the veranda. The Champions Locker room - officially the Masters Club Room - is to the rear. \"The clubhouse has grown over the years but it is still attractive and comfortable, not glitzy at all,\" said Alliss.\n     Another tradition adding to Masters lore, wide-eyed amateurs are invited to stay, for a modest (and undisclosed) sum, in the eaves of the clubhouse during Masters week. The five-room dormitory is reached from the library via an unmarked door which leads into a small hallway. \n     On one side there is another door to the Champions Locker Room. Plenty of young men have stumbled, accidentally or otherwise, into the exclusive domain of Masters winners. Opposite, behind another non-descript door, is the steep staircase to the Crow's Nest and its unmistakeable glass cupola.\n     Among former residents to have won the Masters are Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods. Tales of 'Nesters' abound - one has Nicklaus getting reprimanded for abusing the club's hospitality by having two steaks a night as a 19-year-old in 1959.\n     The most exclusive place in this most exclusive of clubs, the domain of the few is another Masters mystique. Behind a door marked \"Masters Club Room - private\", past champions get to change, eat, gossip and gripe in seclusion. Twenty-eight oak lockers with brass nameplates line the room, with two players to a locker. Adam Scott shares with Gary Player. \"Gary gets a lot of mail so there's not much room for my stuff,\" says new incumbent Scott. \n     If the visual splendour and waft of pine and cut grass isn't enough of an assault on the senses, the Masters keeps your ears busy too. The roars greeting great shots reverberate around the pines, which act like the reeds in a giant mouth organ, especially on the lower parts of the back nine where the noise is coralled.\n Phil Mickelson is a three-time Masters winner and hugely popular with the Augusta crowds\r\n       A Sunday roar has a deeper, more urgent resonance than a Thursday roar. And a Woods or Mickelson roar tops the lot. \"To feel that energy and to hear the roars and be a part of what's happening that final nine holes, it's the greatest experience for a professional golfer,\" says 'Lefty'. \n     The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     reads like a who's who of golf and reinforces its status. Jack Nicklaus tops the pile with six wins followed by Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods on four. Phil Mickelson, Nick Faldo, Gary Player, Sam Snead and Jimmy Demaret are on three each. This week marks the 25th anniversary of Faldo's first win. His third victory in 1996 is still the last by a player from Britain and Ireland. Europe's last winner was 15 years ago, when Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal won his second Green Jacket.\n     There is more to winning a Green Jacket than just piecing the parts together. Sure, you need a bit of length off the tee, have pin-point precision with your irons, chip and putt like a God and keep a lid on the nerves, but a sprinkle of magic helps, too. \n  Media requires JavaScript to play. 2005 Masters: Tiger Woods chips in on 16     Witness \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     or Mickelson's six iron through the trees on 13 in 2010, or Bubba Watson's wedge from the woods on 10 in 2012. \n     \"When your eyeballs are flashing because your heart is hitting you so hard in the chest from inside out and you've got to deal with degrees and inches, it's a hard game. But somebody is going to pull it off and when they do, they're revered for it,\" said Azinger.\n ",

By Sunday they are going to be pretty dicey.\"\n     McIlroy, who claimed the \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and the \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     carded four birdies and three bogeys during his round.\n     Early momentum with two birdies inside five holes was checked with a dropped shot on eight and three putts on the par three 12th saw him lose another stroke.\n     He focused on claiming birdies on the back nine's two par five holes and admitted he would have been \"really happy\" with his day had he avoided the dropped shot at the last.\n     \"The greens are firming up, the wind was all over the place, it was a good day at the office,\" added McIlroy, who forms part of the final group to play on Friday, with a tee time of 18:59 BST.\n     \"If conditions stay the same and they put the pin positions in tough spots, it will be tough to get your ball close, so anything even par, one under, two under is a good score.\n     \"I'm feeling good with my game and came in here relaxed to try and enjoy the week. If I can do that and not get ahead of myself then hopefully I'll give myself a great chance.\"\n     Holes two and 13, both par fives, played the easiest on the course, with 81 of the day's 250 birdies being claimed on the pair.\n     England's \n     \n    a top-15 finisher in each of the last four years, said he \"didn't make enough\" of the opportunities the par fives presented after carding a one-over 73.\n     \"That's where you're scoring on this golf course,\" said Westwood, who was in the day's final group.\n     \"It was a bad draw being out last. You sort of sigh when you see the draw. That's as hard as it will play all day. I will be out a bit earlier on Friday and hopefully it's more scoreable.\"\n Lee Westwood failed to record a birdie on any of Augusta National's par fives on day one of the the Masters\r\n       On a day where 19 of the 97-strong field finished under par, England's \n     \n     winner of the 2013 US Open, finished on four over.\n     Compatriot \n     \n    finished seven over par having suffered a quadruple bogey on the ninth, where he received a two-shot penalty for grounding his club in the bunker. \n     \"Left my bunker shot in the bunker and touched the sand before my next shot,\" tweeted Donald, who is yet to win a major. \"A pretty dumb mistake.\n     \"I can accept the odd poor shot but making a mistake like that is pretty frustrating and so unlike me. Nothing I can do about it now, brush it off and try and make a bunch of birdies tomorrow.\"\n     Meanwhile, England's 19-year-old amateur \n     \n     gave himself \"six or seven\" out of 10 after shooting a four-over 76 on his Masters debut.\n     Matthew Fitzpatrick took five fewer putts than McIlroy on day one but only found eight of 18 greens in regulation and consequently finished five shots worse off.\n     The Sheffield-born player, who qualified as 2013 US amateur champion, was playing with defending champion Adam Scott and said the Australian, who is tied for second with Louis Oosthuizen and Bubba Watson on three under, seemed to have the ball \"on a piece of string\".\n     If Fitzpatrick - a Sheffield United fan - makes the cut on Friday, he may well be in action while his team play in the FA Cup semi-final against Hull City on Sunday.\n     \"If you would have said to me last year my soccer team would get to the semi-final of the FA Cup and I'd play at Augusta, I'd just never, ever believe you in a million years,\" he said.\n     Scotland's \n     \n     also a Masters debutant, reached three under at the turn to feature prominently on the leaderboard, but three bogeys in successive holes saw him drop away - eventually finishing on one under.\n     \"I was happy to get under par and stay in the red,\" said the 39-year-old. \"I played with Sandy Lyle, Jose Olazabal and Miguel Angel Jimenez in practice.

        "article": "    Britain's six-time winner David Weir was beaten by Swiss rival Marcel Hug in a thrilling sprint finish to the London Marathon wheelchair race.\n     Hug, 28, who won last weekend's Paris Marathon, proved strongest, clocking one hour 32.41 seconds for his first win in London.\n     Weir was a second behind Hug with South African Ernst van Dyk in third.\n     American Tatyana McFadden set a new course record of 1:45.11 to defend her women's title.\n     McFadden is back wheelchair racing after winning a \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     event at the Sochi Winter Paralympics.\n     David Weir did everything he could have done out there. He raced smartly and his tactics were spot-on but Marcel was just too strong. \n     That is a big win for Marcel. When he glanced over his shoulder in the final sprint I thought he might have gone too early, but he timed it well.  We've always known he is a top racer but he couldn't beat David in London and then won five golds in Lyon when David wasn't there. Now he has beaten him and it sets it up nicely for the season ahead.\n     She finished a minute and a half clear of Switzerland's Manuela Schar and Japan's Wakako Tsuchida with Britain's Shelly Woods sixth (1:54.52).\n     \"I can't believe I won this one,\" McFadden, 24, told BBC Sport. \"I was so nervous coming here after the demands of Sochi but I surprised myself.

It is great to compete against David Weir and also great to beat him.\"\n     Weir himself has vowed to return next year to try and break the record of six wins he holds with Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson.\n     \"I felt mentally and physically in good shape coming in,\" he said. \"I knew I was pushing well but Marcel was the better man on the day but I will fight on until I get that record.\"\n ",

It would be ideal if he could appoint a new coach before Roland Garros, as Wimbledon follows hard on its heels, but finding the right person is not an exact science and it may well take longer. Murray is planning on doing more thinking than playing over the next week, before heading to Valencia to begin his preparations for the Madrid Masters.\"\n     \"There's a lot of factors you need to look at and I would hope I would have someone in place by the French Open, but I don't want to rush it.\n     \"I don't want to get someone just because they've won a lot of tournaments or were great players.\"\n     Murray and Lendl enjoyed a hugely successful two-year period together in which the Scot won Olympic gold followed by the US Open and Wimbledon titles.\n     Since having back surgery last September, Murray has slipped to eighth in the world rankings, and he will need to perform well over the clay-court season if he is to get back near the top four - and the higher seeding that brings - by the time he defends his Wimbledon title in June.\n     \"[A new coach] needs to be the right fit for you and they need to get on well with your team too, because otherwise it's very hard to make it work,\" said Murray, who was speaking \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     where his friend \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \"It's going to be an exciting few weeks because getting a new coach can make big differences, as you saw with Ivan.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play.

And it could have been more, but prop Craig Huby spilled the ball going over.\n     Two goal-line drop-outs and a big contribution from replacement Alex Walmsley gave St Helens the momentum to pull a try back on 27 minutes when second-rower Soliola took Wilkin's pass to power his way over.\n     Luke Walsh's goal made it 18-6 but the Tigers struck again nine minutes before half-time when Shenton scooped up a wayward pass from Turner to sprint 40 metres for his second try.\n     Cas left the field at half-time to a standing ovation but Wellens, unused throughout the first 40 minutes, led his team out for the start of the second half, and that turned the game.\n     The Tigers had a third try disallowed when full-back Luke Dorn was ruled to have benefitted from obstruction, and Saints struck with two tries in seven minutes.\n \r\n\t\t The boys have got a lot of respect for him and, as far as captains go, and I don't think there's any better around \r\n\t     Full-back Lomax took a return pass from centre Josh Jones to touch down wide out before right-winger Makinson, Super League's top try scorer, produced one of his now trademark flying finishes to touch down one-handed in the other corner - his ninth of the season.\n     Walsh had the misfortune to strike the woodwork attempting to convert both second-half tries to leave his side trailing by 10 points, and Castleford looked to have made sure of victory on 59 minutes when Carney won the race to Sneyd's kick to the corner.\n     However, Turner collected Wilkin's kick on 68 minutes to start the fightback, Wellens then finished off a thrilling cross-field move and Swift gathered Wilkin's pass to cross for the winner.\n      \n     \"It's disappointing. It was new Cas in the first half, then old Cas in the second half. I thought the second half was very poor from us.\n     \"We allowed a team that can play a fair bit of rugby league back into the game.\n     \"There are some hard lessons to be learned. I thought we should have won the game. I'm not sure the video ref got all the decisions right, but I'm not going to blame anybody but us.\"\n      \n     \"He's an amazing player and an amazing captain for us. It's no coincidence that when 'Wello' went on the field the commitment from each player was better.\n     \"The boys have got a lot of respect for him and, as far as captains go, and I don't think there's any better around.\"\n      \n     Dorn; Clare, Shenton, Webster, Carney; Sneyd, Finn; Lynch, Clark, Huby, Hauraki, Holmes, Millington.\n      \n     Milner, Massey, Boyle, Mariano.\n      \n    Lomax; Makinson, Turner, Dawson, Swift; Wilkin, Walsh; Masoe, Roby, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Soliola, Manu, Jones.\n      \n     Laffranchi, Wellens, Walmsley, Greenwood.\n      \n     6,487\n      \n    Ben Thaler\n ",

        "article": "    Crystal Palace beat a lacklustre Aston Villa to secure a third successive Premier League victory and move seven points clear of the relegation places. \n     Palace created the better chances, although Cameron Jerome needed to clear Ciaran Clark's header off the line. \n     Jerome hit the crossbar, while referee Howard Webb appeared to award Palace a penalty only to reverse the decision. \n     Jason Puncheon found the bottom corner to secure a vital win and leave Villa only four points above 18th. \n     Prior to the match, Palace manager Tony Pulis said not even a victory over Villa would ease the fear of relegation but the Welshman will be a lot more relaxed than his counterpart Paul Lambert.\n     Palace improved as the match progressed and deserved the three points which take them to 12th in the table, seven points ahead of third-from-bottom Fulham, having played a game fewer than their London rivals. \n     Villa, perhaps understandably for a team attempting to avoid a fourth consecutive league loss, seemed nervous but that tension will only increase as the prospect of Championship football remains a real possibility. \n     They enjoyed the majority of possession, but it was a familiar tale for a side that has struggled to score this season, especially in the absence of injured top scorer Christian Benteke.\n     Jerome, Palace's biggest threat in the opening stages, booted the ball away three yards from his own goal when Julian Speroni seemed beaten by a Clark header.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Paul Lambert plays down relegation fears     Grant Holt went close for Villa, before Yannick Bolasie's penalty appeal was turned down when he went down under pressure from Holt, but no contact had been made.\n     Palace were engineering the best chances, with Bolasie and Jerome again at the centre of the action after the break. \n     Bolasie forced an acrobatic save from Brad Guzan and Jerome, two yards from goal, directed the rebound onto the crossbar. \n     Palace continued to threaten. Bolasie went close from close range, a Puncheon free-kick forced Guzan into action, and referee Webb initially awarded a penalty to the hosts before changing his mind after consulting with an assistant referee. \n  Media requires JavaScript to play. I'm just doing my job - Pulis     Again, Bolasie was the source of Villa's troubles but replays proved Nathan Baker had not handled the forward's cross. \n     Ultimately, it mattered little as moments later Bolasie found Puncheon and the former Southampton man outmuscled Ryan Bertrand to score and become Palace's leading scorer in the league. \n     Villa's best moments came after they fell behind, with Holt wasting a great chance and Speroni stopping a fine Andreas Weimann effort. \n      \n     \"We are a million miles from where we want to be. \n     \"Anyone who knows me will tell you my ambition. If you can't win a game of football it is what happens. We have to win a game of football.\n     \"You're in that group and the only simple solution is to win the next game, that gives you the breathing space.\"\n      \n    \r\n  \r\n\n           Match ends, Crystal Palace 1, Aston Villa 0.

'La Decima' ('The 10th') has never strayed far from their thoughts. \n \r\n\t\t Win, and their poor finish to the league campaign will be  excused \r\n\t     More than a decade later, they are still waiting and the yearning has grown into an obsession which makes Arsenal's recently concluded gap between trophies look like a mere mild hankering.\n     Therefore, ahead of Saturday's Champions League final against Atletico Madrid, Real are precariously teetering with one foot on the edge of glory and the other on the verge of immense disappointment.\n     In the high-pressure and extreme environment of the Bernabeu, at the most glamorous and hype-ridden club in the world, there is no middle ground.\n     Win, and the current Los Blancos crop will be hailed as milestone-marking legends; lose, and they will be castigated as inexcusable failures.\n     Win, and their poor finish to the league campaign - where they finished third behind Atletico and Barcelona - will be retrospectively excused as a period of physical and mental preparation for an even bigger prize; lose, and it will be condemned as the ill-fated onset of careless sloppiness.\n      \n    4-3 v Stade de Reims\n      \n     2-0 v Fiorentina\n      \n     3-2 v AC Milan\n      \n     2-0 v Stade de Reims\n      \n     7-3 v Eintracht Frankfurt\n      \n     2-1 v Partizan Belgrade\n      \n    1-0 v Juventus\n      \n    3-0 v Valencia\n      \n    2-1 v Bayer Leverkusen\n     An objective and balanced analysis of Carlo Ancelotti's first season as Real boss should conclude that it has been good, if not spectacular. He has introduced a new style of play to replace Jose Mourinho's cut-and-thrust, counter-attacking approach, integrated a number of new signings and secured a trophy in the form \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     However, in the eyes of many fans and certainly in the judgement of the frenzied Spanish media, none of that really matters right now. \n     The only thing that counts is whether Ancelotti can finally end his club's long wait for their 10th European crown; if he doesn't, his work over the course of the campaign will be forgotten and his job, seemingly so secure less than a month ago, will come under threat.\n     This drastic, disproportionate state of affairs derives from Real Madrid's utter obsession with success on the European stage.\n     It is a long-held mentality which was sparked by their initial emphatic success on the continent, winning the first five European Cups after the competition was inaugurated in 1955. Those triumphs allowed Real to foster feelings of superiority over the rest of Europe and especially their bitter rivals Barcelona, whose first trophy did not come until 1992.\n     By then, Real were already on six and within a decade they had raced to nine by claiming the silverware again in 1998, 2000 and 2002, when France star Zidane's volley \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     over Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park.\n Zinedine Zidane, Real Madrid's match-winner in the 2002 Champions League final, is now assistant coach\r\n       This week, the Real camp has been attempting to play down the burden on their shoulders to realise the 12-year dream, with Ancelotti insisting they should simply be happy to be in the final (\"a lot of teams will have to watch on television\") and his players claiming they should be regarded as underdogs.\n     Added spice, of course, is provided by the fact that Real's opponents are their local rivals and \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     in the first-ever European final between two teams from the same city.\n     And while Real have been desperately trying to persuade themselves and the watching world that they do not feel under pressure, that genuinely is the case for Atletico, who come into the game knowing they have already wildly exceeded all expectations.\n     About 200,000 Atletico Madrid fans celebrated their team's La Liga title last weekend by heading to their traditional meeting place, the Neptuno fountain in the city centre, where captain Gabi clambered to the top of the 250-year-old statue of Neptune to plant an Atletico scarf around his neck.\n     Less than a mile away, Real fans also have a time-honoured place of celebration: the Cibeles fountain, named after the Greek goddess who is depicted in a statue riding a lion-drawn chariot. In keeping with tradition, skipper Iker Casillas decorated Cibeles with a Real flag after his team's Copa del Rey victory over Barcelona last month.\n     One way or another, tens of thousands of Madrilenos will be heading either to Neptuno or Cibeles on Saturday evening. But which one?\n     Diego Godin's header at the Nou Camp last Saturday, which secured their first league title in 18 years, means that Atletico have nothing to lose and everything to gain; even if they are defeated this weekend, they will still be history-making winners in the eyes of their supporters. \n     Those Atletico fans have been, naturally, revelling in \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     An estimated 200,000 of them filled the streets of Madrid on Sunday, hailing their heroes as they made a triumphant appearance at Atletico's traditional place of celebration, the Neptuno fountains near the famous Prado museum in the city centre.\n     \"We'll be here again next Saturday,\" was one of their most heartily delivered songs, illustrating the exuberant and confident mood of Atletico fans as they head into only their second European Cup final.\n     There is, of course, great expectation on both sides, with Real fans quickly snapping up all 80,000 free tickets to watch the game on giant screens inside the Bernabeu.\n     But the attitude of the respective supporters is markedly different, with Atletico euphoric after their title success and ready to welcome their players as heroes irrespective of the result, while Real know the judgement of their entire season rests upon the outcome.\n     Adding to Real's worries is a selection dilemma for Ancelotti following the suspension of midfielder Xabi Alonso, who plays a fundamental role in knitting the team together, though they have been boosted by the news that Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale are \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     It was no coincidence that Real first started to look like a coherent unit this season only after Alonso returned from injury in November. The former Liverpool man's positional sense, calm passing and experience provides the glue to hold the team together, and his absence has created a huge problem for Ancelotti.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Real Madrid will win Champions League final - Figo     That is especially the case considering the difficulties experienced by the most obvious replacement, Asier Illarramendi, who has struggled to fill Alonso's shoes since his arrival from Real Sociedad last summer and has recently looked desperately low on confidence.\n     Other options are presented by 22-year-old Casemiro, a more physical presence who lacks experience after only starting four games all season, or Sami Khedira, but the Germany international has only just returned from a serious knee injury and is naturally suited to a more advanced role. \n     Worries over Alonso's absence and the effect it will have upon the team's structure and balance are only serving to enhance the atmosphere of tension around Real's preparations for the final, and there is no doubt - they are the team under pressure. \n     How they can cope with that burden may well be a decisive factor in determining whether La Decima will finally be theirs or whether their agonising wait will continue.\n ",

        "article": "    The next round of the battle between Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will take place on their own doorsteps when glamorous Monte Carlo plays host to Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix. \n     Hamilton withstood pressure from Rosberg to edge victory in Spain - his fourth successive win - as the German was forced into second place again. \n     In doing so, the 2008 world champion seized the championship lead for the first time in 2014, moving three points clear of Rosberg. Can Hamilton extend that lead on the streets of Monaco or will Rosberg respond following his victory there last year? \n  Media requires JavaScript to play. The magic of Monaco     Drivers will try to master the twists and turns of Monaco's street circuit while fans will witness the sight of F1 cars kissing barriers. And sometimes smashing into them. \n     Hamilton targets a fifth successive win this season, while Rosberg aims to win his second Monaco Grand Prix in a row - everyone else tries to stop Mercedes winning. \n     Sebastian Vettel thinks Red Bull could rival Mercedes on the streets of Monte Carlo, Ferrari are targeting their first victory since Barcelona last year, Williams continue their push for a first podium since May 2012.\n     As the world's second smallest country behind Vatican City, Monaco swells to breaking point for five days in May when the Formula 1 teams roll in.\n     \"Monaco is an anachronism, but what a wonderful one it is.\n     \"The claustrophobic streets of a Mediterranean principality built on a cliff are no place for a Formula 1 car, and yet the combination works to stunning effect, producing its own kind of magic.\n     \"To watch a grand prix car driven around here is to suspend a sense of disbelief - at the brutal speed of the machinery and the breathtaking skills of its driver.\n     \"The other side of Monaco is money - more is allegedly made here in deals than at all the other races combined.\n     \"In that sense, the Monaco Grand Prix effectively encapsulates a sport in its single most high-profile race.\n     \"A unique sporting spectacle and a licence to make and spend lots and lots of cash, all wrapped into one; in many ways, Monaco is Formula 1.\"\n     Fans can get right up close to the action, sitting in grandstands peering over Armco barriers to see their favourite drivers whizz by, while those who can afford it take in the action from any one of the multi-million pound yachts in the harbour or from the balconies of Monaco's many five-star hotels. \n     The track itself is a physical and mental challenge with the slightest mistake being heavily punished. The average lap speed is just 151kph, and the drivers are on full throttle for 54% of the lap - but with barriers at every corner and little to no run-off, the spectacle is just as thrilling. \n     It is the only track to feature a tunnel, the slowest corner on the F1 calendar - the Fairmont hairpin - and it doesn't even have a podium, with the three drivers walking up the red carpet to the royal box to receive their trophies. \n     The glitz and glamour always attracts the celebrities, with the likes of Will Smith and the Manchester City squad enjoying the hospitality and access to the grid on race day in recent years. \n     Frenchman Olivier Panis won the war of attrition in the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix, the Frenchman being the first of only three drivers to cross the line and finish the race to clinch his first and only F1 win. \n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Classic F1 - Monaco Grand Prix 1996 extended highlights     Damon Hill took the lead from pole-sitter Michael Schumacher, with the German then losing control of his Ferrari at Mirabeau later in the lap.\n     Williams' Hill built up a sizeable lead before a gearbox issue saw his race end on lap 40. Benetton's Jean Alesi inherited the lead, but his suspension failed 20 laps later. \n     Panis, who had been making good progress in his Ligier, then found himself in the lead, with McLaren's David Coulthard behind and only five other cars still in the race. \n     Eddie Irvine then crashed in the same place as Ferrari team-mate Schumacher. As he tried to rejoin, he was hit by the Tyrrell of Mika Salo, who in turn was hit by the McLaren of Mika Hakkinen. \n     Only Heinz-Harald Frentzen was still running, in last place, but he pulled into the pits on the penultimate lap, so everyone else had seen the chequered flag. \n     Panis gave Ligier its first win in 15 seasons, with Coulthard finishing second and Johnny Herbert third. Frenzten was classified fourth, ahead of Salo and Hakkinen. \n     \r\n  \r\n\n ",

        "article": "    Nicola Cortese soaks up the Milan sunshine, far from the troubles that ended his reign as Southampton chairman in January, far from the madding crowd.\n     Wearing a crisp white shirt, a sharp blue suit and a smile not often seen while he was at St Mary's, he is opening up for the first time \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     the Premier League club five months ago.\n \r\n\t\t I can't blame anyone who criticised me, but I have always felt facts are stronger than words \r\n\t     \"I can only look back at things in a positive way, but it is only when you step away that you realise how much you had to sacrifice,\" says the 45-year-old Italian.\n     \"I am trying to catch up with those things. Some things I will never catch up on, but my children and my wife are happy to have me back.\"\n     We meet in a quiet corner of central Milan, a short stroll from the city's spectacular cathedral, a few miles from the footballing mecca of San Siro. \n     \"Southampton became my life,\" he adds. \"I was working seven days a week, 24 hours a day, whether I was in the office or not.\n     \"When you work so intensively like that, you have to readjust your life when you stop. I found it tough for two, three days, but I am not someone who dwells on things. I don't have regrets.\"\n     He talks me through the final few days of his time in charge of Southampton. When had he known that the time had come to walk away? \n     \"Christmas,\" he says. \"I knew at Christmas time.\"\n     Had the players suspected something was not right? Had the club's manager, Mauricio Pochettino, known? \n Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with a move to Tottenham\r\n       \"Not directly,\" he says. \"I am somebody whose emotions you can read in my face. I was worried that people would recognise something was not right, so I simply did not appear as often at the training ground.\n     \"I kept my distance; I did not get as close, but doing that raised some question marks of its own.\" \n     The courtyard garden in which we meet hums to a soundtrack of impassioned chatter that all but drowns out the clinks of glass and cutlery as well as the nearby rumble of renovation work.\n     Cortese looks relaxed and content, but when I raise the subject of Southampton owner Katharina Liebherr, his answers become more carefully worded, more thoughtful.\n     He talks around the subject, never mentioning Liebherr by name, refusing to be drawn into criticism of her.\n \r\n\t\t For any business, especially a football club, if you don't have progression and you are standing still, you risk failure. We had to move on \r\n\t     \"I could not see a way forward together,\" he says. \"As simple as that.\"\n     Cortese had helped to buy Saints for Katharina's father, Markus, in 2009, but when he died of a heart attack in August 2010, his daughter took control.\n     When I ask whether he could have done more to repair a working relationship that broke down irrevocably over a period of six months and more, he responds: \"That is not a question for me to answer.\n     \"I think I proved enough over five years. There wasn't anyone doubting what else we could have achieved.\" \n     Had he felt emotion at the way it ended? \"I never allowed myself to be led by emotion,\" he says. \"The emotions came afterwards.\"\n     Would he ever go back? \"Never.\"\n     Since his departure, Cortese has been accused of leaving the club with \u00a327m of unpaid transfer fees. Did he leave a financial mess behind? \"I don't know what changed. Because on the day I left the financial situation looked quite brilliant. Everything we had done had been budgeted for.\"\n     What of Pochettino? Was there a moment on 15 January, the day he left, when he thought the manager might follow him out of the club?\n     \"No,\" he says. \"There was never any doubt about his future.\n     \"There was no doubt in his mind as well. First of all, he was contractually bound, but he had a duty to stay.\"\n     Former Espanyol boss Pochettino had \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     as the little-known Argentine to replace Nigel Adkins, a decision that attracted widespread scorn. \n     \"I can't blame anyone who criticised me, but I have always felt that facts are stronger than words,\" says Cortese.\n     \"The facts now prove that it was the right move.\n Nigel Adkins was sacked to make way for Pochettino despite guiding Saints to two promotions\r\n       \"I didn't consider it to be a risk, even though everyone said it was going to be meltdown, that we were going to be relegated. I expected criticism.\n     \"I replaced an English manager who gave us two promotions with someone no-one had heard of and who didn't speak English.\n     \"Nigel did a good job. It was just that we weren't progressing further. For any business, especially a football club, if you don't have progression and you are standing still, you risk failure. We had to move on.\"\n     Cortese explains what he had to do.\n     \"As a club, we had a clear philosophy set, how we believed we could be successful in the Premier League, the way we wanted to play,\" he says.\n \r\n\t\t I am a perfectionist; I always believed that little things made a big difference \r\n\t     \"That wasn't set the day Mauricio came in - that was set in April 2012. That made it easier for me because I knew what I was looking for when we made the change.\n     \"When I spoke to Mauricio, I was 100% convinced it was going to work.\"\n     Decisions such as the one to sack Adkins prompted some to describe Cortese as a ruthless chairman who did not understand the game.\n     \"There were some critics who were characterising me as something I wasn't,\" he says. \"You always think that might affect your family.\n     \"While I was somehow a public person, I didn't like being a public person. I wasn't constantly in the press telling people about what we were doing, the way we were doing things.\n     \"I put all my energy to what we were doing within, not outside. In the future, I may be more open but it is not natural for me.\"\n     Another criticism was that he was too powerful.\n     \"Maybe,\" he says. \"But when I joined the club I had to do that to convince people to follow me.\n     \"After we got to the Premier League, I could have said anything and the staff would have followed me, but until then there was no evidence.\"\n Cortese holds aloft the League One trophy\r\n       So what was the future for a club that he joined in the lower reaches of League One?\n     \"Once we got promoted to the Premier League in 2012, we started a new five-year plan,\" he says.\n     \"We were 18 months into that. We had an exciting team, not only this season but for next season.\n     \"The question for us was not if we could win the Premier League but how.\" \n     He adds: \"If you don't think of winning the league, you will never even get close or get close to getting into the Champions League.\n     \"I am a believer that it is not the money alone that makes the difference. We didn't have the resources that other clubs have. We had to be smarter, find different ways.\" \n     Attention to detail and marginal gains were one such way.\n     \"It is about perception,\" says Cortese. \"It is about what people see every day when they come to work. Is the road wiped? Is it clean? Or do they have to walk through mud or a construction site?\n     \"I am a perfectionist; I always believed that little things made a big difference.\"\n     Would he ever be able to transplant his success at Southampton to another club?\n     \"I don't think there is another Southampton to be done, but there are opportunities at every club,\" he says.\n     \"I know I will get into running a football club. I can't tell you the details at this moment. I am in Milan because I like Milan, but everyone who knows me knows I am most interested in the Premier League.\"\n     So can we expect to see him back in football soon? \"Maybe,\" he says with a smile. When I suggest he looks like he knows something, he simply responds \"maybe\".\n ",

Nine months ago, they were \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     If two England footballers heading to this year's World Cup were set to celebrate their first anniversary, coverage would be difficult to avoid.\n     Back in January, former Premier League player \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \"to move the discussion about homosexuality among professional sportspeople forwards\".\n     However, hockey's same-sex wedding sparked little coverage beyond congratulations. There was no discussion - players say none was needed.  \n     \"We are a couple, we love each other and we happen to be playing in the same team,\" says 34-year-old Kate Richardson-Walsh, the England captain.\n     \"I feel quite proud that I was brought up around hockey, where there have been lots of different ethnicities, religions, sexualities and so on. It's normal, and I feel proud of that.\n     \"We're very professional in that we draw a line and when we're at hockey we are Kate and Helen, hockey players and team-mates. \n     \"Away from hockey we're Kate and Helen the couple. It's important that line is drawn and to be able to say to each other 'that's not good enough', and not start having a row about it afterwards.\n     \"We do talk about hockey at home. We don't row about it but we have really good debates because we're so passionate about the game and passionate about the squad.\"\n     On the field, Kate and 32-year-old Helen have led the restoration of Britain as a hockey force. \n Kate and Helen may not play as England team-mates again, with Kate retiring after the Commonwealth Games\r\n       \r\n  \r\n\n     Team GB's first Olympic hockey medal in two decades, would have been unlikely without influential defender Kate Walsh and tireless midfielder Helen Richardson.\n     Off the field, when they became the Richardson-Walshes, team-mates believe the couple demonstrated how little trouble hockey has with diversity - a word, and concept, some other sports have struggled to manage.\n     \"The culture of hockey is so much more open. We're so lucky to be hockey players. Everyone is just accepted for who they are,\" says Beth Storry, who played in goal for Britain at the London Olympics and whose partner is Dutch defender Chantal de Bruijn. \n     \"Ever since I've been young, hockey has been a very open environment if you're gay or lesbian. I couldn't imagine playing in a sport where you couldn't be yourself and not be open about who you are.\n     \"With football, I think it's a great shame - the odds are there are probably a lot of gay men playing in the Premier League. It's a shame you can't be open, you can't be who you want to be. In hockey, nobody judges you, nobody questions you.\"\n     The Richardson-Walshes made their Olympic debuts together at Sydney 2000 but only became an item at the Beijing 2008 Games, after Walsh had broken off her engagement to Brett Garrard, the former England and GB men's hockey captain.\n     The two came through London 2012 to win bronze despite Kate \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     in the opening group game, leaving Helen to deputise as captain - and worry not only about her loved one undergoing emergency surgery, but also about leading a team now missing a key player.\n     Kate missed just two games, returning to action with a plate in her jaw and a protective mask. \n     But now, two years later, something far more painful has happened.\n Kate posted this selfie on Twitter prior to England's first EuroHockey final in 22 years. England lost 2-0 to Germany in a penalty shootout after a 4-4 draw\r\n       With \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     beginning in the Netherlands at the end of this month, Helen has been \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     The sport's star couple will be temporarily torn apart.\n     Having suffered longstanding problems with a ruptured disc in her back, Helen had major surgery earlier this year, followed by an intense battle for fitness ahead of the tournament.\n     The selectors decided she had not done enough.\n     \"I know in time everything will be okay. For now though, it hurts,\" she wrote on a blog documenting her rehab.\n     The World Cup is the sport's pinnacle, alongside the Olympic Games. Winning the title had been one of her lifetime ambitions.\n     \"I've lost the chance to achieve a goal of mine that, not only have I worked incredibly hard for over these last 11 weeks, but absolutely and completely dedicated my life to, 100%, for the past 15 years,\" she added.\n     \"I have no idea when I'll get to the acceptance stage. I keep fluxing between the anger, bargaining and depression stages, meaning I'm not much fun to be around at the moment.\"\n     An emotional Kate, speaking on the \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     is almost in tears as she recalls the moment she realised Helen had not made the squad. \"I kept on refreshing my emails. When it arrived I scanned for her name and it wasn't there. It's just really sad,\" says the England captain.\n     \"She'd got herself back playing and because there was a month to go, with her experience and what she brings to the team - I am biased - I would have had her in the squad.\n     \"I got myself to the point where I really believed her name would be on the sheet.\"\n     She must now lead England at the World Cup knowing her partner and team-mate of more than a decade is sitting at home.\n     \"Kate's going to have to concentrate on the World Cup, yet at the same time needs to care for Helen. But you also just know they're going to get on with it,\" says Storry, 36, who retired from international hockey after London 2012.\n     \"They're very good at keeping it separate - it's very much business when you're on the pitch, and your private life is separate. \n Kate Richardson-Walsh captained Great Britain in 2012 to their first Olympic medal since 1992 - only the second in their history\r\n       \"It helps when your partner understands hockey and what it takes to play at that level - to know that when you're going off training again, getting up at a stupid time, or only talking about hockey, it's because you love it.\"\n     Kate is now set to retire from the international scene - she will don an England shirt for the last time this summer, looking for the major title that has so far eluded her.\n     \"This is my last season playing in the international team and this potentially could have been the last tournament Helen and I played together, if she'd been selected,\" she says.\n     \"All of those things make it harder. My emotions are heightened because it is my last season. They say you kind of just know, and I know it is time.\"\n     On her blog, Helen wrote: \"There's nothing more I would like to see than my wife, Kate, lift the World Cup.  \n     \"Of course, I wanted to be by her side when she did, but we've both shared so many highs and lows, and she truly would be worthy of this success.\"\n      \n ",

        "article": "    At the end, Terry Butcher summed it up, his tone a mixture of jaded pride and cautious optimism. \n     The Hibs manager reeled off the monkeys his team had just removed from their backs: \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \"The lads are in the dressing room and \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Quite. \n     Jason Cummings was one of them. Eighteen-years-old and the saviour of the evening for Hibs. \n     Two goals that lifted his team out of their depression, the first a thump from distance that eluded Hamilton goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert, the second a delicate chip that crossed the line before being hoofed clear.\n     \"Oh aye, I knew it was over the line,\" said Cummings, later. \"Definitely. No doubt about it.\" Then he paused. \"It was, wasn't it? It was over the line, aye?\"\n     Even in victory, Hibs were second-guessing themselves. \n \r\n\t\t  It was a pleasing result - and a hugely important one - but the night did nothing to dispel the doubts about this team and the need to knock it down and start again in the summer \r\n\t     All the darkness above this football club and now, finally, some brightness, some relief. \n     A two-goal advantage going into the second leg of this play-off on Sunday. It'll surely be enough; a goalless night would have left them vulnerable to failure at the weekend in a home ground that has so often been hostile to the very players it's supposed to inspire. \n     Even a one-goal advantage would have been fragile when factoring in the Easter Road effect. \n     Their results there have been lamentable for so long. But two? Butcher has been through the mill so often this season he was not inclined to declare survival as job done. But it's close. Accies have goal-scorers in their ranks, but they'll need something special now. \n     Following Hibs around the country these past months has had more than a touch of the groundhog day. Different destination but same familiar story: defeat, defeat, defeat.\n Jason Cummings fired a double in Hibs' victory at New Douglas Park\r\n       New Douglas Park was a new stop on the journey, Accies something of a free-scoring and trash-talking outfit in the build-up. The hosts gave Hibs some verbals in the preamble. \n     Oh, how they let them have it. Preying on their nerves; highlighting their run of failure. Their goading words hit the newspapers. Butcher said he ripped out the pages and put them on his training ground wall. \n     Being Butcher can't have been fun. He had done everything to rouse his players out of a monstrous slump: encouraging, pleading, bullying. Nothing cut it. Nothing. The more he tried to fix it the worse it got.\n     So this is how we got to this point. Wednesday night in a near-packed stadium with a home crowd sensing weakness and blood. We arrived armed with the usual dossier of Hibs calamities.\n     The eternity it had been since they won. The numbers that illustrated their powder-puff attack and their vulnerabilities in defence.  \n     They say you can prove anything with statistics - it's just the way you present them that counts. It's not true. There was no way you could present those Hibs numbers in a way that lessened their embarrassment. \n     The biggest boffin couldn't twist the stats in Hibs' favour. They've been wretched. \n     In their bid to score the goal - the goals - that would make Sunday's second leg a test rather than an awful torment, Butcher went with two strikers. \n     To some of us it looked like the rearranging of the chairs on the Titanic. Cummings, with zero goals in his 16 senior games for his club, partnered Paul Heffernan, who has scored four in 20, or to put it another way, one in 14. \n Hibs recorded their second win in 20 matches \r\n       Butcher has players who can score goals, but before last night they'd forgotten how to. That's been but one of the manager's problems. James Collins sat on the bench. \n     A recruit from England. Eighteen goals in League One last season, including a hat-trick against Stoke in the Capital One Cup. But only six for Hibs and none in the last 15 games; a barren run of almost 14 hours without a goal.\n     Beside him on the bench, a January addition, Danny Haynes. He used to be decent once, too. He played for Charlton in the Championship last season. Scored seven times in 20 games; scored the winner against Leicester and Burnley, the two teams who a season later secured automatic promotion to the Premiership. \n Hibs are in a commanding position ahead of the second leg at Easter Road on Sunday\r\n       By and large, Haynes played against the same Leicester and Burnley defence that took them to the promised land a few weeks ago. Not a bad player. Not a world beater, but good enough for Scottish football.\n     But no. Haynes has scored once in 10 games for Hibs. One goal in 9.8 hours. Butcher himself has suffered this way. \n     Going along nicely in second place in the Premiership with Inverness Caledonian Thistle when the call came from Edinburgh. Admired for his work this season and last. We spoke about the Butcher Bounce when he fetched up at Easter Road, but everything fell flat. \n Hibs fans were given reasons to be cheerful\r\n       It's as if the lot of them lost what ability they had as soon as they crossed the door.  \n     Thirty-nine minutes into this play-off Cummings rifled his effort on the Accies goal and found a keeper incapable of dealing with it. Later, he delicately lofted a ball over the same man and scored a second. It was Cummings's night. When this team really needed somebody to show leadership and ability it was a teenager who delivered in the most decisive way.\n     He said he was \"overwhelmed\" by the response from the Hibs fans, as well he might be. There was a rawness about the reaction from the visiting support, an unmistakeable release of a pressure-valve. \n     Few of the Hibs fans - or their manager - will be fooled by this, though. It was a pleasing result - and a hugely important one - but the night did nothing to dispel the doubts about this team and the need to knock it down and start again in the summer. \n     They have work to do on Sunday and then a big job to do in the summer. Cummings eased the Hibee pain but his goals can't disguise the gaping problems that exist. \n     They will likely survive - and what a relief that will be to them and to the Premiership as a whole - but is that what it has come to for Hibs? Or is there ambition in the place? \n     At New Douglas Park they came up with an answer to one question, but so many more still exist.\n ",

At Wimbledon, for example, this year's \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     - a huge rise on the \u00a311,500 they received in 2011.\n Liam Broady has finished second in the boys' singles competitions at both Wimbledon and the US Open\r\n       But can they go one step further? Would the All England Club consider subsidising players on the Futures tour? \n     \"It's not something that we have ever done in the past,\" chairman Philip Brook admitted.\n     \"But I think that it's an interesting idea because this is a sport-wide problem and people often look to the Grand Slams to take a leadership role in these areas. \n     \"The Grand Slams have done that, I think, in terms of the prize money at their own tournaments, but that isn't to say that we couldn't take a wider look at it and try and help a larger group of players.\"\n     They would not just be subsidising a tour, but also a Wimbledon player of the future - a player who might otherwise have to take his talents elsewhere in an attempt to make ends meet.\n      \n ",
