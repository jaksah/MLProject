        "article": "Four women have had new vaginas grown in the laboratory and implanted by doctors in the US. A tissue sample and a biodegradable scaffold were used to grow vaginas in the right size and shape for each woman as well as being a tissue match.   They all reported normal levels of \"desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction\" and painless intercourse.  Experts said the study, published in the Lancet, was the latest example of the power of regenerative medicine.  In each woman the vagina did not form properly while they were still inside their mother's womb, a condition known as vaginal aplasia.   Current treatments can involve surgically creating a cavity, which is then lined with skin grafts or parts of the intestine.  Doctors at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centre in North Carolina used pioneering technology to build vaginas for the four women who were all in their teenage years at the time.  Scans of the pelvic region were used to design a tube-like 3D-scaffold for each patient.  A small tissue biopsy was taken from the poorly developed vulva and grown to create a large batch of cells in the laboratory.  This is an exciting glimpse into the future of medicine. Using living tissue as building material to transform the lives of patients has already happened with bladders, blood vessels and windpipes. Now you can add vaginas and noses to the list.  There are even attempts to make more complex organs. Weakly beating hearts, and kidneys that can produce urine, have been made in animal studies. But this is still a long way from being used in humans.   Expect 3D printing to revolutionise this field as the technology to precisely place both the cells and the scaffolding improves. Muscle cells were attached to the outside of the scaffold and vaginal-lining cells to the inside.  The vaginas were carefully grown in a bioreactor until they were suitable to be surgically implanted into the patients.   One of the women with an implanted vagina, who wished to keep her name anonymous, said: \"I believe in the beginning when you find out you feel different. \"I mean while you are living the process, you are seeing the possibilities you have and all the changes you'll go through.  \"Truly I feel very fortunate because I have a normal life, completely normal.\"  All the women reported normal sexual function.  Vaginal aplasia can lead to other abnormalities in the reproductive organs, but in two of the women the vagina was  connected to the uterus.   There have been no pregnancies, but for those women it is theoretically possible. Dr Anthony Atala, director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest, told the BBC News website: \"Really for the first time we've created a whole organ that was never there to start with, it was a challenge.\"  He said a functioning vagina was a \"very important thing\" for these women's lives and witnessing the difference it made to them \"was very rewarding to see\".  This is the first time the results have been reported. However, the first implants took place eight years ago.  Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Basel in Switzerland have used similar techniques to reconstruct the noses of patients after skin cancer.  It could replace the need to take cartilage from the ribs or ears in order to rebuild the damage caused by cutting the cancer away. Prof Martin Birchall, who has worked on lab-grown windpipes, commented: \"These authors have not only successfully treated several patients with a difficult clinical problem, but addressed some of the most important questions facing translation of tissue engineering technologies.   The steps between first-in-human experiences such as those reported here and their use in routine clinical care remain many, including larger trials with long-term follow-up, the development of clinical grade processing, scale-out, and commercialisation.\" ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. High speed cameras have revealed flies manoeuvre in a similar way to fighter jets  New research shows that when a threat comes into view fruit flies make split-second turns reminiscent of those made by fighter jets. High speed videos revealed the subtle wing movements that enabled them to make the split-second \"bank\" turns in order to evade attack. The study explains why other species of fly are hard to swat, according to the research team. The work has been published in the journal Science. One of the researchers, Prof Michael Dickinson of Washington University in Seattle said that the aim of the research was to learn more about how flies process visual information. It's like putting a newborn baby in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft and it knowing what to do\u201d \"They process this information so quickly, as anyone who has tried to swat a fly will have noticed,\" he told BBC News. \"And they can fly like an ace at birth. It's like putting a newborn baby in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft and it knowing what to do.\" Prof Dickinson's collaborator, Dr Florian Muijres, also at Washington University, said it was \"quite a mystery\" how they change direction so quickly. \"These flies do a precise and fast calculation to avoid a specific threat and they are doing it using a brain that is as small as a grain of salt,\" he said. The researchers captured the flight of fruit flies in a purpose built cage using three high speed cameras. They frightened the flies by flashing up an image of a looming predator and observed closely how the flies changed course. What was remarkable, according to Prof Dickinson, was that the change in wing beats was barely discernable. \"You might imagine that when a fly is doing such a crazy manoeuvre that there would be a big change in how it flaps its wings. But it is actually remarkably subtle. It shows the flies' nervous system and muscles are able to control movements to a very, very fine scale,\" he said. The team observed that the flies could completely change direction by rolling their bodies and a slight flick of their wings within five milliseconds.  The next step is to observe what happens in the brains of the flies as they carry out these ultra-fast changes in course.  Prof Dickinson and his team are building what is in effect a flight simulator for flies. The insect is kept stationary but the illusion is created that it is flying. Scientists then monitor which neurons are activated as the flies avoid objects that suddenly appear in their way. Professor Graham Taylor, who is carrying out similar research at Oxford University, said fruit flies turn to avoid fast-approaching objects in the same way as an aircraft - by throttling up, and pitching or banking their body to redirect the force they produce.  \"What is so remarkable is the rapidity of the response, and the subtlety of the changes the flies make to their wing beat,\" he said. \"The flies start turning away from approaching threats in half the time it takes you to start blinking at a camera flash, and finish throttling up their flight motor in one-fiftieth of the time it takes you to complete the blink. It is little wonder we find them hard to swat.\" ",

        "article": "Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has staged a minor coup over coalition energy policy. Conservative newspapers have been demanding a cap on onshore wind farms, but the Lib Dems have refused to agree. So Mr Pickles has taken personal charge of wind farm applications for a further year, allowing him to block proposals for new turbines. In a six-month trial period he has so far accepted one proposed wind farm and rejected seven. A source at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), controlled by the Liberal Democrats, accused him of playing politics with energy policy to appease backbench MPs. But Mr Pickles said it was vital to give local people more say over wind farm applications. RenewableUK, which speaks for the renewable energy industry, said one man was effectively in charge of all planning applications for wind farms in England.  Deputy chief executive Maf Smith said: \"Telling local authorities that they can't decide on wind applications runs counter to the principles of the Localism Act, and introducing more delays is anti-business. The extension is a costly mistake for the UK. \"I expect the official planning bodies for this country will be up in arms that the planning system is being subjugated to political whim in this way.\" The source at DECC said it was too soon to tell the full effect of Mr Pickles' intervention. Many projects were already held up in the planning process because Mr Pickles was too busy to oversee applications. In a statement Mr Pickles said that, prior to planning guidance issued by the coalition to give more weight to local concerns, more appeals had been approved than dismissed for significant wind turbines.  He added: \"Since the guidance, more appeals have been dismissed than approved for significant turbines. But I do appreciate the continuing concerns in communities. \"Therefore after careful consideration I have decided to extend the temporary change to the appeals recovery criteria and continue to consider for recovery appeals for renewable energy developments for a further 12 months.\" Follow Roger on Twitter  ",

        "article": "Climate scientists meeting in Berlin have been accused of \"marginalising\" the views of developing countries.  They are preparing to release a key report on how the world must cut carbon emissions to stem dangerous warming. They are likely to say that if significant action isn't taken by 2030, temperatures will quickly break through the 2 degree C threshold. But a lead author told BBC News that this focus on cutting CO2 was ignoring the development needs of the poor. \"The narrative, the language, the views of the IPCC still marginalises the developing country perspectives,\" Dr Chukwumerije Okereke, from Reading University, told BBC News.  Quite frankly this is reinforcing historical patterns of injustice and domination\u201d Dr Okereke was a lead author on chapter four of the new report, dealing with sustainable development and equity.  He believes that there has been a fundamental shift in the discussions because the issue of historical responsibility for carbon emissions has been watered down by richer nations who are more concerned with the future than the past.  \"The argument has been shifting away from the view that the developed countries, who have been mainly responsible for the problem, should take leadership in solving it, to this centre-ground view that we are all in it together and we all have to do our share. \"In effect, this is shifting the burden onto the developing countries and is holding them down from developing; quite frankly this is reinforcing historical patterns of injustice and domination.\" In a leaked draft of their report, the IPCC authors write that cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide from 1750 to 1970 were around 900 billion tonnes. But when you measured the emissions between 1750 and 2010 they had soared to 2,000 billion tonnes of CO2.  Further emphasising the recent trend, the draft points out that between 2000 and 2010, emissions grew at 2.2% per year, compared to 1.3% over the period between 1970 and 2000.  To keep temperature rises below 2C, widely accepted as the threshold to dangerous change, carbon emissions in the atmosphere by 2100 have to be between 430 and 480 parts per million (ppm).  On current projections, the world would go through the 430ppm by 2030, so the report says that emissions cuts must happen soon. The report indicates that the majority of future emissions growth will take place in developing countries.   This question of past and future is a big bone of contention between the parties meeting here in Berlin. \"I think one of the big battles is the definition of historical responsibilities and the estimation of it,\" said Martin Khor, who was a co-ordinating lead author of chapter three of this report but resigned, he says, because of the overwhelming amount of work involved.   \"Developed countries are more likely to say, let's look into the future, the future runs from 2005 to 2100, and you will find that a lot of the emissions are coming from developing countries.\" Dr Okereke says that a big part of the problem is that there are not enough authors on the IPCC from developing countries.  \"This IPCC is a very genuine effort to reflect the underlying science, but in the end it does not fully capture the views from developing countries because the overwhelming majority of the authors are from the developed world.  \"They come with loads of secretaries and helpers, they bring their PhD students along, but the few of us from developing countries are not able to match the force of intellectual firepower that comes from them.\" Dr Okereke's views on the involvement of authors from developing countries are supported by Martin Khor, who says the lack of representation has serious implications for the tone of the report. \"Most of the accepted literature is published in developed countries and the authors are predominantly western,\" he says.  \"It doesn't mean they are wrong but they don't have that same sympathetic consideration of developing country problems as they are not living in those conditions day to day.\"  The IPCC said it is working hard to increase the number of authors from the developing world.  \"As someone from a developing country myself, this is an issue of which I am well aware,\" said the Panel's chairman Dr Rajendra Pachauri.  \"About 30% of the authors for the Fifth Assessment Report come from developing countries, a share which has gone up with each successive assessment, and I am sure that figure will continue to rise in the years ahead.\" Follow Matt  .

        "article": "Governments are likely to be warned next week that a \"dash for gas\" will not solve climate change.  The chancellor and prime minister have promoted gas as a clean option for powering the UK. But a draft report for the United Nation's third panel on climate change says gas cannot provide a long-term solution to stabilising climate change.  Gas is only worthwhile if it is used to substitute a dirty coal plant - and then only for a short period, it says.  Instead the world should be trebling or quadrupling the share of renewables for electricity, the authors say. The report will offer ammunition to the Department for Energy and Climate Change, which has fought attempts from the Treasury to switch more of the UK's energy sources to gas with the projected \"shale gas revolution\". The UK hopes to emulate the success of the US, where shale gas has slashed energy prices and stimulated manufacturing. However, the draft report backs the position taken by the Environment Agency chairman, Chris Smith, who has told the prime minister the UK could only expand the role of gas in power generation if power stations were fitted with carbon-capture equipment to suck carbon dioxide from exhaust gases and store them in underground rocks. The UK is currently committed to trialling this technology in a gas power station in Peterhead. But the technology is so far untried at scale. It also adds to the cost of gas burning and reduces the efficiency of power stations. The UN report draws an implicit difference between a nation like the US, which has seen a huge fall in emissions by switching from coal to gas, and a country like the UK, which enjoyed its \"dash for gas\" in the 1980s and has since passed the Climate Change Act, requiring an 80% emissions cut across the UK by 2050. Some Conservatives want the act to be repealed and it is not yet clear whether the party's election manifesto will reflect their views.  Labour and the Liberal Democrats back the act. One senior Conservative told me many of his backbench colleagues were heavily influenced by the Mail on Sunday's campaign to define climate change as a con trick. Elsewhere, the UN's draft report spells bad news for coal-exporting countries.  It warns that their exports are likely to be hit as the world turns its back on the fuel. This paragraph may prove contentious as governments discuss the final draft. ",

The ocean liner sank on its maiden voyage 102 years ago, with the loss of more than 1,500 lives. The new analysis found the iceberg risk was high in 1912, but not extreme, as has previously been suggested.  The work by a University of Sheffield team appears in the journal Weather. The iceberg which sank the Titanic was spotted just before midnight on 14 April 1912, some 500m away. Despite quick action to slow the ship and turn to port, it wasn't enough. About 100m of the hull buckled below the waterline and the liner sank in just two-and-a-half hours.  Reports of unusually bad ice in the North Atlantic started to emerge shortly after the disaster. At the time, US officials told the New York Times that a warm winter had caused  . In the days leading up to that fateful night, the prevailing winds and temperatures, assisted by ocean currents, had conspired to transport icebergs and sea-ice further south than was normal at that time of year.  All this has led researchers to seek explanations for a supposedly awesome flotilla of ice in the North Atlantic. One US group has proposed that an unusually   caused abnormally high tides in the winter of 1912, which in turn encouraged a greater than usual amount of ice to break off Greenland's glaciers. \"From the moment we left Belfast we had marvellous weather. Even when we got out on the western ocean - the Atlantic as you probably know it - it was as smooth as the proverbial millpond. Not a breath of wind and the sea like a sheet of glass.  In any other circumstances those conditions would have been ideal. But anyone with experience of ice at sea knows that those very conditions, and the moonless night, only render the detection of icebergs more difficult and call for the additional alertness of both officers and men.\" In the latest study, Grant Bigg and David Wilton from Sheffield University's department of geography studied data collected by the US Coast Guard and extending back to 1900. Observational techniques have changed over the years, complicating comparisons. But the researchers say that a good measure of the volume of icebergs is given by the number that passed the circle of latitude at 48 degrees North, across an area of ocean stretching from Newfoundland to about 40 degrees West. They found that the record showed great variation in the volume of ice from year to year. And although the iceberg flux from Greenland in 1912 was indeed high, with 1,038 icebergs observed crossing the 48th parallel, this number was neither unusual nor unprecedented. In the surrounding decades, from 1901-1920, there were five years with at least 700 icebergs crossing 48 degrees North. And the coast guard record shows there was a larger flux of icebergs in 1909 than in 1912. Prof Bigg told BBC News the flux was at the \"large end\" but \"not outstandingly large\" for the first 60-70 years of the 20th Century. Using the coast guard record and other data, the researchers also developed a computer simulation to examine the likely trajectories of icebergs in 1912. Using this model, they were able to trace the likely origin of the iceberg that sank the Titanic to southwest Greenland. They suggest that it broke off a glacier in that area in early autumn 1911 and started off as a floating hunk measuring roughly 500m long and 300m deep.  Its mass by mid-April 1912 - as predicted by the computer model - agrees very closely with the size of an iceberg bearing a streak of red paint that was photographed by Captain William Squares DeCarteret of the Minia, a ship that joined the search for bodies and wreckage at the site of the disaster.

Satellites of the GLONASS network experienced a half-day outage when bad data was uploaded to spacecraft.  map shows a GLONASS receiver at Harwich giving corrupted position fixes that were off by more than 50km. The Authorities say the 2 April event is a timely reminder that alternatives to satellite navigation are essential. The GLA themselves are supporting a system in the UK and Ireland called eLoran, which transmits long-range position, navigation and timing signals from a ground-based radio network. Its primary use is for ships and others in the maritime sector, but there is a feeling also that eLoran could provide a robust back-up for GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo when it arrives. Galileo is the European sat-nav system, which is in the process of roll-out. A   found that the UK was becoming dangerously over-reliant on what are termed Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Use of space-borne positioning and timing data is now widespread, in everything from freight movement to synchronisation of computer networks.

Receivers needed to be capable of switching seamlessly between a variety of data sources, the RAEng expert panel argued. \"GLONASS is used by quite a lot of people, actually; the iPhone-5 can pick up its signals,\" explained Prof David Last, a consultant engineer and past president of the Royal Institute of Navigation. \"What we saw last week was many people being affected by the GLONASS failure even with receivers that were also picking up GPS.   \"The lesson that comes out of this is not just that satellite-navigation systems are vulnerable, but that you don't get a protection by simply plugging in a second satellite-navigation system.   \"You need something that is different and doesn't share common modes of failure,\" he told BBC News.

        "article": "A new burrowing robot for anchoring miniature submarines has been developed - inspired by the humble razor clam. \"RoboClam\" could be used to lay undersea cables, and potentially even destroy mines, its inventors say. The device mimics the digging action used by razor clams to turn solid soil into liquid \"quicksand\", helping them slide through. A prototype is   by engineers from MIT in Boston, US. The cool thing is this technology is already 10 times more efficient than any anchor\u201d They set out to design a new low-power, light-weight anchor for  \"Luckily, nature had already done the work for us,\" said Dr Kerstin Nordstrom, of the University of Maryland, who collaborated on the research. The answer was poking out of mudflats off the coast at nearby Gloucester, MA. The Atlantic razor clam,  , has been dubbed \"the Ferrari of underwater diggers\". An animal of its modest frame (10-20cm) should only be strong enough to penetrate 2cm into packed sand. But it can burrow up to 70cm in just over a minute. Compared to existing anchor technology \"the razor clam is about 10 times more efficient,\" Dr Nordstrom  . To dig for half a kilometre, it would only use the energy in an AA battery. \"But when you try plunging the shell into the sand, it doesn't actually penetrate very far,\" said Dr Nordstrom. \"What this shows is the clam must be actively doing something to the ground when it digs.\" To find out the razor clam's secret, they studied its digging action and modelled it mechanically. The repeated open-shut of the clam's valves turned the hard-packed soil around it into quicksand. \"The clam's trick is to move its shells in such a way as to liquefy the soil around its body, reducing the drag acting upon it,\" said Amos Winter, of MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering. \"Pushing through sand costs a lot of energy. But if the sand is excited, it's actually very easy. That's the trick,\" added Dr Nordstrom. By mimicking the action of the razor clam, they built their own robotic prototype - which has achieved the same digging speed - about 1cm per second. The first \"RoboClam\" can only reach 20cm, and requires a significant rig of machinery to propel it. But having demonstrated the principle, the team now aims to develop a larger, self-contained unit, that can burrow more than 10 metres. This could be used to anchor larger vessels, and may have military applications - such as detonating mines, the researchers suggest. \"The cool thing is this technology is already 10 times more efficient than any anchor. If we can keep scaling things up, some day it will affect big boats,\" said Dr Nordstrom. \"Also - undersea cable installation is happening more and more frequently. If we can do it more efficiently we can save costs and cause less disturbance to the environment,\" she said. Amos Winter agrees: \"Having a system that could just latch onto the cable, work its way along, and automatically dig it into the soil would be great,\" he said. ",

It was \"one of the most challenging Ebola outbreaks we have ever dealt with\" and could take another four months to contain, the WHO said.  The virus had now killed 101 people in Guinea and 10 in Liberia, it said. Ebola is spread by close contact and kills between 25% and 90% of its victims. Many West African states have porous borders, and people travel frequently between countries.  Southern Guinea is at the epicentre of the outbreak, with the first case reported last month.  The geographical spread of the outbreak is continuing to make it particularly challenging to contain - past outbreaks have involved much smaller areas. \"We fully expect to be engaged in this outbreak for the next two to three to four months before we are comfortable that we are through it,\" Keija Fukuda, WHO's assistant director-general, said at a news briefing in Geneva, Reuters news agency reports.  The WHO said 157 suspected cases had been recorded in Guinea, including 20 in the capital, Conakry.  Sixty-seven of the cases have been confirmed as Ebola, it added.  In neighbouring Liberia, 21 cases had been reported, with five confirmed as Ebola, WHO said.

        "article": "Scientists have produced their most precise measurement yet of the rate at which the early Universe was expanding. They find that some three billion years after the Big Bang, the cosmos was pushing itself apart by another 1% every 44 million years. It is the latest result to come from the  . The international group clocks the expansion by making detailed maps of the distribution of matter in space. The hope is such studies can provide further insights on \"dark energy\". This is the mysterious force that appears today to be driving the cosmos apart ever more quickly. What is interesting about the new result is that the BOSS-measured expansion rate 10 billion years ago is quite a bit slower than that expected from the  . \"This is the most precise measurement that's ever been done, and all I'll say at the moment is that there is a tension there,\" explained Dr Matthew Pieri, a BOSS team-member from Portsmouth University, UK.  \"We expected to see the Universe expanding faster than what we found.   \"The disagreement could still be a statistical fluke, or it could be that the Universe was different to how we thought it was, but we'll have to explore this further to find out.\"  Theory holds that the Universe has been on a rollercoaster-like ride. From the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, it expanded rapidly - but that expansion decelerated in the first few billion years under the constraining influence of gravity. Then, some six billion years ago, the cosmos started to speed up again under the influence, scientists suspect, of dark energy. The BOSS group has determined both the near and far expansion rates. And while the near values fit very well with expected numbers, it is the new result for the far Universe that is the cause of some head-scratching. Two largely independent measurements have been made.  One is to map the distribution of quasars, which are extremely luminous, distant galaxies. The second measure involves using the light from those quasars to pinpoint the positions of clouds of hydrogen gas along the line of sight to Earth. In both instances, the BOSS team is probing so-called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). These refer to the pressure-driven waves that passed through the post-Big-Bang Universe and which subsequently became frozen into the distribution of matter once it had cooled to a sufficient level. These oscillations show themselves as a \"preferred scale\" in the distribution of matter.   For example, in the near Universe, there is a slight excess in the numbers of galaxies with separations of about 500 million light-years. BAOs can be used as a kind of \"standard ruler\" to measure separations and distances through the entire history of the cosmos. The new BOSS information does this for a sample of quasars and gas clouds over a quarter of the sky. Because it uses a 2.5m telescope in New Mexico, this sample is predominantly in the northern sky above the plane of the Milky Way. To be able to measure the Universe in its deceleration phase - which BOSS has done - is a remarkable enough result. But to get a number lower than expected is potentially very exciting.  It may be that the apparent divergence will simply disappear with further measurements that make use of bigger samples. However, if it does not, it could hint for the first time that dark energy is not a cosmological constant, as has been the assumption for more than a decade.   Perhaps, rather than having a fixed value, it varies with time or space or some other physical parameter. \"We're not jumping up and down at this stage and saying it's time to re-write the whole of cosmology,\" observed Prof Bob Nichol at Portsmouth. \"But this is the kind of thing that can balloon into new thinking.   \"We've assumed that dark energy is a constant and this approach has been very successful so far. \"But as we take more data and push down into the noise, it is possible something new will emerge.   \"It is also possible, of course, that as we take more data, the tension simply goes away. But we have to go where the data takes us and today the data is tantalising.\"        and follow me on Twitter:  ",

The little world has excited scientists ever since jets of icy material were seen squirting into space from a striped region at its south pole. Now, exquisite measurements using Nasa's Cassini probe as it flew over the moon have allowed researchers to detect the water's gravitational signal.  reports the details. \"The measurements that we have done are consistent with the existence of a large water reservoir about the size (volume) of Lake Superior in North America,\" Prof Luciano Iess told BBC News. A European comparison would be 245 times the water mass of Lake Garda in Italy. The findings of Prof Iess and his team will boost the view that the 500km-wide moon would be one of the best places beyond Earth to go look for the existence of microbial life. Cassini's data suggests the liquid volume lies about 40km under Enceladus's ice crust. This would put it directly on top of the moon's layered, rocky interior.   The case for a subglacial ocean has been growing ever since Cassini first sensed a  . Subsequent observations pinned the source of this atmosphere to mineral-rich streams of water vapour flowing away from surface fractures dubbed \"tiger stripes\" for their resemblance to the markings on a big cat. Cassini even flew through the plumes to \"taste\" their load of salts and organic (carbon-rich) molecules.  I think Enceladus has gone to the top of the charts in terms of a place where there could be life\u201d Enceladus's orbit around Saturn is eccentric - it is non circular. The giant planet's gravity should therefore be expected to squeeze and stretch the little moon as it travels this path, heating some of its ices and melting them.  Some of the resulting liquid could then be hurled into space through the deep tiger fractures, although quite how this happens is not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, the new work reinforces this general picture. It has involved measuring tiny changes in the speed of Cassini as it passed through Enceladus's own gravitational field. These changes in velocity were as small as 20 millionths of a metre per second.  They enabled Prof Iess and colleagues to map variations in the distribution of mass on the moon.   The large anomaly they spotted in the data at the southern pole is best explained by the presence of a big volume of water. \"What we see is consistent with a water pocket of about 8-10km in depth, and this pocket can extend up to southern latitudes of 50 degrees around the pole,\" the Sapienza University of Rome researcher explained.  Media requires JavaScript to play. There is evidence water is contained in 'tiger stripes' on one of Saturn's moons There is strong evidence to suspect the existence of sub-glacial oceans at a number of Solar System moons. Saturn's largest satellite, Titan, probably has one. Similarly, the Jupiter moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto would fall into this class; and perhaps even Triton at Neptune.  Of these, Enceladus and Europa draw the most interest because it is more likely that their water would be in contact with rock.  This could make for some interesting chemistry - the sort of reactions that might facilitate the emergence of life.  Prof Andrew Coates, of the UK's UCL-Mullard Space Science Laboratory, commented: \"I think Enceladus has gone to the top of the charts in terms of a place where there could be life. \"It's got several of the things which you need for life - there's certainly the presence of heat, there's liquid water in this ocean, there's organics and that type of chemistry going on. \"The only question is, has there been enough time for life to develop?\" Prof David Stevenson, from the California Institute of Technology, added: \"We don't have an answer to that, but there are some theoretical ideas.  \"First, let me say that the ocean that we have found could keep things going for tens of millions of years, maybe 100 million years, but, of course, we don't know whether the ocean is being added to at present or is freezing up.   \"And, maybe, Enceladus does go through cycles and those cycles would be related to the eccentricity of the orbit. It's possible that the orbit has not always had the same eccentricity.\"  and follow me on Twitter:  ",

The yellow sac spider is attracted to the smell of petrol, and will weave its web in engines, causing a blockage and build-up of pressure. The problem increased the risk of fire, Mazda said. A software update will be applied to recalled cars to monitor the pressure level and warn drivers of any danger. Mazda said it was unaware of any fires being started due to the vulnerability, but it has been a problem that has plagued the company since at least 2009.  Specifically, it is Mazda 6s from the 2010-12 range that are covered by this latest recall.  It involves around 42,000 vehicles, according to filings made to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. , Mazda explained: \"A certain type of spider may weave a web in the evaporative canister vent line, potentially causing a restriction in the line.  \"If this occurs, the fuel tank pressure may become excessively negative when the emission control system works to purge the vapours from the canister. \"As the canister is purged repeatedly during normal operation, the stress on the fuel tank may eventually result in a crack, potentially leading to fuel leakage and an increased risk of fire.\" Owners of cars affected would have the fault fixed free of charge, the company added. In 2011, Mazda attempted to address the the problem by fitting covers over engine vents to prevent the spiders crawling in - but this was only partially effective, with particularly determined yellow sacs still setting up their homes in the vehicles.  When   why the spiders were causing so much trouble, a Mazda spokesman said: \"Don't ask me, I'm terrified of the damn things.\" ",

The European Commission says it is Europe's  so far of bee colony deaths. Winter mortality was especially high for bees in Belgium (33.6%) and the UK (29%) in 2012-13. But in spring-summer 2013 France was highest with 13.6%. Bumblebees and other wild bees were not studied, nor were pesticide impacts. The study, called Epilobee, described 10% as an acceptable threshold for bee colony mortality - and Greece, Italy and Spain were among the countries with rates below that threshold. The mortality percentages are national estimates based on representative samples. All 17 countries applied the same data collection standards, the report says. The survey covered almost 32,000 bee colonies.  But there is also much concern about death rates among wild bees, which are vital pollinators too. Last year the EU introduced a ban on four chemicals called neonicotinoids which are used in pesticides.  They are believed to be linked to the collapse of bee colonies across Europe, though there is a heated scientific debate over the chemicals' impact and many experts say further studies are needed. The Commission wanted pesticide impacts to be included in the Epilobee study, but it was overruled by member states' governments. ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. David Shukman takes a look at the massive scale of Germany's coal-mining operation A vision for a greener future for the world seems very distant if you descend into the heart of one of Germany's largest coal mines.  While researchers and officials are in Berlin preparing the next report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the country's fossil fuel industry is as busy as ever. The report is expected to set out options to switch from sources of energy that give off the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to cleaner types like wind and solar. This mirrors Germany's own ambitions with a plan known as the Energiewende, best translated as \"energy transition\", which calls for at least 80% of power to come from renewable sources by 2050.  But south of Berlin in the region of Lausitz, down at the coal face in a mine called Welszow-South, machines the size of office blocks gouge out chunks of lignite and low-carbon dreams hardly seem plausible. The lignite, also known as brown coal, is one of the dirtiest, most polluting kinds of fuel, but it helps generate no less than 26% of Germany's electricity. Add in the country's harder black coal as well and you find that nearly half of the country's electricity comes from the one source which climate scientists argue most needs to be phased out.  The challenge is that, for the moment, coal offers a relatively cheap and easy solution, there is plenty of it and thousands of jobs are involved so the mining enjoys robust support from unions and local politicians.  For a country that prides itself on showing green leadership, and hosting the IPCC meeting, the reliance on coal illustrates the sheer difficulty of turning visions into reality. Germany is in the bizarre position of being the world's largest producer of solar power - and of lignite. The dark cliffs of brown coal stretch for miles, exposed to the air for the first time since they formed from a swampy forest that lay along the shores of the North Sea 17 million years ago. Ancient twists of branches, compacted and dusty, lie inside the coal, a reminder of a process that once sucked huge amounts of carbon dioxide out of the air, only for it now to be released back into the atmosphere. The mine is one of several operated by the Swedish state-owned company Vattenfall and its managers are bullish about the prospects. In addition to the lignite already earmarked for extraction, they say there are another 1.6 billion tonnes approved for future mining in this area alone and demand remains high.  The head of operations, Uwe Grosser, is polite about the \"energy transition\" and the advent of renewables but dismisses the idea of a future without coal. \"We're the only ones who deliver constant power. Our power is always there. \"When solar, wind and the renewables are fed into the grid we're the only ones able to adjust our output, that's the only way it's possible to prioritise renewables.  \"If they can't provide power. We can. 24 hours a day. 365 days a year.\" The last time I encountered Vattenfall was in very different circumstances: we were reporting on the construction of its   off the coast of Cumbria.  Here the process of extracting coal has been fine-tuned over the past century. First, one of the largest moveable machines on the planet - a staggering 500m long - eats away at the layers of sand and silt to reveal the lignite.  The drivers are just visible perched in cabs high above the ground as they rearrange the geology.  Then comes the extraction of the lignite itself, a giant wheel grinding through the seam, sharpened scoops each carrying the weight of a small car in coal. On the horizon stands a power station fed by the lignite, a mix of water vapour and exhaust rising from its towers. This is a region whose history is intertwined with that of coal and unpicking that will be no easy feat. Patrick Graichen of the think-tank Agora-Energiewende, which seeks to build consensus on energy, concedes that the future of coal has so far been side-stepped. \"It is a tough challenge because politicians have so far only been focused on the phasing out of nuclear and the phasing in of renewables. \"We didn't look at coal but that's what we need to do and that will be tough because a lot of regions depend on coal.\" And, for the time being, the demand for the coal as a power source gives the operators a massive incentive for expansion. The little village of Proschim stands in the path of one plan to open up a new mine. Dozens of villages have been bulldozed in recent decades to make way for lignite mining but Proschim offers something special. About 40 of its 120 houses are fitted with solar panels, wind turbines spin in the fields nearby and a farm enterprise has started turning agricultural waste into biogas. A large poster proclaims the \"Energiewende\" and this is indeed a model of what the transition is meant to be about.  For Hagen Rosch, whose family have lived in the village for more than a century, the impending destruction of a model green village is the opposite of what the national government is seeking. \"This huge coal mine will destroy the nature, the village, the houses, the life of the people,\" he told me. \"And we produce green energy - we have solar panels and biogas. Coal is the old kind of engineering and the past will destroy the future in Proschim - this is terrible, this is crazy.\" So while the UN climate panel maps out greener options, and Germany tries to put that vision into practice, Proschim could become a test-case, its demolition or survival a pointer to the future.

The researchers said avoiding males helped the females save energy needed for feeding calves, helping them to survive. The study of humpback whales around the Hawaiian Islands showed females with a calf were often pursued by males in deeper waters. This meant the mother and calf had to increase their swimming speed by 75%. However, as water depth decreased so did the number of males following the mother, making females more likely to be found alone with their calves in the shallows. While previous research has shown groups containing a calf tended to be found in shallower waters, the study is the first to systematically investigate whether this is due to mothers avoiding males rather than avoiding predators or seeking calmer waters. The findings have been published in the scientific journal Behaviour. Dr Alison Craig, a marine mammal scientist from Edinburgh Napier University, led the study with colleagues Prof Louis Herman and Dr Adam Pack from the University of Hawaii and The Dolphin Institute. She said: \"There are no long-term social bonds between male and female whales, and the males approach lots of females in the hope that they will get the chance to mate.   \"Our study suggests that unwanted male attention causes females and calves to increase their swimming speed, so mothers need to supply their calves with more milk to compensate for the extra energy they've used.   \"However, the females don't eat while they're in tropical waters, which means that they need to break down their own blubber to produce milk.  Their milk is the only food source for the calves at this time, so you can see why saving energy is so important to females with a young calf. \"It could potentially increase the calf's chances of surviving the migration from the breeding grounds to the feeding grounds.\" She said there was no definite explanation as to why males were less likely to pursue humpback mothers into shallower waters, although a reduced chance of finding suitable mates was a possible factor. Dr Craig said: \"Females who don't have newborn calves are more likely to ovulate than new mothers, and these females without calves occur in deeper waters. \"So if males follow mothers into shallower waters they will be less likely to encounter ovulating females and so will have less chance of fathering a calf.\"   ",

The environment department's original plan was to announce up to 10 new cull areas in south-west England each year. Defra's own   shows that culls in two pilot areas were not effective, and raised questions about their humaneness. These pilot culls will continue, though there will be no independent oversight to assess their future performance. The need for the field trials and required legislative changes mean that a useable cattle vaccine is still many years away\u201d In a Commons statement, the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson proposed a programme of vaccination around the edges of the most badly affected parts of the country. This, he said, would create a buffer zone of immunity that would stop the disease from spreading. \"We have always been clear that there would be lessons to be learnt from the first year of these four-year culls,\" Mr Paterson said.  \"If we do not control TB, the bill will rise to \u00a31bn over the next decade. It is vital that farmers, vets, non-government organisations and politicians work together to free England of TB.\"   The Shadow Environment Secretary Maria Eagle called the pilot culls \"disastrous\" and said Mr Paterson had put \"prejudice before science\". She also said the environment secretary had ignored calls in the House of Commons to seek alternatives to culling. I'm disappointed that this year's culls will lack the independent oversight needed to provide confidence\u201d \"What he's announced now is simply open season on the badgers in the culling areas,\" she said. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, from the Institute of Zoology, told BBC News: \"I think it's excellent news that Defra ministers have decided not to extend badger culling to new areas, when the poor performance of last year's pilot culls raises very serious questions about whether this approach will make a bad situation worse.  \"Continued culling in the Somerset and Gloucestershire area needs to be much more humane, and much more effective, than last year's pilots, and so I'm disappointed that this year's culls will lack the independent oversight needed to provide confidence in those key measures.\" Meurig Raymond, president of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), said: \"As today's strategy sets out, it is hugely important that any cattle controls go hand in hand with measures to tackle the disease in badgers. And culling must play a part in that where TB is rife.\" Mark Jones, executive director of Humane Society International UK, commented: \"Whilst the abandonment of the planned badger cull roll out this year is a welcome U-turn as well as a damning indictment on Defra's failed culling policy, it is nonetheless utterly indefensible that the government is carrying on regardless with its discredited cull in Gloucestershire and Somerset.\"   Media requires JavaScript to play.

He added that some \u00a324.6m would be invested over the course of this parliament in the development of effective TB vaccines for both cattle and badgers. \"In 2013, I agreed with the European Commissioner the work needed to develop a viable cattle vaccine.

The blackthroat, or blackthroated blue robin ( ) is one of the world's rarest \"robins\", being known from only a handful of records since it was first described in the 1890s. In 2011, experts resighted a small number of male blackthroats in China. But now they have sighted a female and a breeding pair, learning more about the robin's behaviour. Details of the discovery are published in the  . The species was first observed in 1886 in Gansu province, north west China. In the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, about 10 individuals were collected at two locations in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces between May and August, during what was thought to the bird's breeding season. Since then, there have been very few records of the species, the bird being occasionally sighted in China and Thailand, with a few specimens appearing in markets that trade birds. The blackthroat is listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and almost nothing was known about its behaviour or breeding. In a bid to relocate the bird, a team of scientists based at the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, visited six national parks in central China, targeting habitats they thought it might frequent. In 2011, they documented 14 males, recording the bird's distinctive song. Since then, they have managed to spot blackthroats, including a breeding female, on numerous occasions within three locations, as well as a nest with two chicks. Many of the birds were found living in forests inundated with bamboo. In total, 58 adult blackthroats have now been observed since the species was first discovered in 1886. Though \"eight of these records, between 1931-2000, have no documentation, and can therefore not be verified,\" cautioned Prof Per Alstr\u00f6m from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, a leading member of the research team. As well as the two chicks most recently spotted, four recently fledged birds were sighted in 1886. The robin remains elusive, and the scientists admit they would not have noticed the birds had they not been singing.  Media requires JavaScript to play. \"The song is beautiful and varied,\" write the researchers in their latest description of the robin's rediscovery. \"It consists of short, varied strophes that are delivered at a fairly slow pace, with pauses of a few seconds between each strophe. Many strophes are rather simple and consist of a few whistled notes.\" The robin also appears capable of mimicking the sounds of other birds, including the grey-headed woodpecker, Chinese sparrowhawk, spotted nutcracker, and Eurasian jay. Their studies have dramatically increased our understanding of the blackthroat. For the first time, the experts, led by Fumin Lei from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof Alstr\u00f6m, who is currently studying in China, confirmed what a female blackthroat looks like; being uniformly grey-brown, with a black bill and paler underside, characterised by a buffish-grey throat and breast.

Blackthroats may be more common than previously thought, as the latest study discovered more individuals than had ever been recorded previously. Its habitat may also be less threatened than feared.

        "article": "The world's leading climate scientists are considering a plan to remove carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere in an effort to stem global warming.  Members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) meeting here in Berlin, will shortly publish a key study on how to curb rising temperatures. One of the techniques they are considering is a little known method called Bio-Energy Carbon Capture and Storage (Beccs).  But critics warn that the technology is unproven and could give reluctant countries an excuse not to cut emissions. The idea of capturing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and storing it underground has been under discussion for over a decade.   The technology has been aimed at large scale, old school power plants that mainly rely on coal as a fuel source.  The idea is to remove the carbon either before or after combustion and pipe it underground so that the invisible gas can be contained in rock formations without leaking. While CCS could, in theory, limit the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere, it doesn't do much for the CO2 already there.  Some researchers suggested that if you combined the carbon capture and storage with bio-energy crops and plants, you could begin to remove emissions that have already been accumulated.  A handful of pilot operations have been tested, although the technology is hardly known outside a small group of experts. \"I don't know which fairytale figure it is, it may be Cinderella, or Sleeping Beauty,\" said Henrik Karlsson, from Biorecro, a Swedish company that has been involved in developing a number of Beccs projects. \"But it is facing a long journey to reach a place where this technology catches the interest of the research industry.\" That journey may be a little shorter thanks to the interest of the IPCC. At their meeting here in Berlin, scientists and government officials are considering a draft report on the measures that can cut emissions.  The scientists argue that time is running out for mitigation measures such as substituting renewable energy for fossil fuels. Some ideas on how to remove carbon from the atmosphere are now being discussed.  Beccs is the only technology currently available that can reverse the trend of emissions in the atmosphere - it makes it a moral obligation to deploy it as soon as possible\u201d In a leaked copy of their report, even though there is limited evidence, the idea of Beccs gets a cautious endorsement. \"Combining bio-energy and CCS could result in net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere,\" it says.  One of the pilot studies took place in France at Artenay, where researchers estimated the amount of carbon that could be siphoned off from a sugar beet refinery.  The beet absorbs carbon as it grows and CO2 is produced in a high quality stream as a by-product of the fermentation process. A scientist who was involved in the Artenay research, Dr Audrey Laude, says the IPCC are right to consider options like Beccs, as she says it is an insurance policy against dangerous levels of warming. \"Without Beccs the modelling doesn't work to keep us under 2 degrees C,\" she told BBC News.  \"We know there will be an over shoot soon and Beccs is necessary because it gives you negative emissions and that is a way of rectifying the overshoot.\" But how much impact can a technology like Beccs really have?  Henrik Karlsson says that in a study carried out by his company in Sweden, you could mitigate all the emissions from the transport sector if you used a Beccs system on all the pulp mills in the country. He is delighted that the idea is being considered at the IPCC. \"We are already in such a bad position that we need all possible mitigation options as well as carbon removal from the atmosphere, and that is the big, big breakthrough of this report from the IPCC, that this is established as a fact,\" he says. However there is much unease here in Berlin about the merits or otherwise of removing carbon from the atmosphere.  Several countries, including Germany and China, expressed reservations about the use of technologies like Beccs in their written comments on the IPCC draft.  Campaigners, concerned about the use of land to grow crops for energy, are also worried about Beccs.  They believe that to be effective as a means of removing carbon from the air, it would require huge amounts of land.  \"To do Beccs on a large scale you need vast areas to grow crops or trees,\" said Almuth Ernsting from Biofuelwatch.  \"What's become clear with the evidence of biofuels is that such large programmes result in massive ecosystem destruction which releases large amounts of carbon and these land conversions has significant impacts on people too.\" Ironically, one of the most promising options for developing Beccs is in tandem with the oil and gas industry. The stream of carbon dioxide that can be separated from the crops being burned or processed can be used to help in the recovery of hard to reach oil deposits.  And it is this close association with fossil fuels that presents many campaigners and scientists with a dilemma over the use of Beccs. \"It gives people the sense that we can get away from burning ever more fossil fuels and this is a wonderful way of getting carbon back out of the atmosphere,\" said Almuth Ernsting.  \"Even if it isn't done, it provides some golden solution out there to justify not cutting emissions.\" Certainly there are major issues ahead for the idea. There are question marks over the storage of carbon dioxide underground, there are few government incentives and perhaps most damningly for Beccs, there are few academic or industrial groups interested in developing it.  \"We are in a classic valley of death for technologies like Beccs,\" said Dr Laude. \"There are no incentives and too many risks. Everybody is waiting for the next step.\" But Henrik Karlsson remains optimistic - he believes that because it is relatively low-tech, cheap and can be used on a wide variety of industries. More importantly he says, we have run out of time to do anything else.  \"The emissions situation is really bad - it is not a moral dilemma it is an actual dilemma,\" he says. \"Beccs is the only technology currently available that can reverse the trend of emissions in the atmosphere - it makes it a moral obligation to deploy it as soon as possible.\" Follow Matt  .

        "article": "Half of the world's population now lives in cities - a proportion that's set to rise to two-thirds by 2050. Yet cities are vulnerable to the worst impacts of climate change precisely because their locations are fixed. As the UN's climate panel meets in Berlin, how are urban centres coping with the test?  by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) re-emphasises the vital role cities can play in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This should come as no surprise, since urban centres are responsible for three quarters of global energy consumption and for 80% of greenhouse gas emissions. \"In a sense, they are the carbon criminals of this world, but they also provide us with really good opportunities,\" says Prof Tim Dixon from the University of Reading, UK. Cities have moved from thinking about how they're going to be affected to what they're going to do about it\u201d One of the ways in which cities can be made greener is through a process called retrofitting. This describes a kind of directed alteration of the built environment to, for example, increase its energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption.  At one level, this might take the form of installing loft and cavity wall insulation, improved boilers, better window glazing or energy-efficient lighting. But while this already occurs in a piecemeal manner, to be effective, retrofitting must occur on scales greater than individual buildings or even neighbourhoods - there has to be an overarching vision.   \"There's no single blueprint that fits every city. But I think successful visions underpin successful cities,\" says Tim Dixon, who is a researcher on the  . Vancouver on Canada's west coast stands out as a city that has already  . The Canadian city involved some 120 organisations and thousands of individuals (through online feedback and face-to-face workshops) in the creation of its Greenest City 2020 Action Plan. The scheme has three overarching areas of focus: carbon, waste and ecosystems.  Among the targets laid out in the document is a pledge to require all buildings constructed from 2020 onward to be carbon neutral in their operation.  You can't unbuild the energy-hungry transport networks, homes and town centres that we've got\u201d Vancouver also wants to halve the solid waste going to landfill over 2008 levels and to ensure more than 50% of trips around the city are made by foot, bicycle or public transport - rather than by car - by 2020. But in the UK, only a handful of cities have climate change strategies taking them up to the middle of this century. Of these, few set targets for each sector, such as transport, buildings or public lighting, for example. But cities such as Bristol and Birmingham have well advanced plans, says Tim Dixon. Bristol's council has drawn up a Climate Change and Energy Security Framework which lays out a strategy for reducing the city's carbon emissions by 40% by 2020 from a 2005 baseline. It has established a \u00a31.2m energy efficiency fund for non-domestic buildings, has embarked on a programme of installing biomass boilers and solar arrays. It is also planning to build six wind turbines at a site near Avonmouth docks, which would produce enough electricity to power several thousand homes. \"Getting the financing right is key. Urban areas have long lives. In 2050, something like 80% of our buildings are still going to be there,\" Prof Dixon adds. \"It's not going to be the 1-2% of new stock that is going to be the key focus. It's about taking the longer-term view - looking at how to retrofit those buildings, but also how to protect them. \"You can't unbuild the energy-hungry transport networks, homes and town centres that we've got. There's a huge amount of lock-in. But the challenges are really around how do we develop partnerships within cities, bring together key stakeholders and how do we enable financing to make a difference.\" Indeed, the disappointing take-up for the UK government's Green Deal scheme looms large in the memory of those who have a stake in greening our cities. Under the deal, householders could borrow money to install double-glazing, insulation and more efficient boilers.  In March 2013, the government said it expected 10,000 people to have signed up to the programme by the end of that year. But by December, only 1,600 households had applied. \"Looking longer term, I'm sure there's a way the Green Investment Bank could help underpin retrofits at a city scale,\" says Prof Dixon.  \"We need to think creatively and imaginatively. In an era of austerity, it's not going to be the public purse that pays for this, the private sector has to be involved, so we have to think about how we can engage them in these kinds of major energy efficiency measures across cities.\" But a balance will have to be struck between strategies aimed at climate mitigation - what we can do to limit or slow further changes - and those based around adaptation - reducing our vulnerability to those effects we can already expect. David Dodman, an expert on climate change and urbanisation, points out that when word clouds are created from the urban chapters of the earlier IPCC reports, the dominant word is \"impacts\", while in the 2014 AR5 document it is \"adaptation\". \"Cities have moved from thinking about how they're going to be affected to what they're going to do about it,\" says Dr Dodman, from the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) in London. Last year, for example, on the first anniversary of Hurricane Sandy, New York's mayor Michael Bloomberg unveiled   from climate change-related flooding.  By the middle of this century, a quarter of the city - home to nearly a million people - will lie in flood zones, according to data from the US emergency agency Fema. So the proposals call for the construction of permanent levees and portable storm barriers in order to meet the challenge.  New York is an example of a metropolis with the infrastructure, the wealth and the political will to deal with the effects of a changing climate. But David Dodman, an author on the urban chapter in the latest IPCC report, says, large numbers of urban centres in Africa and in parts of Asia are much less well prepared. \"The capacities of those cities [to deal with climate change] are not just to do with knowing what those impacts are, they are much more to do with existing infrastructure, with the financial resources at their disposal, to do with the technical capacity of city governments... and on political governance,\" said Dr Dodman. Not every city need respond in the same way as New York to take effective adaptation steps. Coastal urban areas in the tropics could, for example, seed and protect dunes and reforest mangroves to provide protection against future sea level rise.  Dr Dodman uses the term \"soft engineering\" for such adaptive measures: \"It's not quarrying millions of tonnes of concrete to turn into a sea barrier, but more about working with the natural environment,\" he adds. The IPCC's working group 2 report says that cities, and particularly those that are rapidly growing, present an opportunity to meet sustainable development goals. This is in part because their institutions and infrastructure are still being developed and there is at least the potential to shape them in ways that are aligned with green thinking.  However, the report also says there is limited evidence of this being realised in practice. And as the populations of many cities increase, urban communities are springing up in informal settlements, and these groups are often on land that is at a high risk of climate impacts such as extreme weather, and related events such as landslides. In some cases, several factors may act in concert to amplify changes. Some of Asia's \"megacities\" - Bangkok, Manila and Jakarta, for example - face a high risk of flooding because of sea level rise, but are also suffering from land subsidence.  This is often due to extraction of groundwater - a resource that will be placed under further stress as the world warms - and also because of the sheer weight of the built environment on alluvial ground. \"They're sinking as the waters are rising,\" says David Dodman. For effective climate change adaptation, as for mitigation, coherent visions for future cities will be key. Follow Paul  . ",

        "article": "If you take a stroll through one of the nation's long-established woodlands, there is a good chance its management was inspired, influenced or even instructed by John Evelyn's Sylva. Widely recognised as the first comprehensive study of UK trees, Sylva, or - to give its full title - A Discourse of Forest Trees, and the Propagation of Timber in his Majesty's Dominions, made its first public appearance in 1662 as a paper submitted to the newly formed Royal Society.  Two years later, it was published as the Royal Society's first book and went on to not only shape people's knowledge but the landscape itself.  Media requires JavaScript to play. And it was an instant success, proving popular beyond its intended audience of wealthy aristocratic landowners, who were urged by Evelyn to plant trees in order to replenish the nation's depleted timber stock. Four editions were produced during Evelyn's lifetime, and the book is still widely quoted and remains in print and   350 years after its first publication. Although   that recorded some of England's defining historic landmarks - the Civil War, the great plague and the fire of London - he was best known as a horticultural pioneer by his lifetime peers, which included Pepys, Locke and Hooke. He designed his first garden when he was 22 years old, two decades before he penned Sylva. It was as a young man, after deciding fighting as a Royalist in the Civil War was not the best career choice, that he travelled across Europe and became fascinated by the formal gardens of France and the expansive grounds of Italy. On his return to England, he continued his work in the garden of his home at Sayes Court in Deptford, South-East London. Being located near the Royal Dockyard on the Thames allowed Evelyn to experiment with newly arrived botanical delights, testing how the flora fared in his English country garden. His attention to detail, and the careful recording of his observations reflected the appetite for empirical evidence among the early pioneers of modern science.  \"He was one of the early fellows of the Royal Society, which was created in 1660 as a scientific organisation, and Evelyn had spoken with the fellows about his work in this area and it very much chimed with the Society's early objectives,\" explained Royal Society head librarian Keith Moore. What we do now will have a knock-on effect for generations to come\u201d \"Quite clearly, Evelyn's work in planting forest trees and harvesting the products from them - whether it was wood or apples - really hit the mark; it was exactly what the Royal Society was interested in at that time.\" And so the seeds of Sylva's success were planted, as landowners heeded Evelyn's advice. \"Of course, you have to remember that this was after the Civil War so trees across the nation had been denuded as part of the war effort but, as Evelyn himself says in the book, as a result of industrial activities - such as glass making - people were chopping down trees, therefore they had to be replaced,\" he told BBC News.  \"Also, he uses the phrase 'wooden walls' - [trees] were very important for the defence of the nation through ship building.\" Although Evelyn produced structured designs for gardens, he favoured a much less formal use of trees. He favoured woodland \"wilderness\", a preference that - it has been suggested - sowed the seeds of the 18th Century's Landscape Movement, which included the likes of Capability Brown. Mr Moore believes Evelyn's style of writing, which interwove practical advice with poems and stories from classical texts, contributed to Sylva's longevity. \"It is such a comprehensive text; there are a lot of interesting things in there and he is really engaged in his subject. He can express that and I am sure that current tree specialists must love that,\" he observed.  The lasting legacy of Evelyn's vision to sustain the nation's timber supplies was highlighted in 1812 when the book was republished as a call to arms to the nation's landowners as the Napoleonic Wars took their toll on timber supplies. And there were echoes of Evelyn in 1919, the year in which the UK's Forestry Commission was established to increase tree cover, which had fallen to just 5% as a result of the demand for timber during World War One. Today, trees are back in the headlines and on the political agenda. To coincide with the original book's 350th anniversary, two authors have written The New Sylva, a timely updated version for the 21st Century to highlight the strategic, economic and ecological importance of trees. \"I felt there was a real need to reintroduce the idea of wood culture in Britain today,\" explained co-author Gabriel Hemery, a silvologist and chief executive of the Sylva Foundation. \"Trees are more important than at any time over the past few hundred years because they have the ability to help us to adapt to climate change, to produce more green materials for the future, while producing a wonderful, beautiful countryside at the same time.\"  Speaking amid the trees of the University of Oxford's Harcourt Arboretum, Dr Hemery observed: \"As well as [being] a beautiful location, it is also a managed woodland at the same time.  \"One of the core purposes of The New Sylva is to help people to manage and work with trees better.\" Dr Hemery explained that the latest book has also seen the arrival of illustrations, which were absent from Evelyn's editions. The book contains more than 200 original ink drawings by co-author Sarah Simblet. Dr Simblet explained how she struck the balance between the need for scientific detail and finding the space for artistic impression. I go for very long walks through the woods to find my plant material\u201d \"It is something that I have grown to do naturally through, first of all, understanding what it is about this species that I need to explain and how to differentiate it from its closest relative,\" she told BBC News. She added that she achieved a better understanding of the specimen she was working on by holding it in one hand while drawing it with the other. \"This translates straight into the drawing and helps capture the expression of that particular species. I am trying to get personality, texture, scent, volume, form, light and articulation.\" When it came to finding the perfect specimen, Dr Simblet said it was necessary to leave her studio and get up close and personal with nature. \"I go for very long walks through the woods to find my plant material,\" she explained.  \"For this particular project, I researched my 100 species in advance; I walked for weeks as I had about 100 trees around Oxfordshire.  \"I visited regularly at six o'clock in the morning to watch them growing, to see the buds developing and flowering so then I could go back and collect them at just the right time.\" An old Chinese proverb captures the underlying message of both Evelyn's Sylva and The New Sylva: \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second best time is today.\" A long-term outlook and commitment are essential in order to ensure the future success of forests and woodlands, as any forester will attest. Does Dr Hemery think the UK woodlands are in safe hands? \"We have to be in it for the long term,\" he told BBC News.  \"One of the things that I hope the book encourages people to think about is that we are beholden to have a responsibility beyond our own lifetimes because what we do now will have a knock-on effect for generations to come.

The first System 360 mainframe was unveiled on 7 April 1964 and its arrival marked a break with all general purpose computers that came before.  The machines made it possible to upgrade the processors but still keep using the same code and peripherals from earlier models. Later this year the British rival to IBM's machine, the ICL 1900, also celebrates its 50th anniversary. Despite their age, mainframes are still in wide use now, said Barry Heptonstall, a spokesman for IBM. \"I don't think people realise how often during the day they interact with a mainframe,\" he said. Mr Heptonstall said mainframes were behind many of the big information systems that keep the modern world humming and handled such things as airline reservations, cash machine withdrawals and credit card payments.  The machines were very good at doing small-scale transactions, such as adding or taking figures away from bank balances, over and over again, he said.  \"We don't see mainframes as legacy technology,\" said Charlie Ewen, chief information officer at the Met Office, which has been using mainframes for 40 years. \"Mainframes have several characteristics that are enormously valuable for us,\" he said. They are \"resilient, robust and are very cost-effective for some of the work we do\", he added. The Met Office uses its machines to slice its data sets in many different ways for different clients and keeps them running all day every day, said Mr Ewen.  \"The mainframes are the production house of our IT operation and help us provide four million forecasts a day,\" he said. Mr Heptonstall said the introduction of System 360 also changed the way computers were used. \"Before System 360 arrived, businesses bought a computer, wrote programs for it and then when it got too old or slow they threw it away and started again from scratch,\" he said.  Kevin Murrell, co-founder of the National Museum of Computing, said the name IBM adopted for its range of machines dated from an earlier, non-computer, era. Scientific equipment such as oscilloscopes were often built around a \"main frame\" on which customers could choose to put extras or add-ons specific to their research needs. In addition, he said, in the post office the \"main frame\" was the part of a telephone exchange where all the incoming wires were located. \"It was quite a common name,\" he said. In the early days of computers, the size of a mainframe made it easy to distinguish it from other types of computer.  \"If it was big enough to walk around then it was a mainframe,\" he said. \"If you could get it in your living room it was a mini-computer, and if you could carry it then it was a micro.\" Soon after the appearance of the System 360 family, ICL produced its own rival line of mainframes that started with the 1900. A series of events is being planned to celebrate the arrival of that machine and its successors, said Mr Murrell. The machines have a legacy seen on many modern keyboards, he said. The \"escape\" key was a common way to exit from a menu system on a mainframe and the \"SysRq\" key on some keyboards also dates from that era of monolithic computing. \"If you were using a terminal-based system, 'System Request' let you interrupt what you were doing and run another job,\" he said. \"But I'm not sure it's ever had a use in Windows.\" ",

        "article": "Bamboo is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. Sturdy and tenacious, it symbolises virtue. In fact, the plant has had a profound impact on the daily life, culture and spirituality of the Chinese. In the past, a wide variety of products were made from bamboo - from roof tiles and rafts, to shoes, furniture and agricultural tools. But despite the close relationship between Chinese-speaking societies and the natural material, Taiwan's bamboo industry has suffered a decline in recent decades. It nearly collapsed because of people's preference for more modern-looking products, or just cheaper plastic goods - and the impact of less expensive bamboo imports from China and South East Asia. Never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different products\u201d Nowhere was this more apparent than in central Taiwan's Zhushan or \"Bamboo Mountain\" town. Hundreds of families used to make bamboo products there in the centre of the country's bamboo industry. Now there are only about 50. It's a trend reflected in other parts of Taiwan - only about 240 bamboo-products businesses remain on the island. \"In the past, every part of Taiwan had people working in this industry, but over the years, bamboo has been replaced by plastic or steel to make all sorts of products, such as clothes hanging poles, baby cribs, and furniture,\" says Yang Chun-hsien, director of the Forestry Bureau's reforestation and production division. However, an earthquake and strong resolve on the part of the government and industry to continue using bamboo have led to a revival and transformation in its use. In recent years, bamboo has been used to make items never before associated with the plant - from shampoo and insect repellent, to socks, gloves, and even roasted peanuts. This reinvention of how bamboo is used has made it possible for the small family businesses which make up the industry to stay alive and to start reversing the decades of decline. At the height of bamboo production in Taiwan in the 1970s, more than 13 million stalks were harvested each year, and sales of the stalks alone - not including the finished products - amounted to $3.5m (\u00a32.1m) per annum. Plastic is very cheap and can be used for longer,  but what a shame, bamboo is more environmentally friendly\u201d But in the past decade, the annual harvest amounted to only about 1.67 million stalks with sales adding up to just $456,000 - a little over 10% of the peak level. Production and sales, however, have been steadily climbing in recent years.  Following a devastating earthquake on 21 September 1999 centred in Nantou county, where Zhushan lies, the central government decided to help the local economy by commissioning the country's non-profit Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to find new ways to help the bamboo industry grow. ITRI developed a method to carbonise bamboo stalks to produce high quality bamboo charcoal, which has a multitude of different uses. Naturally insulating, the charcoal can be turned into fibres and woven into fabric to make hats, scarves, gloves, socks and pants. Also said to be health giving, it is increasingly added to bodycare products, such as skin creams. Meanwhile, in industry it is used to purify water and air. Yet its most unusual application has to be in the production of bamboo charcoal-coated peanuts - which look exactly as they sound - peanuts covered with charcoal. Many people who have never tasted them are queasy about giving them a try, but they actually taste good, not at all like charcoal, and are believed to have health benefits. Such diversification has bought new hope to Taiwan's bamboo industry. \"When I was growing up, the toys we played with were made of bamboo,\" says Chen Ching-fu, general manager of the Bamboo Culture Park in Zhushan - a manufacturer of bamboo product, and the first visitor attraction in Taiwan devoted to the plant. \"Bamboo was all around us, but never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different types of products.\" Like other businesses, Mr Chen's now sells not only traditional bamboo furniture, but other products such as air fresheners and clothing. Besides bamboo charcoal, the Taiwanese have also found ways to use the actual bamboo to make a much wider variety of products than their ancestors did, including floor panels, pens, clothes hangers and even laptop casings. Sales of goods made from all forms of bamboo in Taiwan now reach $100m, with exports increasing alongside domestic sales. One of the trends helping to drive the revival of the industry is the return of second or third generation young people to help run family businesses. Lin Li-wei, 36, worked at a post office in the capital Taipei after graduating from college. But, making only about $600 a month, he came back to assist his father, who made bamboo ear diggers used by Chinese and Japanese people to remove earwax. He's now put a new spin on the family business - making modern looking clocks, lamps and wall lights out of bamboo. He has been receiving orders for his creations. \"My father supports me trying to innovate,\" says Mr Lin. \"Only through innovations can we add value to our products and continue our business.\" Now he and his father make $5,000 a month. Many of the manufacturers in Zhushan are breaking even, but not making big profits. Still, they persevere, seeing it as their mission to continue to promote the use of bamboo. Bamboo grows fast - just five years to reach maturity, making it one of the most environmentally-friendly plants to use. So growers and industry leaders hope they can replace the use of many types of other wood, and plastic. \"Plastic is very cheap and can be used for a longer time, but what a shame. Bamboo is more environmentally friendly, no chemicals are used to make bamboo products, and the trees grow without the need for fertiliser or pesticides,\" said the Forestry Bureau's Mr Yang. \"Bamboo can also absorb a lot of carbon dioxide and can reduce greenhouse gases.\" Back at the Bamboo Culture Park, Mr Chen has created a do-it-yourself workshop where schoolchildren and other tourists can learn how bamboo charcoal is made and make their own bamboo products. \"Taiwan can't be without bamboo because it's a material we've relied on for generations,\" says Mr Chen. \"I want to help people understand the importance and benefits of using bamboo.\" To hear Cindy Sui's radio version of her look at Taiwan's bamboo industry, check out  ",

He is remarkably friendly and engaging, and is happiest when he is on stage acting in plays such as George Orwell's Animal Farm.  As a child, his caring nature led him to take to the bedside of a victim of the Hillsborough disaster, with such compassion and diligence he was given an award by former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  Chris is great to take to parties... but he is too trusting\u201d But he is unable to go out alone - once, when he did, his openness towards strangers and difficulty in understanding when he is in danger meant he lent his phone to a stranger, who stole it.  He has severe anxiety, and needs constant reassurance from the people around him.   Chris has Williams Syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder affecting around one in 18,000 people in Britain. It has often been dubbed the 'opposite of autism'.  People with WS are empathetic, social, friendly and endearing but they tend to have a low IQ, making tasks such as counting money difficult.  They can feel anxious over stimuli such as the buzzing of a bee, or the texture of food.  The need for reassurance in some cases can leave children of loving households calling 999 and feigning an emergency, as they crave adult attention so much. WS, first identified in 1961, can also cause heart problems, developmental delays, and learning disabilities.  For the psychological side of the disorder, acting can play to the strengths of people with WS. Chris says: \"I am good at reeling people in and being a character in different things.\" He acts with a charity called Mind the Gap, based in Bradford, near his home town of Bingley in West Yorkshire, and cites the time he was a pirate in a play called Treasure Island as amongst his favourites.  When he was a child, and visiting his father in hospital, Chris met  when he was crushed in the Hillsborough stadium disaster in 1989.  Chris befriended Tony, and stayed, loyally, by his bedside for weeks. \"Chris can talk to anyone and doesn't need a response,\" his mother Judy says.  It can be difficult when you see the surge of funding for the tidal wave of autism\u201d Judy says he is also \"great to take to parties\" as he happily introduces himself to new people.  But there is a flip side of this social ease. Judy says Chris is \"too trusting\", and has been taken advantage of.  She said he also needs people around him to be happy and guide him in what opinions he should have.  People with WS may make prolonged eye-contact, and be over-engaging, which can put them in danger. There are also further aspects of the disorder which can land them in hot water.  Lizzie Hurst, chief executive at the Williams Syndrome Foundation, says: \"People [with the disorder] conduct themselves in a way that makes them extremely vulnerable.  \"They don't have the cognitive ability to match their linguistic age. \"There is a classic autistic profile to which Williams Syndrome is the polar opposite. People can gauge the mood of a crowd and adopt without understanding the nuances of the situation.\" Ms Hurst says there were \"questions to be raised\" over whether people with WS could be legally responsible for themselves. \"I would say they cannot,\" she adds.  She is working to raise the profile of the disorder amongst GPs, as she says only one in 40 GPs will encounter the disorder and babies with WS can be difficult to identify.  Facial features in young children include a small, upturned nose, long upper lip, wide mouth, full lips, small chin and a white lacy pattern on the eye's iris.   Anxiety can be made worse if the disorder is not diagnosed, she said, as people feel even more isolated. Ms Hurst's charity does not get any funding from the government, relying on fundraising and donations. She puts on barbecues, Christmas parties and holidays for people with WS and their families.  \"I think the government should do more,\" she says. \"It can be difficult when you see the surge of funding for the tidal wave of autism.  \"WS people are just as needing as other people with mental disorders and in many ways they are more needing of support and attention, and that all comes at a price.\"  People with WS do not have a lower life expectancy than other people, and some may go on to get jobs, most often in a voluntary capacity, where their helpful nature can be useful.  Dr Debbie Riby, senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Durham University, has been working on the disorder for 12 years.  Anybody can have a child with Williams Syndrome\u201d She says WS occurs when part of chromosome seven is deleted, which happens sporadically.  \"Anybody can have a child with Williams Syndrome,\" she says.  Dr Riby says there is no pre-natal screening, but often doctors can pick up clues if a young child has heart murmurs, and problems putting on weight. She has been running parent focus groups to understand the anxiety side of WS to come up with practical steps families can take to help themselves keep their children calm and happy.  Dr Riby says: \"The work around Williams Syndrome used to focus on the theoretical side. I wanted to focus on the practical side. There is still an awful lot that we can do.  \"The most important thing is for us to think about how we can use research to support families.\"   ",

Rebecca Morelle reports for Newsnight on the dark matter experiment that is located in the bottom of a gold mine The quest to find the most mysterious particles in the Universe is entering a critical phase, scientists say.  An experiment located in the bottom of a gold mine in South Dakota, US, could offer the best chance yet of detecting dark matter. Scientists believe this substance makes up more than a quarter of the cosmos, yet no-one has ever seen it directly. Early results from this detector, which  , confirmed it was the most powerful experiment of its kind. In the coming weeks, it will begin a 300-day-long run that could provide the first direct evidence of these enigmatic particles.  We've moved into the 21st Century, and we still do not know what most of the matter in the Universe is made of\u201d Beneath the snow-covered Black Hills of South Dakota, a cage rattles and creaks as it begins to descend into the darkness. For more than 100 years, this was the daily commute for the Homestake miners searching for gold buried deep in the rocks. Today, the subterranean caverns and tunnels have been transformed into a .   Scientists now make the 1.5km (1-mile) journey underground in an attempt to solve one of the biggest mysteries in science. \"We've moved into the 21st Century, and we still do not know what most of the matter in the Universe is made of,\" says Prof Rick Gaitskell, from Brown University in Rhode Island, one of the principle investigators on Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment. Scientists believe all of the matter we can see - planets, stars, dust and so on - only makes up a tiny fraction of what is actually out there.    They say about 85% of the matter in the Universe is actually dark matter, so called because it cannot be seen directly and nobody really knows what it is.   This has not stopped physicists coming up with ideas though. And the most widely supported theory is that dark matter takes the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs.  Prof Gaitskell explains: \"If one considers the Big Bang, 14bn years ago, the Universe was very much hotter than it is today and created an enormous number of particles.  \"The hypothesis we are working with at the moment is that a WIMP was the relic left-over from the Big Bang, and in fact dominates over the regular material you and I are made of.\" The presence of dark matter was first inferred because of its effect on galaxies like our own. As these celestial systems rotate around their dense centre, all of the regular matter that they contain does not have enough mass to account for the gravity needed to hold everything together.  Really, a spinning galaxy should fly apart.  We've worked extremely hard to make this the quietest verified place in the world\u201d Instead, scientists believe that dark matter provides the extra mass, and therefore gravity, needed to hold a galaxy together. It is so pervasive throughout the Universe that researchers believe a vast number of WIMPs are streaming through the Earth every single second. Almost all pass through without a trace.  However, on very rare occasions, it is thought that dark matter particles do bump into regular matter - and it is this weak interaction that scientists are hoping to see. The LUX detector is one of a number of physics experiments based in the Sanford Underground Research Facility that require a \"cosmic quietness\".  Prof Gaitskell says: \"The purpose of the mile of rock above is to deal with cosmic rays. These are high-energy particles generated from outside our Solar System and also by the Sun itself, and these are very penetrating.  \"If we don't put a mile of rock between us and space, we wouldn't be able to do this experiment.\" Inside a cavern in the mine, the detector is situated inside a stainless steel tank that is two storeys high.  This is filled with about 300,000 litres (70,000 gallons) of ultra-purified water, which means it is free from traces of naturally occurring radioactive elements that could also interfere with the results. \"With LUX, we've worked extremely hard to make this the quietest verified place in the world,\" says Prof Gaitskell. It is very competitive\u201d At the detector's heart is 370kg (815lb) of liquid xenon. This element has the unusual, but very useful, property of throwing out a flash of light when particles bump into it. And detecting a series of these bright sparks could mean that dark matter has been found. The LUX detector was first turned on last year for a 90-day test run. No dark matter was seen, but the results concluded that it was the most sensitive experiment of its kind. Now, when the experiment is run for 300 days, Prof Gaitskell says these interactions might be detected once a month or every few months.  The team would have to see a significant number of interactions -  between five and 10 - to suggest that dark matter has really been glimpsed. The more that are seen, the more statistical confidence there will be. However, LUX is not the only experiment setting its sights on dark matter.  With the Large Hadron Collider, scientists are attempting to create dark matter as they smash particles together, and in space, telescopes are searching for the debris left behind as dark matter particles crash into each other. Showing that there was no dark matter would be more of an more interesting result than if there was\u201d Mike Headley, director of the South Dakota Science and Technology Authority, which runs the Sanford laboratory, says a Nobel prize will very probably be in store for the scientists who first detect dark matter.  He says: \"There are a handful of experiments located at different underground laboratories around the world that want to be the first ones to stand up and say 'we have discovered it', and so it is very competitive.\" Finding dark matter would transform our understanding of the Universe, and usher in a new era in fundamental physics. However, there is also a chance that it might not be spotted - and the theory of dark matter is wrong. Dr Jim Dobson, based at the UK's University of Edinburgh and affiliated with University College London, says: \"We are going into unknown territory. We really don't know what we're going to find. \"If we search with this experiment and then the next experiment, LUX Zeppelin, which is this much, much bigger version of LUX - if we didn't find anything then there would be a good chance it didn't exist. He adds: \"In some ways, showing that there was no dark matter would be a more interesting result than if there was. But, personally, I would rather we found some.\" Prof Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist from Durham University, says that many scientists have gambled decades of research on finding dark matter. He adds: \"If I was a betting man, I think LUX is the frontrunner. It has the sensitivity we need.  Now, we just need the data. \"If they don't [find it], it means the dark matter is not what we think it is. It would mean I have wasted my whole scientific career - everything I have done is based on the hypothesis that the Universe is made of dark matter. It would mean we had better look for something else.\" Follow Rebecca  ",

        "article": "The search for MH370 has illustrated once again just how poor are our maps of the ocean floor.  Scientists aren't joking when they say we know better the shape of Mars than we know the hard surface of the Earth.  The oceans are vast and only a small fraction of the seafloor has so far been described in detail.  Look at the map at the top of this page. It shows the topography of the Indian Ocean bottom, west of Australia.  The star marks the rough location where the   has been working this week,   that could be the black boxes of MH370.  It's on the northern edge of a small oceanic plateau, sometimes called Wallaby Plateau or Zenith Plateau.  The geological interpretation of this region is that it incorporates scraps of continental crust that got stranded when India broke off from Australia about 120 million years ago. As a result, the topography is unusually rugged. Some of the shallows can be less than 200m below the surface, but the deep troughs on this map can exceed 7,600m.  If MH370's last resting place really is to be found here somewhere, the recovery of the wreckage could be a very extreme endeavour, indeed. But look again at the map, at the black lines that criss-cross back and forth.   The thick bands indicate tracks surveyed by modern acoustic echosounders, which map a swath of area along the path of the ship, and these are very accurate (to about 2%).  The thin tracks indicate older, low-tech echosoundings, which are not as reliable.  They are, though, \"direct\" measurements.  That cannot be said for everything else you see.   that infer the shape of the ocean bottom from the shape of the water surface above.  Water follows the gravity, and it's pulled into highs above the mass of tall underwater mountains, or seamounts, and slumps into depressions over deep troughs.  This kind of fuzzy mapping is pursued by satellites fitted with radar altimeters. Most of our maps of the gross outlines of mountains on the seafloor were produced this way - thanks to a 1985-86 US Navy satellite campaign and a 1994-95 European Space Agency effort. Fuzzy mapping is a good phrase. The best resolution is about 20km. It's thought there are somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 seamounts that rise a kilometre or more above the seafloor, but which are invisible in these kinds of maps. One estimate suggested it would take a ship, fitted with a modern swath-mapping echosounder system, about 200 years to map the entire ocean floor in high resolution.  Put that another way: it would take 20 dedicated ships 10 years to do the same task. This could be achieved for about $3bn. It sounds a lot of money, but it's the kind of investment we make when we go to Saturn or Jupiter with a big orbiting spacecraft to map those planets and their moons.  And here are some good reasons to do a better job back on Earth.  Not knowing the locations of all the seamounts is a hazard, as the nuclear submarine USS San Francisco found out when  .  But good maps are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it's around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.  Furthermore, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is just the kind of information you need to improve the models that forecast future climate change. Remember: the oceans play an absolutely critical role in the climate system. Governments, however, do not look like they'll commit the necessary $3bn anytime soon - which leaves us with the satellites.  And the latest space technologies could be making a four or five times' improvement on the fuzzy maps.  The problem is you really need not only the right kind of instrument on a satellite, but for that spacecraft to fly in the right kind of orbit around the Earth. And such missions are few and far between, and they often have other priorities.  Consider the  , the first of which was launched last week.   will go up next year with an altimeter that is certainly fit for the task, but it'll be flying repeat, overlapping paths around the globe.  Not ideal.   One of the best bets at the moment is  . Again, the right kind of altimeter, and it's even in the right kind of orbit to sweep the ocean floor in a methodical way. But its primary mission is to measure the   over the Arctic Ocean and the   over Greenland and Antarctica.  Nonetheless, the European Space Agency   to seek improvements in ocean-floor maps in selected places.   The best solution would be to fly a dedicated mission. Estimates say this could be done for as little as about $100m - to get substantially better maps than the ones now being used in the MH370 search, and across the rest of the world. ",

        "article": "The amount of carbon lost from tropical forests is being significantly underestimated, a new study reports. In addition to loss of trees, the degradation of tropical forests by selective logging and fires causes large amounts of \"hidden\" emissions.  The slow moving process has remained almost invisible to satellite observations in the Amazon.  Researchers say degradation in Brazil causes additional emissions equivalent to 40% of those from deforestation. The research is due to be published in the journal Global Change Biology. Chunks of the forest are affected but when you look from the satellite image you still see trees\u201d The rapid removal of trees in the Amazon rainforest has been a significant source of global carbon emissions for many decades.  It is said to account for around 12% of human induced greenhouse gases, roughly the equivalent of both agriculture and transport. But the estimates of these losses have relied mainly on satellite observations to count the missing trees.  Scientists have long been aware that the human impact on the rainforest is a slow process and that carbon is being lost even though the satellites show the tree cover is still intact. The researchers compared four different types of forest to accurately assess the scale of emissions. They looked at undisturbed sites, selectively logged sites, forests that had been logged and burned and sites that had once been turned into pasture and were now returning to forest. \"With the loss of the big trees from selective logging and fire, you see them being substituted by loads and loads of small diameter trees and lianas - that make a highly dense understory,\" said Dr Berenguer. This new study attempts to overcome these limitations by using on-the-ground assessments. Over 70,000 trees were measured and over 5,000 soil samples were taken in an effort to get an accurate picture of the impact of degradation. \"It's been completely overlooked,\" said lead author Dr Erika Berenguer from Lancaster University.  \"When we talk about deforestation, we completely remove the forest and all that carbon is lost.\" \"When you talk about degradation it is more cryptic. Chunks of the forest are affected but when you look from the satellite image you still see trees, you just don't know the condition, and that is why it is overlooked.\" Degradation is slow moving and the researchers acknowledge it is hard to measure. They believe that this is one of the reasons that it has been underestimated.  Another factor is that in Brazil much of the degraded forest is in private hands, meaning that researchers have to work with a large numbers of landowners to assess the losses.  The team believe their study is the most accurate picture yet of the scale of emissions from this source. They believe that in 2010 this amounted to 54 billion tonnes, around 40% of the carbon loss from deforestation in the Amazon.  \"It is mainly fires that escape from burning pasture, selective logging and edge effects,\" said Dr Berenguer. \"These edge effects happen when you fragment a forest, when it is close to a pasture, that border is subject to higher temperatures, higher winds and the forest starts dying out from the edge toward the core.\" The scientists believe that degradation is having an impact on global emissions of carbon as forests in Indonesia and Africa are all subject to similar processes. Existing efforts to tackle the problem they say, are simply not effective.  \"The take-home message from this report for me is the need for better management of tropical lands, with strict controls on selective logging to avoid unnecessary damage to the forest,\" said Dr Simon Lewis, a forest scientist at University College London, who wasn't involved with the study.   Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation plus pro-forest activities (REDD+) has been a key part of global climate negotiations for over a decade.  Delegates have been trying to find a way to pay countries to reduce emissions from forests but the process has struggled to find robust methods for verifying the actions taken to curb deforestation.  Last November in Warsaw,   that many observers believe will be key to preserving forest carbon.  \"This needs to be joined together with fire management, to avoid fires getting near tropical forests.\" Monitoring for degradation has been attempted in Brazil in the past but was discontinued after a number of years. The researchers believe that it is crucial not only to increase the accuracy of carbon counts but to ensure that future attempts to limit activities that encourage degradation are enforced.  But Dr Berenguer believes that researchers and consumers have a role to play as well. \"I would like to see the scientific community paying more attention to it, it is difficult work but we can't overlook it anymore.  \"I would urge the general public to pay attention to their shopping, they can lead to these high levels of emissions by buying uncertified timber.\"  Follow Matt  .

Roger Harrabin reports: ''It is the sea that is going to heat this house'' One of the finest old mansions in Wales is making history with a new technology that sucks heat from sea water. Plas Newydd, with spectacular views of Snowdon from Anglesey, will in future have its collection of past military uniforms warmed by a heat pump. It's the biggest UK scheme of its kind and shows a way in which buildings can be heated without imported gas or oil. It relies on a heat exchanger, which uses a system akin to refrigeration to amplify warmth from pipes in the sea. The 300kW marine source heat pump cost the National Trust \u00a3600,000 and is expected to save around \u00a340,000 a year in operating costs. The proceeds will be returned to the conservation of the 18th century mansion, which boasts relics from the Battle of Waterloo and a spectacular mural by Rex Whistler. Heat pumps are likely to become more common as the UK attempts to decarbonise its heating systems, which (unlike electricity) are almost totally dependent on fossil fuels. The pumps use a compressor and a heat exchanger to suck heat from the air, the ground, or - in this case - water. The system uses electricity to work the exchanger and the pump, and is only efficient if the final heat is usable at a relatively low temperature.  At Plas Newydd it will reach just 55C, but this is perfect for keeping the building at a steady warmth for conservation. Adam Ellis-Jones, from the National Trust, said: \"With the Irish Sea right on the doorstep, a marine source heat pump is the best option for us. \"Being a pioneer is never easy. There are very few marine source heat pumps and none of this size in the UK, so it has been a challenging project - but a very exciting one.\"  was previously the National Trust's most polluting property, warmed entirely by an oil-fired boiler. The use of heat pumps is growing as the government looks to subsidise low-carbon heat sources, but they are by no means universally suitable. Currently they only pay back under certain circumstances - for instance if a property like Plas Newydd  is not connected to the gas grid and relies on expensive oil heating; or if it has been designed to be high-efficiency so it only needs low-grade heat; or if it generates its own electricity through renewables so the power to run the heat exchanger is virtually free.  Air source heat pumps, which suck in air from outside, are the cheapest type to install, but they are the least efficient on the coldest days. Then it is better to have a ground or water source heat pump, with pipes buried underground or underwater, because water and ground will be warmer than air. Homes with under-floor heating are better suited to heat pumps because they require large amounts of warm water at a relatively low heat. Tobi Kellner co-wrote the   for the Centre for Alternative Technology at Machynlleth in mid Wales. He told BBC News that if the UK sticks to its aim to cut CO2 emissions 80% by 2050, heat pumps will be essential.  \"Today heat pumps are not the 'green' heat source of choice for most households because of the polluting nature of our power stations,\" he said. \"In a future where most electricity is produced from renewables this picture would change fundamentally as heat pumps deliver most of the energy required for heating homes.  \"Heat pumps could also play an important role in balancing supply and demand in future energy systems. Electricity is difficult to store, but heat can be stored easily in the form of hot water.\"  He calculates that running heat pumps when wind power output is high and demand low - on, say, a windy night - then storing heat in hot water cylinders or storage caverns could help solve the problems of variable output from renewables. The National Trust is pressing ahead with low-carbon developments across its huge estate. Its managers are uncomfortably aware that these improvements are heavily subsidised by a levy on the bills of all energy users, including the poorest. If its remaining five renewables pilots succeed, the Trust will invest in 43 further renewables schemes.  showing the rivers in England that have the highest potential for water source heat pumps.

        "article": "Changes to UK urban areas provide habitats for mosquitoes, including species known to spread malaria and West Nile virus, a study suggests. Warmer ambient temperatures and more water containers in gardens are bringing mosquitoes into closer contact with people, say scientists. UK mosquitoes are human disease-free but the team says more of the insects breeding in urban areas increases the chances of a potential outbreak. The  . Co-author Amanda Callaghan, an associate professor at the University of Reading's School of Biological Sciences, explained that the study aimed to collect data to see if there was a difference in abundance and diversity of mosquitoes in rural and urban locations. \"We knew that there was an urban heat island effect, and changes in temperature have been known to cause changes in mosquito behaviour and - in some regions, such as southern Europe - diseases have crept into these countries because mosquitoes have changed their behaviour,\" she said.  Writing in their paper, Dr Callaghan and colleague Susannah Townroe observed: \"Within the UK, [water butts - a container for rainwater] are becoming increasingly common in residential gardens. \"A severe drought and subsequent hosepipe ban in the spring of 2012 across southern and eastern England led to reports of hugely inflated sales of water butt containers,\" they added. \"Water butts collect rain from roof guttering along with vegetation, animal detritus... providing both a habitat and food resource for mosquito larvae.\" They explained that while individual containers were relatively small, when all the water butts in the area were combined, it represented a \"large area of habitat\" for breeding mosquitoes. The authors added: \"This, in combination with the [urban heat island] effect... may favour mosquito larval production in urban habitats.\" In order to test this idea, the researchers placed water containers in a number of urban and rural residential gardens. \"We found fewer species of mosquitoes in urban environments compared with rural environments, but the species that were there were much more abundant,\" Dr Callaghan told BBC News. \"The one that was most abundant is called  , and in other countries   carry diseases such as West Nile Virus.\" The other species of mosquito that the researchers found in the study's water containers was  , which has been shown to be a \"reasonably good vector of malaria\". Dr Callaghan said: \"The main finding is that these mosquitoes are right next to people's houses and the   mosquito we found is a human-biting species and it can transmit malaria.  \"Therefore, if someone comes back from their holiday with malaria and they get bitten, it could be transmitted to another person - and that is how you get outbreaks.  \"The chances of there being a malaria epidemic in this country at present are relatively low because there has not been secondary malaria here since the 1950s.\" Secondary malaria refers to someone catching malaria from another person who has also been bitten by a mosquito. \"I am not saying we are all going to get diseases because we have vectors here, but it is worth keeping an eye on.\" More than 30 different mosquito species have been recorded in the UK, most of which are resident all year round. \"In rural areas you get more types of mosquito - there are lots of different types of habitats and different species of mosquito like different types of habitat - some of them will favour ditches, others will favour ponds or tree holes etc,\" Dr Callaghan explained. \"Whereas if you go into an urban environment, you do not have a lot of those habitats so you get a different picture of what species can survive in this environment. \"The   is a well-known urban mosquito, but the   is normally considered to be a tree-dwelling species. But it is changing its habitats from breeding in tree-holes to breeding in man-made water containers. \"This is concerning considering that it is a vector of malaria.\" Dr Callaghan said there were thousands of cases of malaria in the UK each year, mostly as a result of people returning from areas of the world where malaria was present, but people were usually quickly treated. \"If malaria is not in your blood for any length of time, the chances of you being bitten and transmitting it are quite low,\" she said. \"But if more people come back with malaria and there are more mosquitoes that can transmit malaria living by you then that chance increases.\" ",

Animal research into new therapies has failed to deliver after years of experiments, they say. Instead, labs should focus on human-based models such as brain scanning or studies of cells grown from patients. Alzheimer's Research UK said no single approach could provide answers to such a complex disease. Dr Gillian Langley, a scientist and consultant for the animal welfare charity,  , is among a growing body of scientists who believe current research relies too much on animal models. \"Medical research is at a tipping point,\" she told BBC News. The exciting thing about this technology is that you can take cells from patients with a disease and then try to create a model of this disease in a dish\u201d \"There is a growing realisation that animal studies are not producing the breakthroughs we're hoping for.\" Writing in the journal   she said it was time to consider a new paradigm in medical research for Alzheimer's disease. Research was \"lagging behind\" areas such as toxicology, which is using research based on molecular disease pathways within cells and new tools such as genomics, she said. \"We need this overarching view - a new framework so we can use these 21st Century tools.\"  Other scientists say human-based methods of research - once regarded as experimental - are already yielding results.  of Aston University carries out brain imaging to try to develop methods for early diagnosis of dementia in patients. \"We're supportive of initiatives to move forward the human model for good scientific reasons,\" he said. \"In Alzheimer's, at the cellular level, many animal models are valuable. When we move up the model of complexity, there's a point at which the animal model becomes less valid.\" He said researchers such as Dr Eric Hill at Aston University are working on stem cells (the master cells of the human body) to model Alzheimer's disease, which may eventually provide more robust ways of testing treatments. \"These cells were once skin cells that have been reprogrammed to become stem cells again,\" said Dr Hill.   \"They were then differentiated to become neurons and astrocytes.   \"The exciting thing about this technology is that you can take cells from patients with a disease and then try to create a model of this disease in a dish. \" However, the charity,  , said no single approach could address such a complex disease, with animal models, brain studies and new approaches involving stem cells all playing a role. \"Alzheimer's is a complex disease and the brain is a complex organ,\" said head of research Simon Ridley.  \"I think modelling that in a cell culture or in a dish, it's a huge challenge. \"So I think it's very important that we keep a broad perspective on the different types of research, really to try to answer specific questions.\" Dr Laurie Butler, of the University of Reading, added: \"With the number of those affected by dementia set to triple over the next 30 years it's vital we examine all research approaches if the UK is going to fulfil Jeremy Hunt's promise of transforming the country into a 'global leader' in fighting dementia. \" ",

The Energy and Climate Change Committee says nearby nations could capture the emissions from their power stations, then transport the CO2 offshore in pipes. North Sea rocks that have been sucked dry of oil and gas could be pumped full of the unwanted CO2. Critics say the idea is fanciful. But Tim Yeo, the committee's chair, told the BBC that \"the key to carbon capture and storage is economics\".  \"The UK's geology under the North Sea is a potential asset to exploit and if we can find ways of getting another income stream by accepting someone else's unwanted CO2 it might move forward the date when CCS (carbon capture and storage) in the UK is commercially viable,\" he added. Mr Yeo also hopes that by forcing CO2 into the crevices containing residual trapped hydrocarbons, the UK will be able to squeeze more gas and oil from depleted reserves. Overall, his committee is highly critical of the UK government's commitment to CCS. It believes a new industry could be created to transport and store unwanted CO2.  \"Any decline in North Sea (extraction) activity could be compensated for in carbon transport and storage activity,\" it says. The idea is being promoted by the Crown Estate, which governs the UK's sea bed.  But Nick Molho from WWF told the BBC: \"We were very surprised to see this idea - and surprised to see it is thought that the North Sea has enough capacity for all the CO2 we need to dispose of.  \"It seems to be running ahead of itself - let's get the first steps in carbon capture and storage sorted out first.\"  In 2007 ministers launched a competition to kick-start CCS.  To date, it has delivered only initial funding to two projects - a gas plant at Peterhead in north-east Scotland and a coal plant, Drax, in North Yorkshire. The expected start date of CCS has been pushed back from 2014 to 2020.  The MPs say the delay has called into question the credibility of government policy.  Mr Yeo said: \"Fitting power stations with technology to capture and store carbon is absolutely vital if we are to avoid dangerously destabilizing the climate.  \"These two demonstration projects will not be enough to kick-start the CCS industry or have a significant impact on our carbon budgets,\" The world's first full-scale power plant with full CCS is due to open soon in the US - the CO2 will be used to enhance oil recovery.  The technology has been progressing slowly worldwide, with  . WWF said the government should not plan new fossil fuel power plants under the assumption that CCS would become economically viable.   But Energy Minister Michael Fallon said: the UK was ahead of the rest of Europe with the Drax and Peterhead CCS projects, which were \"actively undertaking detailed engineering studies ahead of full construction\".  He said that as the \u00a31bn being invested in CCS, there would \"also be additional support through low-carbon Contracts for Difference for a number of years to come, so it's important we take the time to get our decisions right and follow a robust process\", Mr Fallon added: \"Our vision for CCS in the UK does not stop at these first projects.  \"We want to see a strong and successful CCS industry able to compete on cost with other low carbon technologies in the 2020s.\" ",

        "article": "A new study finds that if temperatures rise and more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, it will reduce the total amount of water in rivers. It is a surprising observation. One might expect the timing of water flow to change but not the overall volume. But this is precisely what scientists discovered when they examined the histories of 420 catchment basins in the US spanning the period 1948-2001. The researchers report their work in the journal  . The study compares places of similar climate and precipitation, but with differing fractions of that precipitation falling as snow and as rain.  Media requires JavaScript to play. And it seems there is a significant difference in total streamflow if the fraction shifts from snow to rain. \"At first we thought there could be all kinds of explanations for this, so we better dig a bit deeper and make sure that this difference between places wasn't being caused by something else,\" explained Dr Ross Woods from Bristol University, UK.   \"We also checked out what happened at the same place between different years, and we found that the years with more snow also produced more streamflow than the years with less snow,\" he told BBC News. The team is now working through a number of possible explanations.   One idea is that the ground is also changing in response to temperature. Colder conditions will lead to frozen ground, meaning when the snows do melt the water can run direct into streams and rivers. In contrast, with warmer conditions, more water can be held in the ground for longer, to be later evaporated or transpired by plants. Less of the overall volume of water would then make it to streams and rivers. \"This issue is important because quite a lot of the snow at the moment is in the places we call the 'water towers' - the places that provide water to the great bulk of society,\" said Dr Woods. \"If the amount of water in the river on average goes down then those people find themselves under more pressure. Irrigation systems or hydropower systems or municipal water supply systems - the total amount of water available to those systems would be less.   \"Those communities or systems would need then to adapt to that - to find a way to get by with less water, or else find alternative water sources.\" Of course, under a generally warming climate, the overall patterns of precipitation are likely to change as well, with some locations receiving perhaps significantly more or less precipitation, irrespective of the fraction that is falling as snow or as rain. The effect observed in this study may not therefore have too much relevance in some locations if their total water balance is rising. But in other, currently snowy places where overall precipitation is declining as well, the effect could compound problems. The team hopes in future work to tease out the mechanisms involved. Lead author Wouter Berghuijs said: \"Hydrologists can take a large number of measurements at an individual site where they can determine for example what part of the flow in the river is due to a recent precipitation event and what part is due to ground water, by taking isotopic measurements of the stream.   \"So, by going into great detail at individual places, it would be possible to understand the small-scale processes that underlie the behaviour that we observe,\" the researcher from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, told BBC News. The study was also presented at the recent European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria.   and follow me on Twitter:  ",

When these two food groups come together they form nitro fatty acids which lower blood pressure, they told PNAS journal.  The unsaturated fat in olive oil joins forces with the nitrite in the vegetables, the study of mice suggests.  Nuts and avocados along with vegetables should work too, they say. Humans have this same enzyme so we think the same happens in people\u201d Inspired by traditional cuisine of countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy, the Mediterranean diet has long been associated with good health and fit hearts. Typically, it consists of an abundance of vegetables, fresh fruit, wholegrain cereals, olive oil and nuts, as well as poultry and fish, rather than lots of red meat and butter or animal fats.  While each component of the Mediterranean diet has obvious nutritional benefits, researchers have been puzzled about what precisely makes the diet as a whole so healthy. Prof Philip Eaton, from King's College London, and colleagues from the University of California in the US believe it is the fusion of the diet's ingredients that make nitro fatty acids. In their study, part-funded by the British Heart Foundation, the researchers used genetically engineered mice to see what impact nitro fatty acids had on the body. Nitro fatty acids helped lower blood pressure by blocking an enzyme called epoxide hydrolase.  Prof Eaton said: \"Humans have this same enzyme so we think the same happens in people.\" This explains why a Mediterranean diet is healthy, even though it contains fat, he says. \"With the fats in the Med diet, if taken together with nitrates or nitrites, there's a chemical reaction and these combine to form nitro fatty acids. \"It's nature's protective mechanism. If we can tap into this we could make new drugs for treating high blood pressure and preventing heart disease,\" he said.  He said human trials were planned.  Dr Sanjay Thakrar of the British Heart Foundation said: \"This interesting study goes some way to explain why a Mediterranean diet appears to be good for your heart health. The results showed a way in which a particular compound could combat high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease. \"However, more work is necessary as these experiments were conducted in mice and this compound could also be having its effect through other pathways.\" ",

They were able to hold a metal plate a few centimetres above the rabbit's chest and use it to regulate the animal's heartbeat. If such medical implants could be made to work in humans, it could lead to smaller devices that are safer to fit. The findings are published  . The researchers from Stanford University hope their development could also eventually dispense with the bulky batteries and clumsy recharging systems that are currently a feature of such devices. The central discovery was a new type of wireless power transfer that could safely penetrate deep inside the body, using roughly the same power as a cell phone. \"We need to make these devices as small as possible to more easily implant them deep in the body,\" said co-author Dr Ada Poon, from Stanford's department of electrical engineering. There are broadly two categories of electromagnetic wave that have been considered until now: far-field and near-field. Far-field waves, like those broadcast from radio towers, can travel long distances, but either bounce off the body harmlessly, or are absorbed as heat. Near-field waves can be safely used, but they can only transfer power over short distances. The researchers were able to design a device that blends the safety of near-field waves with the reach of far-field waves. \"With this method, we can safely transmit power to tiny implants in organs like the heart or brain, well beyond the range of current near-field systems,\" said John Ho, a graduate student in Dr Poon's lab.

Never before has anyone seen mummy hair, muscles and bone at such fine resolution.  It is enabling scientists for the first time to tell their age of the mummies, what they ate, the diseases they suffered from, and how they died. Each mummy was put into a state-of-the-art CT scanner. Researchers probed them layer by layer to build up a  high-definition 3D picture of each one. Once digitised, British Museum staff were then able to peel away each layer, to see the face of the person underneath the bandages.  John Taylor, who is the museum's curator of Ancient Egypt and Sudan said he was \"stunned\" when he saw the images. \"It's as if you switched a light on in a dark room and things jump out with a clarity where you are able to find out what the life experiences of these people really were,\" he told BBC News. The researchers were able to see muscles and even arteries. They noted some seemed clogged with fatty deposits, suggesting these particular people ate rich food and perhaps suffered and possibly died of coronary heart disease. Peeling away the muscle, researchers were able to see the skeletons in unprecedented detail. They were able to estimate the age of the individuals from their pelvis and their dental structure. Many of them had bad teeth with signs of severe abscesses that must have been very painful on a daily basis. One scan shows a spatula - shown in green - left inside the individual's skull.  The tool was to be used to pull the brain out through the nostrils, but a large chunk of brain - shown in blue - was left inside, along with the tool.  It is evidence perhaps of a slip-shod job that was covered up by the embalming practitioners.  The mummies for this project were selected from the British Museum's collection. They cover a time span of 4,000 years, from 3,500 BC to AD 700. The individuals all lived in the Nile Valley An   of the mummies is on display at the British Museum between 22 May and 30 November.

        "article": "Physicists have uncovered a surprisingly straightforward strategy for turning light into matter. The design,  , adapts technology used in fusion research and can be implemented at existing facilities in the UK. Several locations could now enter a race to convert photons into positrons and electrons for the very first time. This would prove an 80-year-old theory by Breit and Wheeler, who themselves thought physical proof was impossible. Now, according to researchers from Imperial College London, that proof is within reach.  Prof Steven Rose and his PhD student, Oliver Pike, told the BBC it could happen within a year.  \"With a good experimental team, it should be quite doable,\" said Mr Pike. If the experiment comes to fruition, it will be the final piece in a puzzle that began in 1905, when Einstein accounted for the photoelectric effect with his model of light as a particle.  Several other basic interactions between matter and light have been described and subsequently proved by experiment, including Dirac's 1930 proposal that an electron and its antimatter counterpart, a positron, could be annihilated upon collision to produce two photons. Breit and Wheeler's theoretical prediction of the reverse - that two photons could crash together and produce matter (a positron and an electron) - has been difficult to observe. \"The reason this is very hard to see in the lab is that you need to throw an awful lot of photons together - because the probability of any two of them interconverting is very low,\" Prof Rose explained.  His team proposes gathering that vast number of very high-energy photons by firing an intense beam of gamma-rays into a further cloud of photons, created within a tiny, gold-lined cylinder.  That cylinder is called a \"hohlraum\", German for \"hollow space\", because it contains a vacuum, and it is usually used in nuclear fusion research. The cloud of photons inside it is made from extraordinarily intense X-rays and is about as hot as the Sun. Hitting this very dense cloud of photons with the powerful gamma-ray beam raises the probability of collisions that will make matter - and history. \"It's pretty amazing really,\" said Mr Pike. He says it took some time to realise the value of the scheme, which he and two colleagues initially jotted down on scrap paper over several cups of coffee.  \"For the first 12 hours or so, we didn't quite appreciate its magnitude.\"  But their subsequent calculations showed that the design, theoretically at least, has more than enough power to crack the challenge set by Breit and Wheeler in the 1930s. \"All the ingredients are there,\" agrees Sir Peter Knight, an emeritus professor at Imperial College who was not involved in the research but describes it as a \"really clever idea\". \"I think people will seriously start to have a crack at this,\" Prof Knight told BBC News, though he cautioned that there were a lot of things to get right when putting the design into practice.  \"If it's done in a year, then they've done bloody well! I think it might take a bit longer.\" Some healthy scientific competition may speed up the process.  There are at least three facilities with the necessary equipment to test out the new proposal, including the Atomic Weapons Establishment in Aldermaston.  \"The race to carry out and complete the experiment is on,\" said Mr Pike.

They include strong, stiff plastics and flexible gels that can mend themselves if torn. The findings,  , could lead to cheaper and greener cars, planes and electronics. It is the first time that durable \"thermoset\" plastic has been produced in a recyclable form. Dr Jeanette Garcia, from IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, stumbled upon the first new class of thermosets in many years when she accidentally left one of three components out of a reaction.  \"I had this chunk of plastic, and I had to figure out what it was,\" Dr Garcia told the BBC. \"I had to smash my round-bottomed flask with a hammer.\" That chunk of plastic, produced from unexpectedly simple ingredients, proved to be tremendously hard and stable. Crucially, it could be digested in acid, reverting to its original components. This digestion reaction allows the chemical building blocks, or monomers, to be reused. \"It was definitely fortuitous,\" Dr Garcia said. \"The first thing I did, of course, was to hit the literature, to try and see if it'd been done before. I just assumed that it had been - it's such a simple reaction.\"  But her search turned up nothing. This was new. Once she understood what she had created, Dr Garcia set about repeating her finding. \"We wasted a lot of flasks,\" she said.  Because they are strong and light-weight, thermosets are used throughout modern cars and aircraft, often mixed with carbon fibres to form composites. Some 50% of the new Airbus A350 jet, for example, will be made from composites. Yet until now, none of this thermoset plastic could be recycled. \"The potential impact here is phenomenal,\" said Dr Charl Faul, a materials chemist at the University of Bristol. He says the study offers a \"very simple, elegant answer to a very old problem\". Dr James Hedrick, who was in charge of the research at IBM, is excited by the possiblities. When a large or expensive component is damaged or reaches the end of its useful life, he explained, it could be repaired or recycled instead of thrown away.  \"The ability to rework saves a tremendous amount of money and mitigates waste.\" Beyond replacing thermoset-based composites in current technology, Dr Hedrick sees the potential for many more innovative applications. \"We're at the discovery phase,\" he said. \"Every time you discover a new polymer-forming reaction it leads to all sorts of new materials.\" As well as very hard and durable plastics, the researchers adapted their procedure to a different monomer and produced flexible, self-healing gels. These could be useful in anything from cosmetics, to paint, to the design of drug capsules, because of their particular solubility properties.  \"Applications are running like water,\" Dr Hedrick said. \"We don't even know where to go with this yet.\" ",

Rebecca Morelle reports on the inspiration for the competition A \u00a310m prize has been launched to solve one of the greatest scientific problems facing the world today.  The competition idea is based on the 1714 Longitude Prize, which was won by John Harrison. His clocks enabled sailors to pinpoint their position at sea for the first time.  In  , the public will be asked to choose a new challenge.  Six potential categories have been announced, ranging from healthcare to the environment. After a special 50th anniversary edition of the  , the public will be able to cast their vote on the issue that they would most like to see tackled. Geoff Mulgan, chief executive of the charity Nesta, which is looking after the prize, said: \"If you want to solve a scientific problem, one method is to go to top universities and top scientists and ask them to solve it.  \"But over the years, and this was something pioneered by the Longitude Prize in the 18th Century, it's often better to open it up to anyone to come up with a solution.\" The original \u00a320,000 prize was set by the British government to solve the most vexing issue of the 18th Century: how to determine a ship's longitude at sea. For sailors to pinpoint their position on the waves, they required two clocks: one that was set each day, using the the height of the sun in the sky, and another that kept the time back at port. The problem with the latter was that the pitch and roll of the oceans, and the humidity and temperature changes at sea would damage the delicate mechanisms of a timepiece. But Mr Harrison, a clockmaker from Yorkshire, created a chronometer that overcame these problems. It took several prototypes and decades of battling with the scientific elite before he was finally deemed the winner. His work revolutionised navigation and saved countless lives. Now, 300 years later, a new challenge is being launched.  We're going to set a very precise measurement of what will count as eligibility for winning the prize\u201d Nesta and the government-funded Technology Strategy Board are offering \u00a310m for a solution to the biggest scientific problem of our time. The categories from which \"the problem\" will be chosen was announced on Monday. These themes have been been selected by a Longitude Committee, chaired by the English Astronomer Royal, Prof Sir Martin Rees, after widespread consultation with experts across various fields. They are: Standing next to Harrison's H4 timekeeper at the launch of the prize, the BBC's director-general Tony Hall said: \"What's really exciting about the Longitude Prize 300 years on in 2014 is that there might be another modern-day John Harrison somewhere out there - someone who will be inspired to change our world fundamentally, and they may not even know that they're a scientist.\" Comparing the modern prize to its predecessor, Prof Sir Martin Rees, chair of the Longitude Committee and English Astronomer Royal, commented: \"There's no manifest number one problem as there was in the 18th Century. Rather there are many broad societal problems demanding fresh thinking.  \"There's a pressing need also for the UK to channel more brain power into innovation, jump-start new technologies and enthuse young people.\" Each category will be examined in the   to be broadcast on BBC Two at 2100 on Thursday. After that, a public vote will be opened, with a favoured theme to be announced on 25 June. At the prize launch held at Broadcasting House in London, the six challenges were outlined by Horizon presenters.   Media requires JavaScript to play. Prof Brian Cox: Public vote on Longitude Prize is invaluable A&E doctor Saleyha Ahsan is presenting the segment on providing freedom of movement for people with paralysis. She demonstrated the potential for her challenge with the help of Sophie Morgan, who has a spinal cord injury.  Using a robotic exoskeleton called Rex, Ms Morgan was able to stand up on stage.  Ms Morgan, who has been using Rex for one month, told the audience: \"Having been sat down all the time, it is literally and metaphorically a perspective shifter... I've been psychologically affected by talking to people at eye level and there are health benefits. Already, I'm sleeping better, feeling better, my body is getting better and the pain is gone.\" BBC TV presenter Michael Mosley demonstrated his challenge with the help of insects, a source of protein that could offer one way to fight world hunger. He suggested insects could be turned into a kind of flour to make them more palatable to consumers. After the result of the vote is announced, experts will then convene to refine the details of the challenge, with anyone from around the world able to submit their solution. Mr Mulgan said: \"We're going to set a very precise measurement of what will count as eligibility for winning the prize.  \"The prize will only be awarded when someone can demonstrate that their invention actually meets those criteria.\" He said that it could be several years before a winner is decided. David Rowan, the editor of Wired Magazine, is on the committee.  He said: \"The brilliant thing about the Longitude Prize is that we don't know where the answer's going to come from.   \"The crowd is smarter than any of us on the committee.  And the beautiful thing about the internet is that by connecting people together, two plus two is five or five hundred.  People come together in all sorts of extraordinary and unpredictable ways to solve problems and we want to see where this goes. Surprise us!\"  And Roger Highfield, the renowned science writer and director of external affairs at London's Science Museum, commented: \"We've got challenges like global climate change, like the growth in the global population, pressure on food supplies, and pressure on water supplies.  I think actually this is a very opportune moment for challenges across a range of fronts. So, the Longitude Prize has just come in the nick of time.\" Follow Rebecca  ",

        "article": "The news that signals consistent with the missing Malaysia Airlines plane have been detected has been called the most promising lead so far. Experts are still urging caution at this stage, but if these \"pings\" detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield are confirmed a recovery operation could at last get under way.  David Mearns, director of Blue Water Recoveries Ltd, said: \"We've gone from little hope to a lot of hope in the space of a day.  \"They went from this colossal search area to something very small, and that has been the game-changer. And fortunately they got there in time that the two pingers are apparently still working.\" By continuously criss-crossing over the site, they will refine the position and narrow that down even more\u201d The two signals heard by a pinger-locator towed by the Australian ship are being analysed to see if they are consistent with the flight recorders.  They are being prioritised over signals briefly detected by the Chinese search vessel, Haixun 01, over the weekend. The first step will be for Ocean Shield and the British naval vessel HMS Echo to return to the patch of ocean where they were detected, and to listen again before the data recorders' batteries, which are already nearing the end of their life, run down.  Mr Mearns says: \"They'll be working to hear them as long as they possibly can. By continuously criss-crossing over the site, they will refine the position and narrow that down even more. It will give them a  pretty precise position of where the wreckage field is. \"HMS Echo will have a pretty accurate fathometer - an echo sounder - to determine the depth. And that is really important.\" If this location is less than 4,500m beneath the waves, then Ocean Shield has an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) called Bluefin 21 onboard that could be deployed to map the ocean floor. Dr Simon Boxall, an oceanographer from the University of Southampton, says: \"The AUV can use cameras to look at the sea bed, and it has a side-sonar to sweep for wreckage, but you are not getting it live. You have to wait for it to get to the surface to say what it has seen.\" An ROV is tethered to the ship, and that will give you a live feed\u201d If the signal is coming from a deeper spot, a different kind of unmanned vessel would be required. The US Navy and a contractor called Phoenix International have remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) that can dive to depths of up to 6,000m. Dr Boxall says: \"An ROV is tethered to the ship, and that will give you a live feed from the side-scanner sonar and the camera, which means you can focus in on any interesting targets.\" Depending on how the plane hit the water, the wreckage field could be spread over hundreds of metres. A priority would be to locate and recover the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, which could help to answer what happened to the plane, which disappeared on 8 March. However, other wreckage could also prove crucial to the investigation. For example, it could indicate whether a fire or explosion had occurred onboard. \"An ROV has manipulators. If the black boxes are found, it could use them to bring them back to the surface. Anything bigger and you would have to take cables down and lift stuff up gradually,\" says Dr Boxall, It is a process that could take weeks or even months.  The seabed in this part of the ocean is not well mapped, but it contains underwater mountains and crevices that could make the task even more challenging. The sea conditions are also difficult: winter in the southern hemisphere is about to begin, and this is an area prone to cyclones. However, Mr Mearns said while the operation would certainly be complex, it was one that had to happen. \"It makes no difference. They will find the plane. They have the right equipment out there and they will get it,\" he said. Follow Rebecca  ",

Engineers have tried to mimic the roughness of shark skin when designing swim suits and even racing cars. But the denticles have never been so well reproduced before, says a   in the Journal of Experimental Biology.  Perhaps counter-intuitively, creating turbulence near the edge of a moving object can reduce drag. In this way, the denticles act like the dimples on a golf ball. Now, researchers have also seen them alter specific currents that help propel the shark through water.   George Lauder and his colleagues took a detailed scan of a tiny square of skin from a mako shark, and built a 3D model of a single denticle just 0.15mm long.  The challenge was then to manufacture a synthetic skin, with thousands of these denticles embedded in a smooth, flexible membrane.   \"It took us about a year,\" said Prof Lauder, of Harvard University. 3D printing builds up new objects layer-by-layer, following a computer-generated design. To print the shark skin, the scientists had to use two different materials for the hard, tooth-like structures and for the flexible base - much like the different coloured inks used to print a picture.  The particular shape of the denticles also posed difficulties: \"Because they're overhung, the 3D printers have to print a supporting material, which you then have to remove,\" Prof Lauder told the BBC. \"It took a while to work out all the tricks.\" The artificial skin has impressed Oliver Crimmen, a fish expert at the Natural History Museum who has previously advised Speedo on swim suit design.  \"I used to think, how on earth would you mimic that complex structure accurately?\" he said. \"3D printing is it - what a marvellous application for it.\" Because the resolution of even the latest 3D printers is limited, the artificial denticles are about 10 times larger than the real ones seen on the skin of a mako shark.  Nonetheless, when the team stuck the new artificial skin onto a small, flexible paddle and studied it in a water tank, they were able to see the benefit sharks glean from their unusual scales. A paddle with the new, toothy skin delivered a boost of up to 6.6% in swimming speed, compared to one coated with the smooth membrane alone. The artificial denticles also allowed the paddle to travel the same simulated distance while using 5.9% less energy. \"That's a huge effect, when factored over the entire lifetime of an animal that is constantly swimming,\" said Prof Lauder.  Mr Crimmen agrees. \"If you think about it, sharks, which don't have a swim bladder... are on the go most of their lives. Swimming's hard work, especially if you're of any size.\" Interestingly, the advantages were most obvious at relatively slow speeds, when the shark is cruising rather than pouncing. \"It's during the steady, long-distance migrations that you'd really begin to see the benefits,\" Prof Lauder explained. Using a specialised technique to photograph the flow of water, the team also found that the \"leading edge vortex\", a small whirlpool of low pressure generated by the paddle's movement, was stronger with the denticles than without.  Prof Lauder believes this change in water flow could be crucial. \"It can help suck the fish forward,\" he said. \"One of the things that our flow visualisation has suggested is that the structure of the skin may actually increase the thrust - the engine of propulsion - rather than just reducing the drag.\"  Media requires JavaScript to play. When attached to a paddle and studied in a water tank, the artificial skin strengthened the \"leading edge vortex\" created by a swimming motion. Video courtesy of L. Wen, J. Weaver, G. Lauder Researchers have studied the fluid dynamics of moulds and real samples of shark skin before. Prof Lauder is especially pleased with this new, 3D-printed model because it moves and bends, just like sharks. \"You have a rigid scale structure embedded into a flexible membrane, that can then swim.\" Don't expect to be pulling on a denticle-laden swim suit any time soon, however. Transferring this type of design to a textile might take decades, Prof Lauder said. \"But if you could do it, you would see a dramatic effect on swimming performance!\" The idea of copying design elements from biological systems is known as biomimetics.  3D printing technology has made such mimicry a lot easier and, importantly, it allows the designs to be tweaked. For example, Prof Lauder and his team have already begun to play with the spacing, arrangement and shape of the denticles. \"I want to know what causes this effect,\" he said. Aside from that curiosity, Prof Lauder enjoys learning from nature. \"It pays us to understand how the natural world works,\" he told BBC News. \"Millions of years of evolution give us solutions to problems that we may not have thought of.\"  ",

        "article": "Antarctica is now losing about 160 billion tonnes of ice a year to the ocean - twice as much as when the continent was last surveyed. The new assessment comes from Europe's Cryosat spacecraft, which has a radar instrument specifically designed to measure the shape of the ice sheet. The melt loss from the White Continent is sufficient to push up global sea levels by around 0.43mm per year. Scientists report the data in the journal  . The new study incorporates three years of measurements from 2010 to 2013, and updates a synthesis of observations made by other satellites over the period 2005 to 2010. Cryosat has been using its altimeter to trace changes in the height of the ice sheet - as it gains mass through snowfall, and loses mass through melting.  The study authors divide the continent into three sectors - the West Antarctic, the East Antarctic, and the Antarctic Peninsula, which is the long finger of land reaching up to South America. Overall, Cryosat finds all three regions to be losing ice, with the average elevation of the full ice sheet falling annually by almost 2cm.  In the three sectors, this equates to losses of 134 billion tonnes, 3 billion tonnes, and 23 billion tonnes of ice per year, respectively. The East had been gaining ice in the previous study period, boosted by some exceptional snowfall, but it is now seen as broadly static in the new survey. As expected, it is the western ice sheet that dominates the reductions. Scientists have long considered it to be the most vulnerable to melting. It has an area, called the Amundsen Sea Embayment, where six huge glaciers are currently undergoing a rapid retreat - all of them being eroded by the influx of warm ocean waters that scientists say are being drawn towards the continent by stronger winds whipped up by a changing climate. About 90% of the mass loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is going from just these few ice streams. At one of them - Smith Glacier - Crysosat sees the surface lowering by 9m per year. \"CryoSat has given us a new understanding of how Antarctica has changed over the last three years and allowed us to survey almost the entire continent,\" explained lead author Dr Malcolm McMillan from the NERC   at Leeds University, UK.   \"We find that ice losses continue to be most pronounced in West Antarctica, along the fast-flowing ice streams that drain into the Amundsen Sea. In East Antarctica, the ice sheet remained roughly in balance, with no net loss or gain over the three-year period,\" he told BBC News.  on a dedicated quest to measure changes at the poles, and was given a novel radar system for the purpose. It has two antennas slightly offset from each other. This enables the instrument to detect not just the height of the ice sheet but the shape of its slopes and ridges. This makes Cryosat much more sensitive to details at the steep edges of the ice sheet - the locations where thinning is most pronounced. It also allows the satellite to better detect what is going on in the peninsula region of the continent where the climate has warmed rapidly over the past 50 years. \"The peninsula is extremely rugged and previous satellite altimeters have always struggled to see its narrow glaciers.  With Cryosat, we get remarkable coverage - better than anything that's been achieved before,\" said Prof Andy Shepherd, also of Leeds University.    The GRL paper follows   that have made a specific assessment of the future prospects for the Amundsen Sea Embayment.   One of these reports concluded that the area's glaciers were now in an irreversible retreat.   The other paper, considering one of the glaciers in detail, suggested the reversal process could take several hundred years to be completed. A loss of all the ice in the six glaciers would add about 1.2m to global sea level.    This is still a small fraction of the total sea-level potential of Antarctica, which holds   (or 58m of sea-level rise equivalent). But the continent has been largely insulated from some of the warming influences taking place elsewhere in the world and it is important, say scientists, to keep a check on any changes that are occurring, and the speed with which they are happening.   Prof Duncan Wingham proposed the Cryosat mission and is its principal investigator. He told BBC News: \"We lack the capability to predict accurately how the Amundsen ice streams will behave in future.  \"Equally, a continuation or acceleration of their behaviour has serious implications for sea level rise. This makes essential their continued observation, by Cryosat and its successors.\" Prof David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the Cryosat survey, commented: \"The increasing contribution of Antarctica to sea-level rise is a global issue, and we need to use every technique available to understand where and how much ice is being lost.   \"Through some very clever technical improvements, McMillan and his colleagues have produced the best maps of Antarctic ice loss we have ever had. Prediction of the rate of future global sea-level rise must begin with a thorough understanding of current changes in the ice sheets - this study puts us exactly where we need to be.\"  and follow me on Twitter:  ",

        "article": "The number of people in favour of fracking for shale gas in the UK has fallen below 50%, a new poll suggests. Just 49.8% were in favour of shale gas extraction when researchers from the University of Nottingham asked 3,657 people earlier this month. This is the lowest number in support of fracking since the university started its poll on the issue in 2012. The latest results found 31.4% were against fracking, while 18.4% were undecided. \"The May 2014 survey confirms that the turn against fracking for shale gas in the UK has deepened,\" says the report. And it cites the   in West Sussex in 2013 as a tipping point when the tide of public opinion towards shale gas extraction began to shift. Since those protests the number of people against fracking has been steadily rising, it says. BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said this was bad news for the government, given that it wanted to encourage shale gas as an alternative to imported gas from Russia. It's clear from the trend in polling that it's the protests that Balcombe have swung opinion\u201d He said ministers would not be delighted to learn that a second anti-fracking camp was planned for this summer.  Tory peer Lord Howell of Guildford -   because it was \"desolate\" - recently spoke about the issue again, and said the Conservative Party could lose votes by pursuing plans to frack. But the poll, carried out by YouGov on behalf of Nottingham University, suggested that this may not happen as it found support for fracking higher among Tory and UKIP voters - around 68% - while Labour and Lib Dem supporters were generally much less in favour.  The survey also found that an increasing number of people were better educated about the technology and processes behind shale gas extraction. Older people were found to be more accepting of fracking than younger people. The poll found more than 50% of older people approved of the technology, while among those under 25, as many were now against shale gas as were for it. The professor organizing the survey, Sarah O'Hara, said the fall in support from under-55s had been so sharp that at first she did not believe the results. \"This is really surprising,\" she told BBC News.  \"Previously the polls had shown a steady trend towards greater understanding of the technology and greater acceptance, but this has gone into reverse and now support is the lowest overall since we started the poll.  \"It's clear from the trend in polling that it's the protests in Balcombe that have swung opinion.\" According to the survey summary, the prospect of contamination of drinking water had been a \"key issue\" highlighted by protesters.  It said the negative rating for shale gas on water contamination has been maintained and currently stands at -16.6%. The report said trends suggest the \"turn against fracking\" seen after the Balcombe protests last year was not a \"blip\" and represent \"an increasing sense of unease\" with the technology's environmental implications. Fracking is the process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well.  Dr Tina Hunter, Director of the Centre for International Minerals and Energy Law at the University of Queensland, warned a shale conference in London on Monday that rushing ahead with fracking had caused huge social and environmental problems in Australia. She said: \"Don't go into fracking fast. Australia is a big, big country. A lot of it is desert, yet we've still had huge problems there by rushing ahead before legislation and public opinion were ready.\" Dr Hunter applauded the UK government's more cautious approach, and suggested that the UK mandate \"fingerprint\" tests on the water flowing back from the fracking process in any well. Chemical analysis would establish the exact chemical signature of the well and provide evidence in any future case of water pollution. An official from the energy department DECC told BBC News this idea was worth examination.  Ross Gurdin, energy policy adviser for the employers' body the CBI, urged a prudent development of shale gas reserves in the UK.  The CBI did not expect any major drop in gas prices in the short to medium term thanks to shale gas, he said, but was keen to attract new tax revenues to the Exchequer and create new feedstock for chemical manufacturers which had previously relied on feedstock from North Sea gas. An announcement from the British Geological Survey of the reserves under the Weald of the south of England is due soon.  ",

Researchers say the climatic phenomenon, which triggers changes in temperature and rainfall, can reduce maize yields by more than 4%. El Nino episodes are caused by changes in the sea surface temperature in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. , the team said the data could be used by governments to manage food supplies. They wrote: \"Results show that El Nino likely improves the global-mean soybean yield by 2.1-5.4% but appears to change the yields of maize, rice and wheat by -4.3% to 0.8%. \"The global-mean yield of all four crops during La Nina years tend to be below normal (-4.5% to 0.0%),\" they observed. The periodic warming (El Nino) and cooling (La Nina) of sea surface temperature in the eastern Pacific Ocean are phases in the naturally occurring phenomenon El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  Media requires JavaScript to play. What are El Nino and La Nina, and how do they affect weather patterns? These phases cause a shift in the position of the jetstream, which - in turns - alters temperature and rainfall patterns in many regions around the world. These changes result in extreme weather conditions, such as drought or abnormal rainfall, in the affected areas. This has a knock-on effect on crop yields, which are heavily influenced by temperature and precipitation levels. \"This new work tells us that we can predict when the bad years will be, ahead of the harvest,\" explain co-author Prof Andy Challinor from the University of Leeds, UK. The researchers found that the high reliability of ENSO forecasts presented an opportunity to link it with global crop yields data. This, in turn, would be potentially beneficial for food monitoring and famine early warning systems. The team mapped the impact of ENSO on the yields of four major food crops: maize, rice, wheat and soybean. These crops account for almost 60% of the world's food calories produced on croplands. The team observed: \"Our results reveal that ENSO's impacts on the yield vary among geographical locations, crop types, ENSO phase and technology used by the crop-producing regions.   \"Consequently, minimising the negative impacts or maximising the positive impacts of ENSO on global yields are increasingly important not only to ensure short-term food availability but also to maintain positive yield trends.\" The scientists suggested that the forecasts could help mitigate impacts by influencing planting dates, crop choices, as well as considering other inputs such as chemical treatments and irrigation. \"An improved response to ENSO could reduce the risk of malnutrition; allow for an increase in agricultural investment in positively impacted years; and improve the adaptation capability to climate variability and change.\" Earlier this year, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicted a warming of the tropical Pacific, with a majority of models indicating that an \"El Nino may develop around the middle of the year\". This week, data collected by Nasa satellites showed that conditions in the eastern Pacific at the beginning of May 2014 were similar to those experienced in May 1997 - a year that saw one of the powerful El Nino episodes in the 20th Century, which claimed an estimated 2,100 lives and caused US $33bn damage to properties.

These included the possible construction of Dutch-style homes which could float above the rising waters. \"There are some really exciting things that are emerging. There's a rather wonderful technology in Holland where effectively you allow the house to float,\" he told the House magazine. \"It looks just like an ordinary house but all the connections are flexible and in the event that flooding occurs basically the house just lifts with the water. \"That's probably quite an extreme example, but it's that sort of innovative thinking we need to be having more of.\" Lord Smith, who admitted he gets \"very nervous when it starts raining heavily\", praised the \"astonishing\" job done by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson on flood defence.

A new study has reassessed the shape of the great fjords down which glaciers drain to the ocean. It finds them to be far deeper and to stretch further back inland than was recognised in earlier research. Dr Mathieu Morlighem   that this could expose the glaciers to more prolonged erosion by warm seawaters. \"We know that many of these Greenland glaciers are accelerating and that their fronts are retreating because of the action of warmer ocean waters,\" he said.  \"And because we now know these canyons are far longer than we thought, it means the ice forms can retire much further back, before rising on to land where they won't be in contact with the ocean anymore.\" The usual way to map the thickness of glaciers and the position of the underlying rockbed is to make surveys with airborne ice-penetrating radar. But acquiring such data sets is both expensive and difficult.  Even in those locations where radar has been used, the rugged terrain under the ice can often give a very cluttered picture. And in places where melt water sits on top of the glacier, the radar pulse is simply deflected away from the ice body. Consequently, our knowledge of the true shape of the 200-plus drainage channels around the edge of Greenland has been sketchy.  took a different route with their novel \"mass conservation algorithm\". \"For a given region of interest, I know what's coming in (snow fall), what's coming out (surface melt), and where the ice goes (ice motion derived from satellite [measurements]),\" the scientist explained.  \"With these datasets I can calculate the ice thickness everywhere for the region of interest at a horizontal resolution that is comparable to the ice motion data (400m).  \"I use ice-thickness data from airborne radar soundings to constrain the calculation of ice thickness (I want the calculated ice thickness to match the measurements along the flight lines where they were collected). To get the bed topography, I subtract the calculated ice thickness from a high-resolution surface topography dataset.\" The approach reveals a number of previously unknown glacial valleys where the ice is grounded several hundred metres below sea level for many tens of km inland from the Greenland coast. \"Older models predicted that these glaciers would soon retreat on to higher ground and would stabilise, and so the contribution to sea-level rise from the Greenland ice sheet would be limited,\" said Dr Morlighem. \"But the problem is that these models were based on rockbed topography that was not accurate enough.

Claire Marshall tries out the prototype surfing lake Revolutionary engineering is bringing the power of the ocean to the mountains of North Wales. The go-ahead has been given to build the UK's first inland surf lake. The giant wave lagoon, three times the size of a football pitch, will be the first of its kind in the world. The technology to create the consistent perfect wave has taken a decade to develop and could transform the sport of surfing - giving it the potential to be considered as an Olympic event. A prototype has been built near the Spanish city of San Sebastian. An underwater foil operates beneath a pier that runs the length of the lagoon. It works like a snow plough, pushing the water upwards and outwards. Wavegarden engineer Alex Onatibia presses a button and 1.2m (4ft) waves rise up, peel and break in exactly the same spot. One is formed every minute. Mr Onatibia demonstrated the hand-held control panel: \"We have all the parameters we need to control the machinery. You can see the height and shape and speed and the temperature of the water and exactly where the wave is positioned,\" he says. Lloyd Cole is the GB surf team head coach. He spends a few hours surfing the mechanical wave.  \"It's so much fun! So much better than I thought it was going to be. Just the way the wave is formed and the power behind it,\" he tells me. \"It's going to be a game-changer, both from a coaching point of view and a surfing point of view. We're really lucky to have it in the UK. It puts a smile on your face and that's what surfing is all about.\" It was the idea of Wavegarden chief executive Josema Odriozola, who surfs in the Basque Country.  \"Every surfer dreams of having the perfect wave in his backyard. Our ambition was to create a wave that is as good as a really good wave in the ocean,\" he says. In the natural world waves are created by the action of wind moving over the water and are affected by, among other things, tides and the geography of the ocean floor. It is a complicated mix.  \"The computer simulation of fluid dynamics has changed dramatically in the last 5 years,\" says Mr Odriozola.  \"It's hard if you make a mistake of 10cm in the depth of the lagoon. Surfers know with the coming and going of the tide that a wave will disappear. We have to be precise.\" It's not just for experienced surfers. The wave can be made smaller for beginners. Mr Odriozola's sons were both under six years old when they started surfing it. The company bringing the technology to the UK is Surf Snowdonia. Construction has just started on a patch of wasteland near the town of Dolgarrog. An aluminium factory used to stand on the site but was closed down in 2007.  The freshwater lagoon will be 300m long and 110m wide and will generate an estimated 60 waves per hour. A ride of 18 seconds will be possible on the expert wave. Andrew Ainscough is the project director. \"The wave is on tap. You book your hour online, you turn up and you get in. It's awesome,\" he explains. According to managing director Steve Davies, the International Surfing Association believes this facility could help persuade the International Olympic Committee to accept surfing as an Olympic sport.  \"One of the obstacles is that every competitor wants precisely the same conditions as the other competitor, and when you're dealing with the natural world, that's impossible to guarantee. The Wavegarden technology produces a level playing field,\" he says. Andrew Cotton from Devon recently surfed one of the largest recorded waves - around 24m (80ft) - off the coast of Portugal.  \"It's a good way to get people in to surfing. But you're missing out on the ocean. Every wave is different and that's what makes a good surfer, reading waves and reading conditions. Learning about the ocean is the key to surfing. But at the same time you can progress your techniques and manoeuvres much more easily,\" he says. The Snowdonia team looks set to pip another group in Bristol which wants to bring a similar project to the West Country. The Bristol Wave hopes to get planning permission in the next few days. There are other surf wave machines, including ones in Tenerife and Dubai. However they operate in a different manner. According to Lloyd Cole, water is lifted up and dropped and it loses its energy more rapidly. This new technology is mechanical, giving engineers the capability of creating a wave that could last for miles. The Snowdonia site is set to open around Easter 2015 and looks set to be the first of many Wavegardens around the world which could revolutionise the sport of surfing. ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. High altitude balloons and simple technology probe the atmosphere Studying the stratosphere used to be the preserve of expensive missions, but cheap electronics are now allowing amateurs to get involved. They call it HABing (high altitude ballooning), and it is the most fun you can have with a balloon without leaving the safety of the ground.  And it is why two years after discovering this fast-growing pastime, I found myself bumping along a dirty road in a battered pickup truck with two friends, Andrew Ashe and Jerry Sandys.  A Yagi directional radio aerial was held out of one window and a smartphone out of the other as we chased our lovingly built contraption across the stunning countryside of the east African country of Malawi. Fill a standard weather balloon with helium, attach a payload with action cameras and tracking electronics - plus a parachute for the descent - and watch it climb into the stratosphere. That, essentially, is amateur high altitude ballooning. Some are attracted by the technical challenge, but for me it is all about the stunning imagery of our amazing atmosphere, bringing back pictures.  At 30km (18 miles) altitude, over 90% of the atmosphere is below the balloon, nothing but blackness above. Anyone who has been on an aircraft with me knows they will never win the fight for a window seat. As a meteorologist and frankly a weather geek, I always grab the chance to get on personal terms with the clouds.  And clouds do not come more impressive than a 10-mile high tropical cumulonimbus, so when Andrew suggested that we mount a HAB expedition to Malawi  I immediately agreed.  There then followed many months of planning and testing.  In Malawi you cannot just pop down to the nearest electronics store if something breaks. All the hours spent slaving over a hot soldering iron on the kitchen table are wasted if you do not get the payload back.  So my technically-minded co-balloonists Andrew and Jerry came up with a couple of simple but sophisticated tracking devices by bolting together bits of electronics sourced on the internet.  Both use a GPS receiver chip wired in to a micro-computer to work out the position and speed of the balloon.  One unit sends this back to a ground receiver via radio and also acts as a radio beacon when on the ground. The other tracker uses a nifty low-power device called a Rockblock to fire off the data to an Iridium satellite 500 miles above, onward to a UK server and then to our Malawi smartphone.  The final backup is a message written on the outside of the box: \"If you find this, please call\u2026 \" We do have some rudimentary control over the flight path of the balloon.  Increase the amount of gas and the balloon rises faster and bursts sooner. Less gas and you will go higher but stay in the air for longer and so get carried further by the winds.  Plugging these figures into a trajectory app gives the expected flight path and landing area which can easily be 50-100km away.  But with so many variables you can never be sure where you will end up and that is all part of the fun.  Once, we recovered a payload from the middle of a polo club in Gloucestershire and on another occasion commandeered a fishing boat to go searching in the English Channel after a miscalculation brought the package down a mile offshore.  We did not recover the payload, but we learnt a lot about the lives of Dungeness fishermen. The stratosphere lies at an altitude of between roughly 10km and 50km and is one of the least studied parts of our atmosphere, too high for most aircraft to fly and too low for satellites. Until recently, it was only expensive missions with huge balloons like the one used by   in his record-breaking parachute jump that were able to collect scientific data, but thanks to cheap electronics there is now enough capacity in amateur payloads to bring back useful results.  A group of high school students in California have even sent up bacteria to see how they cope with conditions similar to those on Mars. We flew a Geiger counter package in Malawi for a professor at the University of Reading who is studying the influence on clouds of charged particles arriving from space. The GPS record of the track of the balloon was used to derive wind speed and direction to check the accuracy of weather forecast models. We sent this data to a research scientist at Copenhagen University.  Malawi was an amazing experience - the scenery, the culture, the friendly and welcoming nature of the people. But what I take away from all our flights is a sense of the beauty and fragility of that thin layer of gas that surrounds our planet. ",

        "article": "When you think of plastic, what springs to mind? Cheap toys from China? Packaging? Or maybe a plastic bag? Of course you would. But how about a woolly jumper? Or cornflakes? Or an antique oak wardrobe?  Believe it or not, from a chemist's perspective all these things are made of the same class of materials: Polymers. And the distinction between which ones we happen to call \"plastics\" and which ones we don't is fairly arbitrary. Polymers are extremely long repetitive molecules which, in the case of plastics, are primarily made of carbon. \"You take a simple organic molecule and you react it with itself again and again and again,\" explains chemistry professor Andrea Sella of University College London. \"A little bit like a bicycle chain, you attach one link, and you click on the next one and the next one and the next one, almost ad infinitum.\" Polymers are a very broad category. By the 1930s you've got  get Ginger Rogers dancing in a beautiful white laminate interior\u201d As well as plastics, they also include the silicones - based on silicon rather than carbon - used in everything from breast implants to fire retardants. They even include DNA. The polymers' shape is what gives plastics their plasticity, allowing them to be moulded into any shape. The individual strands \"can simply slide past each other\" says Sella. \"Think of cold spaghetti.\" Humans have been using naturally derived plastics for far longer than you may imagine. For example, medieval craftsmen made lantern windows out of translucent slices of animal horn. Horn is made of keratin - a mixed carbon-nitrogen polymer - the same stuff that skin and hair, including wool, is made of. But the history goes back further. A millennium and a half before Christ, the Olmecs in Mexico played with balls made of another natural polymer - rubber. In Elementary Business, BBC World Service's Business Daily goes back to basics and examines key chemical elements  - and asks what they mean for businesses and the global economy. It was not until the 18th Century that the first European, French explorer Charles-Marie de La Condamine, stumbled upon the rubber tree in the Amazon basin. And it was only in the 1840s that the American Charles Goodyear and the British Thomas Hancock took out patents on either side of the Atlantic for \"vulcanised\" rubber - treated with sulphur to make it more durable. Vulcanisation made possible the rubber tyre for the bicycle, and later the motor car (hence the Goodyear tyre company). Thomas Hancock, meanwhile, collaborated with Charles Mackintosh to make water-resistant clothing. But the story of plastics goes back earlier even than the Olmecs, in fact as long as man has been using wood. That's because about half of your average piece of wood is cellulose - a polymer that provides the tough walls of plant cells, and wood its stiffness and durability. It is the long strands of cellulose that are separated by the pulping industry, and that give paper its strength. It was also cellulose that provided the raw material for the next great breakthrough in modern plastics - the material \"Parkesine\", modestly named by the British inventor Alexander Parkes, who put it on display at the 1862 international exhibition in London. Many early examples of Parkesine products - printers' moulds, cutlery handles, buttons, combs -   at London's Science Museum. \"Although he's a fantastic inventor, he's not a brilliant businessman,\" explains curator Dr Susan Mossman. \"So he goes bankrupt.\" It was left to two Americans, the Hyatt brothers, to make a mint from the material - much to Parkes' chagrin. They added camphor, improving the plastic's malleability, and renamed it celluloid in 1870, thus providing what would become the raw material for the film industry. Cars and films are not the only technologies whose birth was facilitated by these early plastics. Electrification was first made possible by rubber, which could be used to insulate electrical switches, while the first submarine cables for telecommunications from 1851 were coated in a protective layer of a cousin of rubber called gutta percha. But the big breakthrough - arguably the birth of the modern plastics era - came in 1907, with the invention of Bakelite by the Belgian-born American Leo Baekeland. It was the first synthetic plastic - the first to be derived not from plants or animals, but from fossil fuels. Baekeland used phenol, an acid derived from coal tar. His work opened the floodgates to   - polystyrene in 1929, polyester in 1930, polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polythene in 1933, nylon in 1935. These brand new materials were considered the very height of glamour. \"By the 1930s you've got synthetic plastics that can be produced in whites and pale luminescent colours,\" says Mossman. \"You get Ginger Rogers dancing in a beautiful white laminate interior.\" But what really drove the industry's growth was the war effort, as plastics were used in everything from military vehicles to radar insulation. Petrochemicals companies built plants to turn crude oil into plastic by the lorryload, with the predictable result that, come the end of the War in 1945, the industry faced a horrendous glut. To keep production running, they were forced to think outside the box - or should that be inside the box? - as they turned their attention to the mass consumer goods market, with new products such as Tupperware, launched in 1948. Andrea Sella offers the example of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) invented in 1941, to show how versatile these cheap new materials could be. Today it is used to make fizzy drinks bottles, because it is strong enough to hold two atmospheres of pressure. He then flourishes a soft winter glove, as well as a sheet of plastic for wrapping flowers. \"It's the same material,\" he says. The only difference is the way in which it has been cast. And that is just one plastic. \"There are literally now hundreds of thousands of different kinds of polymers,\" says Sella.  And their properties can be changed just by tweaking their structure. \"A standard British milk bottle is made of polyethylene, made from a building block C2H4. \"If you add just one carbon, and go to polypropylene, what you have is a much more robust material.\" He takes out a baby's drinking cup and lets it drop to the concrete floor. It bounces cheerfully back. \"This was completely transformative. When they came in, they were replacing things like pewter, which gets dented, and glass and ceramics, which have the terrible problem that they smash.\" Synthetic plastics had the added advantage that they seemingly lasted forever. No organisms had evolved that were capable of digesting these complicated and alien materials. But that advantage is, of course, also a great disadvantage. Plastic might sit in a landfill, or litter a street, for thousands of years without decomposing. More worrying are reports that much of our plastic junk - including gazillions of tiny plastic micro-particles that might have broken off from plastic-based clothes in washing machines - have found their way into our oceans, where they collect in giant   in natural gyres in the ocean currents. There is some evidence that  , exploiting the energy embodied in the polymers' hydrocarbon bonds. But there are surely better solutions - such as plastics designed to decompose.  Polylactic acid (PLA) for example, is derived from corn starch, the same stuff that corn flakes are largely composed of. Starch, like cellulose, is a polysaccharide - a long chain of sugar molecules fused together. PLA can be used to make plastic bags, and fibres for clothing. Meanwhile, cellulose can be turned not only into celluloid, but also the food wrapper cellophane, or the fibre rayon. All of these polymers are compostable. Over months or years, they will be gradually broken down by microbes. Apart from the steady accumulation of plastic junk, there is another looming problem - where we get our plastics from in the first place. Currently, most of them come from oil and gas. But when these finite sources eventually run out, the obvious solution will be to go back to the days of Parkes and Goodyear, and look to biology. \"The market is looking for more bio-derived plastics that are chemically identical to the plastics we use now,\" says Dr Jeremy Tomkinson, a York-based consultant who advises the UK government on bio-fuels and bio-materials. \"The main thrust at the moment is polyethylene.\" Partly this has been driven by brand considerations - Pepsi and Coca Cola competed in recent years to boast the first 100% bioplastic PET bottle (Pepsi won). Normally derived from crude oil, the stuff is now being produced from sugar cane by the Brazilian petrochemicals firm Braskem. It uses vats of yeast that have been genetically modified to turn the sugar into ethanol, which can then be converted by stages into ethylene, polythene and PET. Such bioplastics also help battle climate change, Tomkinson argues, as the sugar cane draws carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, sequestering it into a product that can be recycled like any other - even if it is ultimately burned to generate energy, and the carbon dioxide released back into the atmosphere. But Tomkinson says that in the longer term, the main driver for the bioplastics renaissance will not be eco-friendly altruism, but the profit motive.  The big chemicals companies realise that they need to find alternative feedstocks to replace crude oil, and this is already reflected in their research and development spending. For now, the oil price remains steady. And, thanks to the shale revolution, American gas prices are exceptionally low, turning the US into a major producer of PVC. \"But when oil hits a certain dollar price per barrel, it will become too expensive to use,\" he says. \"That's where industrial bio-technology could really begin to take effect.\" And that's where mankind's brief love affair with synthetic plastics will come to an end.

        "article": "A Canadian firm has courted controversy with its claim to have built a practical quantum computer, a feat thought to be decades away. Now, independent researchers are trying to understand whether it really can tap the strange world of quantum physics. For the modest sum of $15m (\u00a39m), a start-up near Vancouver will sell you a black box the size of a garden shed with its logo emblazoned on the side in white neon.  Not sold yet? What if I told you the contents of the box were around 150 times colder than interstellar space?  You still need some convincing - I get it. How about this: The box contains a machine that can solve some of the thorniest mathematical problems and could revolutionise computing. Much of [the scepticism] has gone away as we've continued to advance our technology so far beyond what anyone else has done\u201d Well, the company's sales pitch has worked on some big names - like  ,  , and defence giant  . The Canadian start-up in question is called   and their monolithic machine is - they claim - nothing less than a real, working quantum computer. But not everyone is convinced. Quantum computing exploits the weird physics that takes hold at tiny (atomic or sub-atomic) scales. Computers that tap the quantum realm could carry out complex calculations much faster than their conventional - or classical - counterparts. While the basic units of information in classical computers are called \"bits\" and are stored as a string of 1s and 0s, their equivalents in a quantum system - qubits - can be both 1s and 0s at the same time.  This phenomenon would enable multiple calculations to be performed simultaneously. But the qubits need to be synchronised using a quantum effect known as entanglement, which Albert Einstein termed \"spooky action at a distance\". Scientists have struggled to entangle more than a handful of qubits, and to maintain them in their quantum state. Lab devices suffer from drop-out, where the qubits lose their ambiguity and become straightforward 1s and 0s. This has ensured that quantum computers remain confined to the lab - proofs of principle capable of solving only elementary problems. Headquartered in the small tech hub of Burnaby, on Canada's west coast, D-Wave has raised upwards of $100m in venture capital from the likes of Amazon founder   and  , the venture capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  \"The original vision of the company was simple: build a commercially useful quantum computer as soon as possible,\" Vern Brownell, D-Wave's chief executive, tells me. \"We just want to provide quantum computing resources to researchers and businesses around the world so they can solve really hard problems, better than they can today.\" So far there's no speedup to explain\u201d So when, in 2007, D-Wave   of a quantum processor called Orion that could solve Sudoku puzzles and search a public database of drugs to find the closest match to a specific molecule - both impressive achievements in this field - it was greeted with deep scepticism. Four years later, the company unveiled the \"first commercially available quantum computer\", a 128-qubit machine called the D-Wave One, and this time its claims weren't so easily dismissed. The announcement coincided with the publication of a study   in Nature, one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed journals in the world.  This tempered some of the criticism, but fell short of winning over vocal sceptics like Scott Aaronson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He thinks the firm's computers show \"pretty good\" evidence for entanglement at a local level, though not necessarily on a large scale. But he sees no evidence that this is helping boost the performance of D-Wave's machines. Prof Aaronson told BBC News: \"The questions about 'the explanation for the speedup' haven't even been activated yet, since so far there's no speedup to explain!\" Mr Brownell comments: \"What I think is really interesting is that scientists and researchers are no longer arguing about whether it works, it's how fast does it work? What's the scalability going to be?\" There are things we take for granted about the world around us. Let go of your smartphone and it will fall to the ground. Pull the handle on a drawer and it will open. These familiar rules can be described by the principles of classical mechanics.  But in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, scientists were beginning to realise that classical physics could not explain certain phenomena seen at very large and very small scales.  This spawned two revolutions: one was relativity and the other quantum mechanics. Early experiments suggested light was a wave, rather than a stream of particles. In quantum theory, light can be both a particle (the photon) and a wave.  One principle central to quantum mechanics is that a particle, such as an electron, can exist in all of its possible states simultaneously - known as superposition. Another important idea is that of entanglement, a phenomenon whereby objects become linked, even if they lie far apart. The company's first commercial machine was followed in 2013 by the D-Wave Two, powered by a 512-qubit chip called Vesuvius. Like its predecessor, this computer is not for conventional use, but was designed for solving optimisation problems, a particular class of mathematical challenge that entails finding the best solution from all the possible solutions. Lockheed is using its D-Wave computer - housed at the University of Southern California - to  . Google's machine, which is shared with Nasa  , is being used for machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence with applications in areas as diverse as voice recognition and detecting credit card fraud. The big name buy-in has generated serious buzz, but sceptics have not been swayed. \"I don't care if the Messiah has come to Earth on a flaming chariot, not to usher in an age of peace but simply to spend $10m on D-Wave's new Vesuvius chip,\" Scott Aaronson  , adding that the considered opinion of an academic expert of his choice \"would mean more to me than 500,000 business deals\". D-Wave was founded in 1999 as a University of British Columbia spin-out by Rose - who holds a PhD in physics and a light-heavyweight world title in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - and his academic mentor Haig Farris.  \"The team spent about five years, with collaborators in various kinds of academic environments, coming to a view on the fastest way to come to market with something useful,\" says Mr Brownell.  The so-called gate model underpins the vast majority of academic research into quantum computing. This idea is based on developing the quantum equivalents of the logic gates that form the building blocks of circuits in classical computing. But D-Wave settled on an approach called quantum annealing. Outlined in   by Eddie Farhi of MIT, and others, this technique is fundamentally different to the theory of quantum gates. In Rose's chosen martial art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, opponents start off on their feet and typically end up grappling on the mat. The aim in quantum annealing is also to reach the \"ground state\" - in this case, the lowest energy point. One common analogy is that of a cross-section through a mountain range. The altitude of the landscape describes the energy, or cost, of the solution. The aim is to find the lowest point on the map and read the coordinates, as this gives the lowest energy, or \"best\", solution to the problem. \"The way you would do it in classical computing is to walk up and down the valleys and hills until you've found it,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a computing expert from the University of Surrey. \"What the quantum annealing process does for you is effectively to tunnel through the mountain... until it announces: 'The lowest point I found was X'.\" \"It shortcuts everything, and that's how it speeds up.\" Experts say quantum annealing can't offer the performance boost theoretically possible with gates, but proponents of D-Wave's approach point to innate advantages, such as greater robustness to the \"drop-out\" problem that plagues gate model quantum computing. Dr Rose has even branded quantum gates the \"single worst thing that ever happened to quantum computing\". Whatever the route taken, efforts to build a quantum computer must overcome daunting engineering hurdles. The circuits in D-Wave's processors are superconducting, which means they have zero electrical resistance and generate no heat. In order to get quantum effects, liquid helium is used to cool the chip to 0.02 Kelvin, a shade above the temperature known as absolute zero. The whole system is enclosed in a so-called Faraday Cage, which blocks external electrical fields that could interfere with quantum mechanical behaviour. I'm gently pleased by their boldness, to have a go and make the thing\u201d Prof Andrew Steane, from the department of physics at Oxford University, says: \"If you go back five or 10 years, the initial statements coming out of D-Wave - before they had a device to look at - were seen as something you could ignore, because it just didn't seem credible. \"Then they produced this device, so they came up with the goods. And it's a non-negligible device - it has serious computing power. It's just a question of whether what it's achieving is beyond what could have been done with a system based on classical physics.\" Significant academic effort is now being thrown at this question. Last year saw the publication of several scientific studies favourable to the company's case, including indirect evidence for entanglement of qubits and research by Catherine McGeoch, a professor of computer science at Amherst College, that found the system   than did a standard desktop machine. But in January 2014, a team led by Matthias Troyer, of ETH Zurich in Switzerland, published   of Lockheed's unit. Team members won't comment publicly until the work is published in a peer-reviewed journal, but in some tests devised by them, the D-Wave machine was found to perform no faster than a classical computer. However, company executives counter that the tests used were not the sort where the quantum computer offers any advantage over conventional types. Then in February, a team led by Prof Umesh Vazirani, of the University of California, Berkeley,   concluding that a simple, classical computing model of interacting magnets could explain behaviour in D-Wave's machines. In his response to an unfavourable   about the paper penned by Dr Rose, Prof Vazirani suggested that key questions might be answered if D-Wave were to grant researchers  , which is proprietary. However, not everyone thinks this would shed much light on the matter. What Geordie (Rose) said was - let's build what we can do, instead of always thinking about things that are out of reach\u201d \"At a high level, we know what the machine is doing: namely, it's doing annealing to the ground state, with superconducting Josephson junctions (paired superconductors) at 20mK (milliKelvin) temperature, in a way that's 'mostly classical' but that has some quantum effects present, at least at the local level,\" says Prof Aaronson. \"I think this research has actually reached some pretty firm conclusions: most importantly, that the current device is   getting a speedup on the problem distributions currently being tried,\" he explains. Andrew Steane says the computers show promise, but on the question of whether they are exploiting quantum effects for performance gains he says the studies by Troyer and Vazirani \"suggest they can't yet really make that claim\". But the company points to ongoing   and cites   from recent months that support their case.  Mr Brownell comments: \"How many trillions have been invested in classical computing? How many innovations and iterations of hardware since John Von Neumann and the Bletchley Park folks? \"How much algorithm work and research around software and applications and compilers and efficiency? We've come up with something in 10 years that performs just as well, and maybe outperforms in some narrow cases that entire ecosystem.\" Geordie Rose told BBC News: \"Scepticism implies a healthy and unbiased doubt about new technological capabilities or scientific advancements. Much of that has gone away as we've continued to advance our technology so far beyond what anyone else has done.\"   \"The negativity against pioneering companies though comes from small but vocal groups concerned about losing access to funding, and from commercial competitors. I believe the former will go away once these folks realise that our success means more money for their basic science, not less.\" D-Wave's next chip, consisting of 1,024-qubits, is currently undergoing calibration ahead of its planned release later this year. In addition to its aforementioned customers, D-Wave has others it won't name. The firm is now looking to expand into other potentially lucrative markets. \"As we get some more internal resources to support customers adequately, we would like to branch out into other areas like bioinformatics, energy exploration, finance,\" says Vern Brownell. \"We know already there are huge applications in each of these areas for quantum computing.\" Documents leaked by Edward Snowden reveal that the US National Security Agency (NSA)   to determine whether it was possible to build a quantum computer that would be useful for cracking encrypted communications.  But D-Wave's quantum annealing approach isn't well suited to this application. Cryptanalysis is an area where researchers seem to agree that the logic gate model offers more promise. Of the company's efforts, Alan Woodward says: \"The engineering difficulties [of building quantum computers] are enormous, because of susceptibilities to interactions from the environment and so on. What Geordie said was - let's build what we can, instead of always thinking about things that are out of reach. And you've got to admire that. \"I suspect it's something that's helping to move on the state-of-the-art from an engineering perspective, even if it turns out not to be the ultimate shape of things to come.\" Andrew Steane comments: \"I'm gently pleased by their boldness, to have a go and make the thing. \"It's a bit like 'Make it and they will come'. They haven't quite got to 'they will come'. But they've made something.\" Follow Paul  . ",

        "article": "Politics is one of the most complex areas of human thought. So when I heard the claim that scanning people's brains could predict political choices, I was naturally sceptical.  Brain science is achieving extraordinary insights, but mapping what you can measure in a brain scanner on to human social interactions is a huge leap, like trying to find exact correlations between two bowls of soup - only one soup is made from vegetables, macaroni and stock, and the other soup is made up of abstract ideas like economics, equality and history. But in the US and in Britain, psychologists and neuroscientists are doing serious research into linking political attitudes to what goes on inside our skulls.   \"By looking at how the brain is processing political phenomena, we can understand a little better why we're doing what we're doing,\" says Darren Schreiber, of Exeter University.  He started using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) while in America, to look at patterns of activity in the brain when people made decisions, especially those involving risk.  Writer and performer Timandra Harkness investigates how our political views are linked to the way our brains function. Personality Politics will be Broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 BST on Tuesday 20 May 2014 While their decisions weren't all that different, Dr Schreiber saw variation in the parts of the brain that were most active in self-described conservatives and those who called themselves liberal.  He won't generalise about exactly how conservatives and liberals think, but he does think his work suggests that differing political outlooks reflect deep-seated divergence in how we understand the world. Neuroscientist Read Montague, of University College London and Virginia Tech, was sceptical when approached to help political scientists with their research.  \"I laughed them out of the room,\" he says. But when John Hibbing and his team at the University of Nebraska showed him their data he changed his tune.  Their studies of twins suggested that political allegiance was partly genetic.  Not as strongly as height, for example, but enough to suggest that some people really could be dyed-in-the-wool conservatives - or dyed-in-the-DNA, at least. People like to believe that their own political beliefs are rational\u201d But how, exactly, could genetic differences be expressed as political differences in the real world?  Dr Hibbing and Dr Montague wanted to know if these innate predispositions could be observed at work in the brain.  So they tested instinctive responses to images designed to provoke disgust and fear, and found a link between the strength of response to the pictures, and how socially conservative a person's views were likely to be.  \"We need to make clear the distinction between economic conservatism and social conservatism,\" says Dr Hibbing.  \"People who have more protective attitudes about things like immigration, who are more eager to punish criminals, people who oppose abortion... these are individuals who seem to have a much stronger reaction to disgusting images.\"  These reactions are measured biologically, so the studies are linking explicit, conscious opinions with subconscious responses. In the research done so far, it's attitudes to risk, disgust and fear that show the strongest links to overt political views.  The difficulty comes when trying to apply these insights to a specific situation.  American social conservatives might also be strongly in favour of a smaller state and a freer market. In former Eastern bloc countries, social conservatism might make you more likely to hanker after the old days of Communism.  Behavioural economist Liam Delaney is studying the psychology of the Scottish independence referendum campaigns, but he warns against thinking that our subconscious instincts can be a complete guide to the debate.  Human politics is extraordinarily complex... If people were simplistic we wouldn't need these very big, complex brains\u201d \"Biological determinism is a little tricky with these situations, because there's just too much variation across different political systems.   \"So I think you'd risk simplifying things by saying that there is a hard-wire that's determining the outcome.\" Darren Schreiber agrees: \"Human politics is extraordinarily complex. It's not just reduced to brain, and I want to be very clear that I'm not a biological determinist. We're hardwired not to be hardwired.  \"If people were simplistic we wouldn't need these very big, complex brains.\" None of the scientists doing this research claims that our political views are completely innate.  Human brains change throughout our lives, so neuroscientists are careful to say that our experiences, as well as our genes, have shaped the brain they're putting in the scanner. But John Hibbing believes our subconscious drives, which evolved long ago in response to urgent physical dangers, direct our political minds more than we like to think.  \"People like to believe that their own political beliefs are rational, that they're a sensible response to the world around them, so when we come along and say, 'Maybe there are these predispositions, influential but perhaps not fully in your conscious awareness,' that's not the way we like to view our own political beliefs.\" He compares our innate ideological tendencies to which hand we prefer to use. We used to think of this as a habit that could be changed, yet now know it to be \"deeply embedded in biology\". That would have profound implications for political life. If being left-wing is as innate as being left-handed, why bother with politics at all?  Could we just put everybody in a brain scanner and infer what they think, and will always think, and were born to think, and stop trying to change anybody's mind? I was relieved to find that even John Hibbing doesn't draw that conclusion. \"It's not so much that I think people should just shut up and accept that some people are different. But I do think they should accept that some people are either not going to change or they're going to be extremely difficult to change, and that simply by continuing to shout at them, we're not contributing to anything.\" So we won't be swapping the ballot box for the brain scanner, any time soon.  Which is good, because I still think politics should be about taking our ideas out into the world beyond our skulls, the real world of challenging beliefs and clashing opinions. Perhaps I'm just hard-wired to think that way. ",

        "article": "It was just over three years ago that Rolex became Bloodhound's official timing partner. Their support has been invaluable in helping us to build the world's first 1,000mph car.  Rolex has also designed and made two key instruments for Bloodhound's cockpit, and this month we   for the first time.     When we first talked to Rolex, they were intrigued by our requirements for a precise and fail-safe cockpit speedometer, together with a chronometer/stop-watch.   After three years of work, they have produced the most accurate and reliable instruments ever to be fitted into a land speed record car.   The speedo is an essential back-up for Bloodhound, to make sure that I can stop the car safely at any stage.   If the main speed readout fails, I need to know exactly how fast the car is going, so that I can put the airbrakes and/or drag chutes out at the correct speed.   Deploy the chutes too fast and they will simply tear off, leaving Bloodhound SSC to run off the end of the track.  Deploy the chutes too late, and there will not be enough desert left to stop, and once again the car will run of the end.  With previous record cars, this has not really been a problem.   The chute speed limit is nearly 700mph, so they could be deployed at almost any stage, as even Thrust SSC was only above 700 for a few seconds.   However, Bloodhound's top speed of 1,000mph makes slowing down a more challenging problem, and the chute deployment speed is critical. Hence the need for the Rolex speedometer.   The speedo has its own GPS sensor, driven by an internal battery, to provide a precise and reliable speed readout.  Why use an analogue dial, rather than a digital readout? Simple - because it's the easiest type of display to read.   Jet fighters have analogue back-up instruments for exactly that reason.  The Rolex chronometer has a wider range of uses.    requires two passes through the measured mile, in opposite directions, within one hour.   I'm not going to be timing the hour precisely from the cockpit, as that's the timekeepers' job (I'll be plenty busy enough at 1,000mph without trying to hit the stopwatch as we enter the timing lights!).   However, keeping track of the time during our record attempts will be useful, as we get ready for the return record run.   I'll also be timing various systems on the car.  For instance, after a high-speed run the jet engine needs between two and five minutes at idle, to let it cool before I shut it down.   I'm betting that two minutes should be enough, while Rolls-Royce has been more cautious and advised five minutes. Like so many other details, this is something we'll test once we start running, to find out exactly how quickly the engine cools down.   If the Rolls-Royce team is reading this, then I promise we'll stick to your figures to start with!   Just like the speedometer, the chronometer is analogue, to make it easy to read.  The clock also takes its time signal from the GPS that drives the speedo, so it should be correct to about one millionth of a second.  That's accurate.   The build of the car's structure presses on.  For the first time in many months, the car got substantially longer this month, with the first sitting of  .  Nick-named \"the goat's head\", its four main components started life as 924kg of aluminium, provided by Thyssen-Krup.   Forged (heated and pressed under thousands of tonnes of pressure) four times for incredible strength, the material underwent 103 days of machining by AMRC in Sheffield.   You can see a video of the machining process in this  .  The final precision-made components weigh just 68kg and will support the huge loads (20+ tonnes) of Bloodhound's front suspension, while all the discarded metal is captured for recycling. These four main parts will be joined by 268 other bespoke components that make the main assembly, on to which we'll bolt the outboard wishbones, uprights and so on.  Almost all of those parts are in hand and the first mock-up assembly will start soon.   Manufacture of the fin parts is also going well, with all 31 of the small components now completed. The whole process will eventually turn three tonnes of aluminium into a total of 75kg machined structures, plus a lot more \"swarf\" for the recycling bin.   The skins will add another 30kg to the fin, to produce a structure over two metres tall.  It's already home to 20,000 names, so if you haven't added yours yet,   for a 1,000mph ride.    is now coming together quickly. This month we will have all the mechanical parts (less the doors themselves) to assemble the entire airbrake system for the first time on the car.   The airbrake doors will produce a total drag load of around five tonnes, all supported by the hinges, so they need to be strong.  That includes two small components machined by Top Gear's James May on his home lathe (not something most TV celebrities have, I'm guessing).   These are now with the team for rigorous quality checking.  Captain Slow working on the world's fastest car\u2026 welcome to the extraordinary world of Bloodhound! The hinge components will support the airbrake doors as they deploy at supersonic speeds, slowing Bloodhound down from 1,000mph in just over five miles.   In most sports, five miles sounds like a long way.  However, when you're doing a mile in 3.6 seconds, it doesn't seem quite so far.  Coming out of the measured mile at 1000+ mph, the airbrakes are going to be my best friends.   With the arrival of the airbrake parts, we now have all the components for the upper-rear chassis.   The assembly team has everything they need to drill off and \"skin pin\" the structure (skin pins are small screw-in metal pins that hold the structure together, while all the rivet holes are drilled and counter-sunk).   Once all the drilling is completed, we can then break down the assembly to anodise and prime the parts.   We will then bond and rivet the whole structure, which is going to be a busy job.  After we start to apply the bonding agent (Redux glue film), we've got 30 days to complete the assembly and get the whole structure into the autoclave at the National Composites Centre, to \"cook\" the glue.   During those 30 days, we've also got to insert 11,500 rivets.  It's going to be quite a race!  Once the upper chassis is completed, we can then test-fit the EJ200 jet engine into the car for the first time, and we're already working on the bits to \"hang\" the engine in the chassis. Won't be long now.   While we're working hard on the car, planning continues in the Northern Cape of South Africa for the arrival of Bloodhound next year.   Our Track Boss, Rudi, has just been out to   to have a look at the desert, after the recent rainy season.   For the first time, he was able to drive from one end to the other at high speed (for a normal car, that is), to look at the whole 12-mile length.   , which is nearly finished.   As Rudi succinctly put it: \"It's a relatively boring video, but I think that boring is what we are after.\"  Can't wait to drive down it at some proper high speeds, at which point things will become just a little bit more exciting.

        "article": "A month after the sinking of the Sewol ferry, divers are still trying to find the bodies of 23 missing people. Of the 476 who boarded the ship, 276 are confirmed dead, making it one of South Korea's worst maritime disasters.  This timeline explains what we know now about the tragic sequence of events.   :  The Sewol should have set sail on its regular overnight journey from Incheon to the volcanic island of Jeju at 18:30 on the evening of 15 April. It is delayed by fog and eventually departs at about 21:00.  According to the manifest, there are 476 people on board, 443 of whom are passengers, including a school party of 325 students and their teachers from Ansan high school.  However, the number of total passengers may have been higher.   : By morning the ship is sailing through a treacherous area of water near Jindo island when it makes a sharp turn and begins to list severely.  It is not clear why this sudden turn is made, but Captain Lee Joon-seok is not on the bridge at the time and an inexperienced third mate, Park Han-kyul is navigating.  Automatic Identification System data released later by authorities, shows that as the ferry turns, it loses control and begins drifting sideways. The Sewol quickly begins to capsize. : As the ship leans over, the first distress call comes not from the crew but from one of the students, a teenage boy who dials the national emergency number.  \"Save us! We're on a ship and I think it's sinking,\" the boy tells the fire officer on land who takes the call.   : A few minutes later, at 8:55, the crew calls for help, contacting Jeju Harbour Affairs. Transcripts reveal an   between the ship and shore.  Meanwhile announcements are broadcast telling passengers to stay where they are. Mobile phone footage retrieved from the victims later shows frightened students in life vests discussing whether to obey or try to escape.   Harbour Affairs at Jeju and at Jindo island, much closer to the ferry's location, both urge the crew to get passengers ready for evacuation.  But Captain Lee seeks assurance that rescue is at hand. He later says he was concerned that people would be swept away by currents if they entered the swift cold water.  The crew are also trapped in the bridge by the angle at which the ship is tilted and by fallen containers, so cannot reach the passengers.  : Coastguard boats and helicopters begin arriving. The captain says the ferry is now tilted 60 degrees.  : In the final communication, the crew says an evacuation order has been given and some passengers are escaping on the port side.  Over the next two hours, a total of 172 passengers and crew are rescued but many more are trapped inside as the ship slips beneath the waves.  The Sewol's owners, Chonghaejin Marine Company, redesigned the ferry to create additional passenger space, after purchasing it from Japanese owners in 2012.  It passed a safety inspection by the Korean Register of Shipping with the proviso that it would have to carry more ballast water and less cargo to offset the extra weight at the top.  However, investigators are looking at reports that the ferry was routinely overloaded. An off-duty captain also said he had  .  When disaster struck it was carrying 3,608 tonnes of cargo including 108 vehicles while the recommended limit was 987 tonnes.  It had 580 tonnes of ballast water on board, only 37% of the legal requirement, making it dangerously unbalanced, South Korean news agency Yonhap said, citing investigators.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Investigators are looking at reasons the Sewol capsized Chonghaejin Marine Company's financial records show that cargo had become an increasingly important part of its income in recent years as budget airlines cornered the passenger market.  Officials took the ship's entire navigational crew of 15 into custody and made further arrests on shore. The captain and three other crew have been  .   An interim investigation found that a sharp turn was the main cause of the sinking but the overloading of cargo and the lack of water in ballast tanks made recovery from its sharp turn difficult, Yonhap said.  Divers are still searching for bodies in the sunken ferry and only when the last has been found can a salvage operation begin.  Experts propose using a floating dock which would be positioned underneath the Sewol in order to bring it to the surface.  Parts of the hull have started to collapse and although sea cranes are already on the scene, raising the ship is a complex operation, likely to take several months. ",

        "article": "A Soyuz capsule returned to Earth on Wednesday with its international cosmonauts. Russian Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Japan's Koichi Wakata had spent 188 days orbiting the planet on the International Space Station.  As is customary, the trio were lifted out of their craft and put in chairs. Thumbs-up and smiles all round. The picture of co-operation. But the space programme is increasingly wearing a frown also, as the fallout from Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea touches all aspects of international relations. And not even 400km above the Earth, it seems, can you escape geopolitics. For the moment, the orbiting platform continues to sail serenely around the globe at 27,000km/h, but on Earth things are a little bumpier.  A series of tit-for-tat gestures is raising tensions. The US put restrictions on its federal officials meeting with their Russian counterparts, and banned some technology exports. This could have had a major impact on the US space agency (Nasa) and its dealing with its Russian counterpart, Roscosmos, but the White House said matters relating to the space station were exempt, and that\u2019s where most co-operative activity between the pair takes place. Now, the Russians have hit back by saying they will stop the export of rocket engines to the US if they're to be used to launch American military hardware \u2013 something they routinely do when attached to the first-stage of the Atlas rocket.  Several of these vehicles a year will loft spacecraft for the US Air Force or the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Russia is also threatening to shut down monitoring stations on its soil that support services based on American Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, although Moscow says this is more directly a response to Washington's refusal to allow stations to be built on US soil to support Glonass, the Russians' own sat-nav network. There's talk, too, of Russia perhaps not agreeing to extend space station operations beyond 2020 \u2013 something the rest of the international partners on the project would like to do.  Stirring the pot is Russia\u2019s deputy Prime Minister, Dmitry Rogozin, who is in charge of space and defence industries. And he really likes to stir.   and you'll see what I mean.  When the US introduced its technology sanctions,  : \"After analysing the sanctions against our space industry I suggest the US delivers its astronauts to the ISS with a trampoline. US Lets Down Its ISS Astronauts By Sanctions Against Russian Space Programme.\" He even posted a picture of trampoline with a Nasa badge.  It's a joke playing on the fact that the US must now buy seats in Russian Soyuz capsules if it wants to get its astronauts to the space station. After the retirement of the shuttles in 2011, there is currently no home-grown alternative. A lot of this is huff and puff, of course. But the Russians need to be careful.  They are currently earning a tidy sum out of the Americans. The export of RD-180 rocket engines for the Atlas vehicles is worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the Russian space industry. And every one of those Soyuz seats to the ISS is bought for a ticket price that exceeds $60m.  Sabre rattling risks these profitable endeavours.  Already, there are noises in the US Congress that money should be made available to American industry to help design and build an indigenous Atlas first-stage engine.  And circling is Elon Musk of California\u2019s upstart SpaceX company, which wants to sweep all before it by substituting both the Atlas and the Soyuz with the highly competitive Falcon rocket. All Musk's technology is US-built and a lot cheaper to boot.  The Russians therefore have much to lose, financially. But perhaps the saddest aspect of all this is that space endeavour should be touched at all. It was of course in orbit that the US and the Soviet Union first defrosted relations with the  . That co-operation was then built on with the highly successful  , which saw the American orbiters visit the old Russian space station throughout the 1990s.  And today we have the ISS - a shining star for international unity, with astronauts and cosmonauts of many nationalities \u2013 not just American and Russian - working very effectively side by side. That's not something anyone should want to sully. ",
