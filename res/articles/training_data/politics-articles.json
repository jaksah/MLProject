        "article": "Attorney General Dominic Grieve is to discuss failed sexual assault and rape cases brought against high profile figures with the director of public prosecutions (DPP) Alison Saunders. It follows criticism of prosecutors after actors Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell were cleared by juries. Some Conservative MPs have also questioned the decision to charge Ribble Valley MP Nigel Evans. Mr Evans was acquitted - but the DPP  has defended the decision to prosecute. The former Conservative deputy speaker of the House of Commons, was acquitted of nine sex abuse charges, including rape, at Preston Crown Court on Thursday. The attorney general's office stressed Mr Grieve and the (DPP) hold meetings roughly every fortnight, and typically discuss major cases after the verdicts. A spokesman for the attorney general's office said: \"The running of individual cases is a matter for the independent CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and the DPP.  \"However, as part of his role superintending the CPS, and as would be normal in high-profile cases such as these, the attorney general will discuss these cases with the DPP at their next regular meeting.\" They are expected to meet after Easter. BBC  political correspondent Ross Hawkins said long standing protocol meant the attorney general did not talk to the DPP about cases once charges involving politicians have been brought until their conclusion. Mr Roache was cleared of rape and indecent assault in February and Mr Le Vell was acquitted of a number of child sex abuse charges in September last year. Prof Liz Kelly, director of the child and woman abuse studies unit in London,   she feared the debate around Mr Evans's trial was sending an \"extremely negative message to survivors of sexual violence\". \"At this time of ongoing high-profile trials, political interference undermining work to improve prosecutions of sexual offences should desist,\" she said. Critics of the CPS, including some Tory MPs, have said it must avoid bringing together a series of weak cases in an attempt to form a strong one. Ms Saunders defended the decision to take the case against Nigel Evans to court. She said the CPS was not on a mission to pursue famous people, but prosecuted every case in the same way. She said she would look at the case to see if lessons could be learned - as was normal with all acquittals - but she rejected any widespread change to CPS procedures in such cases. \"I think we made the right decision in taking it before the court,\" Ms Saunders said. \"We looked at all the evidence and decided there was a realistic prospect of conviction. And what we have to remember is that juries apply a very different, much higher test which is, are they satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt?\" She insisted the CPS would continue to take difficult cases to court provided they satisfied its test.

Not all Tories are convinced about the new code, as Vicky Young reports The Conservative Party has issued a voluntary code of conduct to all its MPs telling them not to \"bully, abuse or harass\" their employees.  Staff were entitled to \"work in an environment free from unwelcome behaviour and inappropriate language\", the document says. The move comes amid concerns over the working culture in Westminster.  Commons Speaker John Bercow has plans to launch a hotline for staff with concerns about bulling.  And an investigation by Channel 4 News, broadcast on Thursday,   in a survey of parliamentary workers. The programme said it had interviewed 70 people from \"all political parties and sexual orientations\", and found that incidents of sexual harassment and abuse of power in Parliament were commonplace. Young men were more likely to be sexually harassed than women, it concluded.  A Conservative spokesman explained: \"The code of conduct acts as a basic statement of what should be best practice in the workplace for Conservative members and their staff.\"  People are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect as they carry out their work\u201d \"It is based upon a three-stage process of mediation, grievance hearing and appeal.  \"The process conforms to relevant employment law, ACAS guidance and HR best practice and is added as a schedule to the contract of employment.\" . It says employees have the right to: MPs were expected to:  Labour said that its MPs had a \"long-standing complaints procedure in its rules and has never tolerated unacceptable behaviour\". But it is nonetheless in the process of establishing \"an independent complaints process which will apply to every member of the Parliamentary Labour Party\", a spokesperson added.  \"These changes will make sure there is a clear, independent process for people who work for MPs to make a complaint about serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour.  \"These proposals have been drafted in conjunction with lawyers, HR professionals and trade unions who represent the staff of many MPs and peers.\" Commons speaker John Bercow is planning to launch a confidential hotline for MPs or staff who feel they have been the victim of bullying or harassment. In a statement, Mr Bercow said bullying and harassment in the workplace was \"completely unacceptable\" and that he would now look into whether procedures in Parliament were in need of reform. \"People are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect as they carry out their work,\" he said. \"The experience of working in Parliament for an MP should be positive and fulfilling. Time and again, people have told me how fortunate they feel to work here. \"That said, having learned for the first time this afternoon of these allegations, I will consider if there are lessons for the House of Commons to learn or procedures to be reformed. \"MPs are self-employed and employ their staff directly. The House, therefore, is limited in its ability to intervene in cases in which allegations of bullying or harassment by MPs of their staff are concerned. These cases are clearly a matter for the political parties.\" Emma Grossmith, senior solicitor at legal firm Just Employment Law, said that some MPs were likely to be \"first-time employers\", who \"may not always have been as robust in their employment practices as they ought\". She added: \"It is certainly prudent for the Conservative Party to articulate its expectations.  \"But this alone will not be enough to protect MPs from claims. Proper training for both employers and staff is the only way to ensure a permanent culture change.\" ",

        "article": "Chancellor George Osborne has hailed the UK's economic recovery in a keynote speech in Washington DC. Mr Osborne said critics of the government's economic plan have been proved \"comprehensively wrong\". His speech comes a year after the International Monetary Fund said Mr Osborne's austerity policies were \"playing with fire\". Labour said Mr Osborne was \"out of touch\" with the millions of people in the UK facing a cost-of-living crisis. Speaking while in the US capital for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, the chancellor said that cutting deficits and controlling spending had \"laid the foundations for sustainable growth\". Mr Osborne admitted \"many risks remain\" but said there was cause for \"cautious optimism\". \"It's only by continuing to work through our long-term economic plan that we can deliver more economic security and a brighter future for all,\" he said. His visit comes after the latest IMF forecasts predicted the UK would be the fastest-growing major economy this year. Mr Osborne used his keynote speech to reject the arguments of the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who warned last year that the UK's austerity policies were strangling growth. And the chancellor also dismissed suggestions that the West is locked in a cycle of economic stagnation, declaring: \"Our nations' best days lie ahead.\" He said that the strengthening economy in Britain is underpinned by well-capitalised banks and a \"credible\" fiscal policy. \"Our economy has grown faster than any other in the G7 over the last year and is now forecast by the IMF to do the same in 2014,\" Mr Osborne said in his address to the American Enterprise Institute think tank. \"This is despite warnings from some that our determined pursuit of our economic plan made that impossible. \"All of this demonstrates that fiscal consolidation and economic recovery go together, and undermines the pessimistic prognosis that only further fiscal stimulus can drive sustainable growth.  \"Indeed, that is precisely the wrong prescription for our economies. \"Instead of more debt or more government spending, we need to get our public finances in order, make structural reforms and compete in the world again.\" But Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The last thing millions of people facing a cost-of-living crisis want to hear is an out-of-touch chancellor trying to tell them everything is going well. \"In 2010 George Osborne promised sustained rises in living standards, a secured rather than choked-off recovery and the books balanced by 2015. On every single pledge he has badly failed.\" Mr Leslie said Labour's plans would \"boost living standards for all\" and \"secure a strong and balanced recovery\". ",

        "article": "A male hierarchy at Parliament is part of \"a recipe for a culture in which sexual harassment can prevail,\" Labour's deputy leader has said. Harriet Harman said the problem was also caused by \"the hours, and people being away from home\". A voluntary code of conduct has been issued to Conservative MPs telling them not to \"bully, abuse or harass\" staff. Conservative Douglas Carswell said a power to recall MPs would raise standards at Westminster. Ms Harman said Labour was reviewing its codes of conduct. A Channel 4 News investigation this week reported that a third of the young men and women working in Parliament said they had suffered sexual harassment.  It said young men were more likely to be sexually harassed than women, with 40% of the men interviewed saying they had received unwanted sexual advances. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today, Ms Harman said: \"When it comes to sexual harassment we certainly have been looking again at our codes of conduct which we've had for some time in the party, which sets out specifically what behaviour is not acceptable for an employer towards their employee in terms of sexual harassment and what the procedures are to deal with it. She added: \"I think the truth is that an awareness of how a male hierarchy can deal with often young women in a junior position is not a unique problem for Westminster. \"I think there's been a greater understanding that there needs to be better treatment of people at work.\" Ms Harman said: \"Certainly when I first arrived if you had very, very long hours, people working beyond 10pm.  \"If you have people away from home and you have a male hierarchy, that is a recipe for a culture in which sexual harassment can prevail. \"And therefore you have to have very strong procedures and send down the message that this is not acceptable, that you should be encouraged to complain and your complaint will be dealt with.\" Maria Miller MP resigned as culture secretary this week after a row over her expenses. Ms Harman called for the MPs' allowances system to be reformed again. I think what we need ultimately is a right for voters to intervene and to sack MPs; that means a right of recall\u201d She said: \"I do think we need to change the system on expenses ... because it is unfinished business in terms of assuring the public that we really have sorted the situation out.\" Mr Carswell, Conservative MP for Clacton, told Today he did not recognise Channel 4's descriptions of Parliament as the \"Palace of Sexminster\". He said: \"Of course, if you have 650 bosses in effect, you are going to get some who aren't very good at managing people. \"Of course we need to raise standards, but I slightly wince when I hear this term 'professionalise'. \"I think it's the professionalisation of politics that's got us into this sorry state, where a lot of voters don't have confidence and trust in their elected representatives. \"The way to raise standards is to make MPs properly, outwardly accountable to the voter,\" he added. \"I think what we need ultimately is a right for voters to intervene and to sack MPs; that means a right of recall. \"Until we get that, no amount of tinkering, no amount of quango changing in Westminster, is going to restore confidence and trust.\" He said: \"If one in five voters signs a petition demanding a recall ballot there should be a recall election. \"I think we should trust the people, just as we trust juries in a court, to determine guilt.\" ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. First Minister Alex Salmond describes the No campaign as \"laughable\" Scotland's first minister has branded the campaign for the Union \"the most miserable, negative, depressing and thoroughly boring\" in modern times. Alex Salmond told the SNP conference Better Together was out of touch with reality, while momentum was building towards a \"Yes\" for independence. He also used his speech to reach out to women voters, announcing an increase in female representation in his cabinet. But the Better Together campaign said Mr Salmond was not giving the answers. Mr Salmond's speech came ahead of the 18 September independence referendum. The ballot will see voters asked the Yes/No question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" So, a direct pitch to the female vote - he promoted two more women to his Cabinet, he announced that future Scottish Cabinets would be at least 40% female, and he emphasised the Scottish government offer to enhance childcare post independence\u201d Polls currently indicate support for the Union, but the Scottish government says momentum is moving towards its position. Mr Salmond's speech came after recent remarks by former Nato secretary general and Scottish Labour MP Lord George Robertson, who said Scottish independence would be \"cataclysmic\" for the West in an era of international turmoil. The SNP leader said: \"The more the people of Scotland hear the case for 'No', the more likely they are to vote 'Yes'. \"And no wonder - they are the most miserable, negative, depressing and thoroughly boring campaign in modern political history. \"They are already out of touch with the people and now, I fear, they're losing touch with reality.\" In contrast, Mr Salmond said, the \"Yes\" campaign was \"positive, uplifting and hopeful\", adding: \"That is the basis on which we shall win this referendum and shall win our independence.\" The Scottish government argues Scotland is the 14th richest country among the world's most developed nations, and with independence, would be able to take control of its own resources. Under independence, the SNP government has pledged a massive expansion in childcare, which it says would help women back to work and boost the economy. Mr Salmond also said the SNP, under independence, would want companies to aspire to see their boards made up of at least 40% women. The first minister announced junior ministers Shona Robison, who oversees equality and Angela Constance, who has the youth employment brief, would be made full Scottish cabinet members. He added: \"Subject to parliamentary approval, with these two outstanding ministers in the Scottish cabinet, we practice what we preach. \"The cabinet is our board as a country, and women will make up 40% of the members of the Scottish cabinet.\" Looking ahead to 18 September, Mr Salmond said the referendum was not about the SNP, him or the wider \"Yes\" campaign. He told the packed conference hall: \"It's about putting Scotland's future in Scotland's hands.\" \"A 'Yes' vote in September is not a vote for an SNP government in 2016.  Voters in Scotland will go to the polls to vote on their country's future.  They will be asked the yes/no question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\"  The vote takes place on Thursday, 18 September, 2014. \"It's a vote for a government in Scotland that the people of Scotland choose, pursuing policies the people of Scotland support. \"It is a vote for a government in control of tax, the economy, social security, employment, immigration oil and gas revenues, European policy and a range of other areas currently under Westminster control.\" The first minister went on: \"That may be the SNP. It may be Labour. It may be a coalition.\" In an attack on the Conservatives, he added: \"I tell you what it won't be - it won't be a government led by a party with just a single member of parliament in Scotland. \"A government dismantling our welfare state. Determined to privatise public services.\" Mr Salmond went on: \"In an independent Scotland, we can give this guarantee: the era of unelected Tory governments handing out punishment to the poor and the disabled will be gone and gone for good.\" In the event of a 'Yes' vote, the first minister told the conference, talks with Westminster on the transition to independence would begin before the end of September. The \"team Scotland\" negotiating group would include non-SNP members and expertise from across the political spectrum, from both inside and outside Scotland. However, Better Together's campaign director, Blair McDougall, said of Mr Salmond's attack: \"There's something deeply ironic about someone being quite so negative in complaining about negativity, but I can't think of anything more negative than risking people's pensions, people's jobs, people's mortgages, which is exactly what Alex Salmond has done today.   \"He's still giving us no answers to the really big questions that people need answers to before they go to vote in September.\" ",

David Cameron described Offa's Dyke as the line between life and death Prime Minister David Cameron said Wales was witnessing a \"national scandal\" as Offa's Dyke \"has become the line between life and death\".  Addressing the Welsh Conservative conference in Llangollen, Mr Cameron said the healthcare workforce were being \"woefully let down by Labour\".  He criticised Welsh Labour on education and the NHS, saying patients were waiting too long for heart scans.  He said Welsh Labour was guilty of \"appalling, inexcusable complacency\". \"One in seven people in Wales is on an NHS waiting list,\" he said. \"A cancer drugs fund is in England - but not here. After this utter shambles Labour should never dare call themselves the party of the NHS again\u201d \"I tell you - when Offa's Dyke becomes the line between life and death, we are witnessing a national scandal.\" He said families had seen loved ones waiting too long for treatment - and they were \"sometimes dying\". \"After this utter shambles Labour should never dare call themselves the party of the NHS again,\" he said. \"Welsh Conservatives are arguing heart and soul that it doesn't have to be this way... with real courage and reform, things can be different.\" Mr Cameron insisted the Tories were arguing for more funding, more transparency, more power to doctors and nurses.  It comes on the day a key report said NHS funding cuts may be behind longer waiting times but Wales was not lagging behind the rest of the UK. He also talked about education, saying it was a \"competitive world, it's not softer subjects and 'experimental' teaching these children need\". \"It's proper spelling in English, basic arithmetic in maths, the best of our history, proper respected exams,\" he said. \"It's not more of this failed, left-wing, ideological clap-trap we need... it's more rigour, more standards, more choice, more hope.\" Mr Cameron said his party was ambitious for Wales and insisted the Conservatives' long-term economic plan was working.  He said Wales was now the \"UK capital for jobs growth\". He also said the Conservatives had agreed to the largest investment in Welsh railways since the Victorian era, including electrifying the mainlines to Cardiff and Swansea. During his speech Mr Cameron said he believed in devolving income tax. He has already offered such powers subject to a referendum.  He told delegates he would like to see the Welsh government being more responsible for raising the money it spent.  Earlier, UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt launched his strongest attack on the NHS in Wales claiming it is \"sleepwalking to a Mid Staffs tragedy\". Mr Hunt criticised Wales' record on waiting times and ambulance targets. He admitted things can go wrong. \"In a system as big and complex as the NHS things do go wrong,\" he told the conference. \"But if you ignore the evidence when individual problems pile up, if you stick your head in the sand and pretend all will be fine... well, that's exactly what happened at Mid Staffs under the last Labour government in England. \"And that is what the Labour government in Cardiff is risking right now in Wales. \"They are sleepwalking into a Welsh Mid Staffs tragedy and unless we shout loud enough - alongside brave campaigners like Ann Clwyd, Gareth Williams and others who tragically lost loved ones in Welsh hospitals - these appalling lapses in care will repeat themselves time after time.\" It is not the first time Mr Hunt has criticised the NHS in Wales. In February, he claimed patients were suffering because Labour Welsh ministers were not investigating high death rates in hospitals. Mr Hunt called it a \"tragedy\" that the Welsh NHS was not adopting reforms introduced in England since the Stafford Hospital scandal. Since he made the statement a new version of Welsh hospital death rates has been published, which takes into account differences between Wales and England. Figures from six hospitals with above-average death rates are being reviewed by an independent expert, to establish whether they need further investigation.

        "article": "David Cameron has spoken of the \"peace\" and \"guidance\" he finds in his Christian faith. In a rare comment on his religious beliefs, the prime minister stressed the importance of teaching children about the religious aspects of Easter. He told BBC Radio Norfolk he wanted Nancy, Arthur and Florence to understand that the festival was more than just \"chocolate eggs\".  It comes as Downing Street released Mr Cameron's Easter  In it, he says: \"Easter is not just a time for Christians across our country to reflect, but a time for our whole country to reflect on what Christianity brings to Britain.\" He speaks of the \"countless acts of kindness\" carried out every day across the UK by \"those who believe in and follow Christ\". \"The heart of Christianity is to 'love thy neighbour' and millions do really live that out,\" he added, praising Alpha courses run in prisons and the \"spirit\" shown by those who had helped rescue residents during the winter storms across southern England. There is something about political leaders and their aides being asked about their Christianity that leads to memorable soundbites. Or perhaps it is because it is a topic they often avoid and so any reference to it is remembered. Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell was once reported to have batted away a question to the then PM about his faith by saying: \"We don't do God.\" And David Cameron, when he was leader of the opposition, borrowed a Boris Johnson analogy to compare his belief to the signal of a London radio station in the Chilterns. In other words, a bit patchy. Intriguingly, that signal seems rather clearer now.  Three times this week the prime minister has talked with conviction about his faith and what he believes Christianity brings to the UK. It's a message from an instinctively \"county Tory\", a Conservative from a rural background, that will appeal to the party heartlands; where some feel bruised by what they see as liberal, metropolitan concerns such as gay marriage. He said the government had increased funding for the Near Neighbours programme, which encourages members of different faith groups in the inner cities to work together on \"social action\" projects. Mr Cameron held a reception for Christian leaders in Downing Street on Wednesday, following a day dominated by the resignation of Culture Secretary Maria Miller after a row over her expenses. \"The Bible tells us to bear one another's burdens. After the day I've had I'm definitely looking for volunteers,\" he told the gathering. According to  the prime minister made no reference to gay marriage, a policy overseen by Mrs Miller but which threatened to damage his government's relationship with the Church of England, in his comments. Instead, he thanked churches for the work they did with the poor and urged them to speak up for Christians suffering persecution around the world. He said his \"moments of greatest peace\" occurred every other Thursday morning, when he attended Eucharist at St Mary Abbots, the west London church linked to the school his children attend. \"I find a little bit of peace and hopefully a bit of guidance,\" he added. Mr Cameron is said to have referred to Jesus Christ as \"our saviour\" during the talk. In an interview with BBC Norfolk on Thursday, Mr Cameron said he and his children mulled over \"what Easter is all about\" as they ate breakfast that morning. \"I was very impressed with their knowledge about Good Friday and Easter Sunday,\" he said. \"We had a bit of a conversation about that, (that) it wasn't about chocolate eggs. \"That was one of the themes at breakfast in the Cameron household.\" In 2009, Mr Cameron told BBC One's Songs of Praise: \"I believe in God and I'm a Christian and I worship - not as regularly as I should - but I go to church. \"Do I drop to my knees and ask for guidance whenever an issue comes up? No, I don't. But it's part of who I am.\" British politicians have traditionally shied away from talking about their own religious beliefs in public, an attitude summed up by Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who in 2003 was reported to have said: \"We don't do God.\" Mr Blair was received into the Roman Catholic faith after leaving office and set up a Faith Foundation to promote better understanding between religious groups around the world.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said it was important not to ''shy away'' from difficult cases The director of public prosecutions has said the Crown Prosecution Service was right to take the Nigel Evans sex abuse case to court. Alison Saunders said the CPS was not \"on a mission\" to pursue famous people and insisted it would not \"shy away\" from difficult cases. Former Commons deputy speaker Mr Evans was cleared of nine sex abuse charges. Calls have since been made for a review of some judicial processes, with claims his case should not have gone to court. Former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald warned that prosecutors needed to \"keep a cool head\" in investigations of historical abuse cases.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Without commenting directly on Mr Evans's case, he told the Times that prosecutors should avoid \"going on a mission\" and losing perspective. But Ms Saunders rejected suggestions the CPS was \"star-struck\". She told the BBC: \"We apply the same test no matter who the offender or the victim is, and it's very important that we do that.\" She said she would look at the Evans case to see if lessons could be learned - as was normal with all acquittals - but she rejected any widespread change to CPS procedures in such cases. \"I think we made the right decision in taking it before the court,\" Ms Saunders said. \"We looked at all the evidence and decided there was a realistic prospect of conviction. And what we have to remember is that juries apply a very different, much higher test which is, are they satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt?\" She insisted the CPS would continue to take difficult cases to court provided they satisfied its test. The head of the CPS in north west England, where Mr Evans serves as MP for Ribble Valley, backed Ms Saunders' remarks. Nazir Afzal told BBC North West Tonight: \"We don't care who the complainant is, we don't care who's being complained against, we look at the evidence.  \"The evidence is what drives us... and we allow ultimately only those cases where there's a realistic prospect [of a conviction] to go to court.\" Their comments followed Lord Macdonald's warning. He said prosecutors should not only bring \"sure-fire winners\" to court - that \"challenging\" cases needed to be prosecuted too. \"What the CPS needs to avoid, however, is going on a mission and losing perspective,\" he said. \"This particularly applies to historical cases which have garnered a lot of publicity. You have to keep a cool head.\" Lord Macdonald also   the CPS had to be \"very careful to avoid a situation where they regard a series of weak cases as amounting to a strong case\". The CPS has maintained it was right that all the evidence in the case of Mr Evans was put before a jury, but added that it respected the court's decision to clear him of all the charges. But some MPs have criticised the CPS and police after Mr Evans's acquittal. Conservative MP David Davis, a former shadow home secretary, called for an urgent review, saying there was \"a risk of a serious injustice\" under the current system. Mr Davis said: \"This case has highlighted serious concerns over how the police and the Crown Prosecution Service bring sexual offence cases to court. \"In particular we must now review the process whereby the police and the Crown Prosecution Service put together a large number of lesser, subsidiary cases in order to reinforce one serious case when prosecuting sexual offences.\" Christine Hamilton, wife of former Conservative MP Neil Hamilton, accused the CPS of wasting taxpayers' money. Mrs Hamilton and her husband were arrested in 2001 by police investigating an allegation of rape which turned out to be entirely false.  Mrs Hamilton told the BBC she believed the CPS and police were on a mission to target high-profile figures because they felt \"guilt-ridden\" in the wake of the Jimmy Savile inquiry. She said there had been a \"mini torrent\" of arrests, which had wasted money and \"destroyed\" lives, including Mr Evans's. \"How much has this cost? And could that money not be better spent by the CPS and the police in pursuing real criminals?\" she said. Mrs Hamilton said there had been \"two or three\" witnesses who did not consider themselves \"victims\". \"The CPS, if they knew that, why on earth did they bring these people to court?\" she added. But director of public prosecutions Ms Saunders said research had found that victims did not always see themselves as victims, citing domestic abuse as an example.  She said the CPS prosecuted more than 730,000 cases each year and had a conviction rate of 86%. \"If a case satisfies the evidential test and it's in the public interest to prosecute it, we will prosecute,\" she said. \"And it would be wrong and we would be rightly criticised if we didn't take cases just because we were being overly cautious and we would be failing in our duty to victims and society.\" Mr Evans was cleared of a string of sex abuse charges, including one of rape. The rape claim was among several allegations made by seven men during a five-week trial at Preston Crown Court. Mr Evans was said to have used his political influence to take advantage of his alleged victims but the defence pointed out inconsistencies in various witness accounts. The former Conservative MP, 56, currently sits as the independent member for Ribble Valley. ",

        "article": "Lord Tebbit has conceded he made a mistake when he said he hoped Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness would be shot. The Conservative peer, whose wife was paralysed by an IRA bomb, had suggested dissident republicans would shoot him for attending a Royal banquet.  His remarks were criticised as \"highly dangerous\" by Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers.  Lord Tebbit said he now regretted the trouble his comments had caused. When asked if he would withdraw his remarks, Lord Tebbit said: \"I don't think I would advise anyone or entreaty anybody to shoot Mr McGuinness - I would welcome it if he was brought to trial, of course.\"  Mr McGuinness has previously received death threats from dissident republican paramilitaries over Sinn F\u00e9in's support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He had described Lord Tebbit's initial comments as \"absolutely dismaying\". Lord Tebbit said the criticism of his remarks by Mr McGuinness were \"a bit rich\".  \"When he has owned up to the crimes that were plotted and carried out by the IRA when he was a leader and could have said 'no we must not do that', when he has pleaded for forgiveness and expressed his repentance, then of course I would be very pleased to meet him and talk about those things,\" he said.  Lord Tebbit said his wife Margaret had not been in good health since she was injured in the 1984 bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Conservative Party's conference.  \"She is in a great deal of pain, she is extremely limited in what she can do and she is entirely dependent on people to look after her,\" he said.  \"We are not able to go on a holiday or anything of that kind, and she can scarcely go to visit anyone because there are very few places that are adequately equipped for her to be looked after.  \"She lives a very restricted life - she is in prison.\" ",

        "article": "MPs scared of negative publicity are \"secretly\" recruiting unpaid interns to work in their offices, it is alleged. Charles Glover, an aide to Lib Dem MP John Leech, made the claim while defending his boss, who has come under fire for advertising eight unpaid roles. Campaigners say some MPs are exploiting people by not paying the minimum wage. But Mr Glover says interns gain valuable experience that helps them get paid jobs at Westminster. The number of MPs advertising for unpaid office staff on the official Commons job board  has dramatically fallen in recent years after a spate of negative publicity.  The expenses watchdog, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), has  , with MPs now told anyone working for them must be paid the national minimum wage, and that only genuine volunteers can support them unpaid. Mr Glover said MPs could not afford to pay all the staff they need, and previous applicants from humble backgrounds had gone on to forge careers in politics, after he was criticised by campaigner Tanya de Grunwald on her Graduate Fog blog. He said Mr Leech was being open about his recruitment of unpaid staff - in contrast to other MPs, who were recruiting people \"secretly\" because they were worried about a media backlash. Campaigns against unpaid interns were driving the recruitment process underground, further entrenching the Westminster \"closed shop\" that voters say they hate, he argued. \"People are applying directly and getting taken on directly,\" he told BBC News. \"I know it happens. I know people that it has happened to. But they are loath to say it in public. I also know it is being used to push down wages. \"People who used to get a Westminster wage are now getting a minimum intern wage.\" Unpaid internships exploit those who do them and exclude those who can't afford to do them\u201d In his advert, Mr Leech, the Member for Withington, in Manchester, offered full-time roles for three months or 12 months part-time, to include training in everything from speechwriting and media work to managing the MP's diary. It called for \"computer and writing skills\", an \"energetic can-do attitude\" and \"excellent interpersonal skills and a sense of humour\". But it also stressed that it was a voluntary role and \"as such there are no set hours and responsibilities, and you should be free to come and go as you wish\". Kelley Ireland, 22, a paid parliamentary aide to Lib Dem peer Baroness Williams, said she had got her foot on the Westminster career ladder by answering an advert for an unpaid volunteer in Mr Leech's Manchester office. Ms Ireland, who says she did not come from a political family and attended a state school, worked as a carer to support herself while volunteering for a year at Mr Leech's Manchester and London offices. \"I was just so glad to have the opportunity to work in his office, and I was willing to work in the evenings and at weekends in order to do that, and I didn't ever begrudge him for that. I learned so much in that period,\" she told BBC News. She said MPs should be paid a greater staff allowance to allow them to pay their interns - otherwise interns would increasingly be recruited \"in secret\" without a public application process.  \"There's quite a few people I know within Westminster now who are doing internships purely because of who they know and because they know someone in that office. They come in one day a week, or several days.\" She said unpaid internships were not being advertised in the way they had been in the past because they are seen as \"toxic\". But she added: \"You need the experience to get a paid job.\" Tanya de Grunwald, who first reported Mr Leech's latest job ads, placing them on her blog's   - said there could be no excuse for not paying workers. \"The claim that many of Leech's fellow MPs are now hiring unpaid interns secretly is shocking - but so is the claim that their grubby behaviour is somehow the fault of campaigners like me,\" she told BBC News.  \"MPs, including Leech, must understand that the law is the law - and public opinion is against them on this one.\" She added: \"Unpaid internships exploit those who do them and exclude those who can't afford to do them. End of story.\" Former Labour minister Hazel Blears has called for unpaid internships to be made illegal. A spokesman for the Salford and Eccles MP said she had not been made aware of any MPs attempting to get round the rules by recruiting interns informally. \"If it was happening, that would obviously be a concern. But it does not mean that we should allow the potential exploitation of people. \"You have got to deal with one problem at a time.\" He said some people may be able to support themselves financially while working in an MP's office but many more would not be able to and would, therefore, be excluded from a career in politics. Ms Blears is encouraging people of all ages to apply for a paid internship in Parliament through the , which is backed by commercial sponsors including Royal Mail and construction company CH2M Hill.

        "article": "Irish President Michael D Higgins has flown home after the end of his historic four-day state visit to the UK. The Queen hosted two banquets for her Irish guest at Windsor Castle and he addressed both Houses of Parliament. Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina visited Stratford-upon-Avon and Coventry on their final day. Before leaving for Dublin Mr Higgins said he had been moved by the reception he and his wife had received. He also told those who were unhappy with the visit to \"think of all the things we have in common\". And when he was asked about the involvement of former IRA leader Martin McGuinness in the visit, Mr Higgins said it was \"very important that all those involved participated fully\". Mr McGuinness, who is Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, attended the state banquet on Tuesday and joined in the toast to the Queen. The Sinn F\u00e9in MLA said his participation in the royal reception was in aid of \"conflict resolution and reconciliation\". The presidential visit was aimed at celebrating and strengthening British and Irish links. It followed the Queen's first state visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, which was widely hailed as a diplomatic triumph and a milestone in Anglo-Irish relations. Mr and Mrs Higgins said goodbye to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Windsor Castle on Friday morning, before leaving for their final engagements. They travelled to Stratford-upon-Avon to visit the birthplace of William Shakespeare and the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). In addition to his political career, Mr Higgins is a well-known poet and author, while his wife is an actress. President Higgins made a speech about the English language, its role in Ireland, and about the shared dialogue between two islands.  He said: \"It is the business of living souls to breathe life into words, and I have no doubt but that our long conversation in a shared language will continue into the far future to breathe new life, and the lightning of our different imaginations, into a common human purpose.\" Approximately 2,000 people turned out in warm spring sunshine to see the arrival of Irish President Michael D Higgins in Coventry.  The atmosphere was joyful as the city's large Irish population gathered and a cheer went up as the president stepped out of his gleaming car.  He smiled warmly and waved to the crowd, between greeting various city and cathedral dignitaries.  It is a very proud day for Coventry, one that onlooker Bridget Connelly, originally from Galway, thought would never happen. \"It's fantastic. It was just a dream of mine. He was so warmly welcomed,\" she said. Her daughter, Patricia Southall, added: \"Diplomatically there must have been hard work to get here. I'm sure it'll do a lot of good in the future.\" Mr Higgins was later presented with The Complete Works of Shakespeare, signed by the acting company, and he gifted the RSC a copy of The Book of Kells. They then travelled to Coventry for a tour of its current cathedral and the ruins of the old building that was bombed during World War II. They also attended a reception for members of the Irish community at St Mary's Guildhall in the city. During his four-day tour, Mr Higgins met Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at Buckingham Palace. He also attended several events marking the contribution of the Irish community to public life in Britain.  They included business leaders, charity workers and NHS staff. On Thursday evening, the president attended a concert celebrating Irish music and culture at London's Royal Albert Hall.  At the event, Mr Higgins thanked the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh for their \"gracious welcome and warm hospitality\" throughout his UK trip.  He said the preparation they had made for his state visit was \"reflective of the true and deep friendship that now exists between Ireland and the United Kingdom\". ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he was not a \"career politician\" The leader of the Welsh Conservatives has told party members they must be open to a \"coalition of ideas\". Andrew RT Davies said the party - which has been in opposition since the Assembly was created in 1999 - needed to listen to ideas from outside. His words will be seen as a hint the party could be open to forming a coalition with other parties after the assembly elections in 2016. Mr Davies called the current Welsh Labour government \"lazy\" and \"tired\".  \"I believe Welsh Conservatives are mature enough to look at that coalition of ideas, to look where the best ideas can come from, and to date they've come from the Welsh Conservatives,\" he said during the second day of the Welsh Conservative conference in Llangollen. \"It means reaching out to anyone who has the best interests of the people of Wales at heart and wants to get us off the bottom of the league table whether it be in health, education or the economy, rather than this over-lording mentality Labour has.\" Over the last few months Mr Davies has faced difficult situations and in February he sacked four members of his shadow cabinet for rebelling against him in a vote on devolving income tax. He admitted there had been internal divisions within his party for years but in his speech on Saturday he called on members to have self belief.  \"We have hope, we have ambition and above all we have the hope and ambition for the country we seek to lead,\" he said. \"I want my team to keep believing that we can keep on making that difference and build that coalition of ideas that we need to put in place to solve the problems of Wales.\" On some measures, education in Wales is no better than in some of the eastern European nations emerging from decades of communism\u201d Earlier, Welsh Secretary David Jones accused the Labour-led Welsh government of letting down an entire generation of young people, due to a \"continuing decline in the education system\". Mr Jones has attacked Labour's record on education at the Welsh Conservative conference in Llangollen. It follows an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on the Welsh education system.  The report praised \"positive\" learning conditions but found many weaknesses. \"Wales lacks a compelling and inclusive long-term education vision to steer the education system and its reform efforts,\" Mr Jones said at the second day of the conference. The most recent Pisa international education tests, which are run by the OECD, ranked Wales bottom in the UK. The 2012 Pisa tests in science, maths and reading were taken by 500,000 15-year-olds in 68 countries. \"The Pisa statistics published recently were, frankly, shocking,\" Mr Jones added. \"They showed Wales to be the weakest of the home nations in maths, science and reading. \"On some measures, education in Wales is no better than in some of the eastern European nations emerging from decades of communism.\"  Mr Jones argued that good education is crucial in a wholly global economy and to compete in that market the young people of Wales needed an \"excellent education\". During the conference Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith spoke about his party's welfare reform.  \"I have fought so hard to create and introduce Universal Credit, now running in England, Scotland and Wales - in Shotton from 7 April - and set to roll out further across the north west,\" he said.  Universal Credit is replacing six benefits, including jobseeker's allowance, income support, child tax credit and housing benefit. He said the behavioural effect of the reform was \"striking\" and allowed more people to enter the workforce. \"Across the UK, there are now a lower proportion of workless households than at any time on record, down 450,000 since 2010, and down 23,000 in Wales,\" Mr Duncan Smith said. Addressing the conference on Friday, David Cameron attacked the Welsh government's handling of the NHS. He said Wales was witnessing a \"national scandal\" as Offa's Dyke \"has become the line between life and death\".  UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also launched his strongest attack on the NHS in Wales, claiming it is \"sleepwalking to a Mid Staffs tragedy\". He criticised Wales' record on waiting times and ambulance targets. ",

The reduction of the regiment's 340 personnel is expected to come from those in temporary posts, it said. The changes are expected to be in place by July 2015 at the latest. In July 2012, it was announced the regiment could be axed in plans to reduce the size of the army from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 personnel. But armed forces minister Mark Francois told MPs, in a written statement: \"At the time of the Army 2020 announcement, the army acknowledged that engagement with the Royal Navy was still ongoing, and this would refine the allocation of army manpower available to support Royal Navy tasks. \"This process is now complete and it has been decided that 24 Commando Engineer Regiment will be retained although the regiment will be reduced in size. \"This change will be achieved by rebalancing army manpower within 3 Commando Brigade and allows for the best use of available resources to deliver the strategic defence and security review and Army 2020 capability.\" The regiment was created in 2008 to support Plymouth-based 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and has been deployed twice to Afghanistan. North Devon Liberal Democrat MP Nick Harvey said the government had recognised \"how valuable the skills of regiments like 24 Royal Engineers are to the Royal Marines\". \"I look forward to seeing a smaller but no less important 24 Engineers Regiment playing an active role at the base once again,\" he said.

        "article": "Philip Atkins and Roger Lawrence are lifelong friends.  They first met as schoolboys at Denstone College in north Staffordshire, more years ago than either of them care to recall, and their very different career paths have eventually led them in remarkably similar directions. They both now lead large local authorities which find themselves the closest of collaborators on the most ambitious of projects -  Close to the border between our biggest shire county and one of our big city authorities is the Midlands' most ambitious economic regeneration venture. The i54 site extends over 226 acres. It's where cutting-edge manufacturers, including Moog and Jaguar Land Rover, are creating over 2,000 jobs - JLR alone is spending \u00a3500m on its giant engine factory there. At the heart of the initiative is a partnership between three local authorities: South Staffordshire is the district authority responsible not only for the planning of the site but also for the local business rates which will go into the i54 mix.  But ours is the story of the two councils who are co-funding the site in general, and in particular, the construction of a new junction 2 on the M54 motorway, due to open at the end of this year at a cost of \u00a338m.    Partners though councillors Atkins and Lawrence may be, they are also political polar opposites. As Staffordshire's Conservative leader, Mr Atkins has responded to year-after-year of budgetary austerity by embracing the process of merging and sharing services.  He says local government has a way to go yet in terms of working smarter and forging new partnerships like the ones he is working on with the police and healthcare agencies.  His is an upper-tier council which is responsible for strategic services like education, refuse disposal and highways. The authority is maintaining a freeze on council tax. Labour-controlled Wolverhampton, by contrast, is increasing its council tax by just under the 2% that would otherwise have triggered a referendum. It is one of the councils parodied by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles as \"democracy dodgers\".  Leader Roger Lawrence points out that his authority faces a vastly heavier burden supporting concentrations of the weakest and poorest in the community than more affluent areas like Staffordshire; and that they also have proportionately less revenue-raising potential.  He was recently forced to announce 2,000 council jobs losses as part of \u00a3123m savings over five years. No wonder the two councils display such contrasting philosophies. Mr Atkins sees the evolution of local government as a continuing process, Mr Lawrence makes clear that in an ideal world [which for him includes a Labour government] he would hope to reverse at least some of the austerity measures he himself has introduced. Local library opening hours have been reduced to 24 a week but it would obviously be a relatively straightforward matter to restore full-time opening when and if the council's budgets allow.  I was delighted when councillors Atkins and Lawrence accepted my invitation to meet me at i54 to air their differences and consider the way forward.  What followed was a stimulating and thought-provoking conversation which you will be able to see for yourself. It will be one of our main talking points in this weekend's Sunday Politics Midlands. The council leaders were brave enough to join me. I hope you will be too. ",

        "article": "It was like a Game of Thrones moment. But rather than a warning of the dread dark winter, this had a real political touch: \"Devolution is coming.\" The Ned Stark character on this occasion was the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Labour's Alan Rhodes. \"I welcome greater devolution,\" he told me. \"Undoubtedly, we can find local solutions to local issues in a much more effective way than Whitehall ever could.\" Unlike Ned Stark, Alan Rhodes won't lose his political head over this. But his next comments might stir things up. \"We need more tax-raising powers and planning ought to be left entirely to local government. Whether it's education or social care, we know what our local needs are.\" So why is devolution for England being scripted on the political agenda?  Back to a Game of Thrones plot line: politicians in England are already looking beyond The Wall -Hadrian's Wall - and weighing up options should the Scots vote for independence. Whatever the result, local government leaders in England expect any new constitutional settlement to beef up regions again. Lord Heseltine kicked the ball rolling in his 2012 report - No Stone Unturned - on giving so-called city regions more economic clout. \"Besides neutering local leadership, the monopoly of Whitehall is dysfunctional on two counts,\" he said. \"First, too many decisions are taken in London without a real understanding of the particular, and differing, circumstances of the communities affected. \"And second, with responsibilities divided up between policy departments, no-one in government is tasked to look holistically at the full range of issues facing a particular area.\" The Labour leader Ed Miliband warmed to the English devolution theme in a significant speech in Birmingham.  He also wants more powers for our big cities. He proposed creating a minister for each English region, acting as a bridge between Whitehall and the region. If it sounds familiar, then it is. During the last Labour government, the East Midlands had its own regional minister. Remember Phil Hope and Gillian Merron? The coalition scrapped Labour's regional apparatus and replaced it all with more localised business-political organisations, the Local Enterprise Partnerships, to steer economic regeneration. \"Michael Heseltine's review called for a massive devolution of funding from Whitehall to the cities,\" the Labour leader told his Birmingham audience. \"But David Cameron and George Osborne allocated just \u00a32bn. The best report this government has produced has been the one they have most ignored. We can and must do a lot better than that.\" What is uncertain in all this is whether devolution to city regions, like greater Nottingham, is welcomed by the Treasury or whether this idea will be squashed once the Treasury takes fright at losing power over the purse-strings. As the Stark family learnt the hard way in Game of Thrones, trying to win control over a southern-based political power block may not have a happy ending. ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. In full: Prime Minister David Cameron's speech on Europe David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech ( ) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to \"bring back\" powers to Westminster from Brussels.  For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are   from the speech. The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be \"brought back\" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: \"We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK.\" The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.  David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: \"Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest?  I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market.\" Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a \"chilling effect\" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it \"game, set and match\" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.  The BBC has compiled  . Here is a round-up of  . The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off \"leaving gracefully\". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said \"cherry picking is not an option\". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said:  \"We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'.\" Read  . A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU.  The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said \"closer union of the eurozone is not for us\" but Mr Cameron \"rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU\".

Attempted to shake-off his \"Red Ed\" tag by talking about the \"squeezed middle\" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on \"refounding\" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.

        "article": "Every single-issue campaign group or minority starts with a dream. A dream to one day be in the position to achieve what it sets out to do. Many fall by the wayside, but the Scottish National Party - which formed 80 years ago this month - is one of the exceptions. It's taken a while to get there, but, despite the party's turbulent history, it will stage a referendum on Scottish independence on 18 September, after winning two historic terms in office. The story of the SNP is one of success and failure, highs and lows, rogues and visionaries - but, most of all, it's the story of a party which started life on the fringes and became a mainstream force. The modern case for Scottish home rule goes right back to its unification with England in 1707. The view that the Scots who put their names to the Act of Union had been bribed, famously spurred Robert Burns to later write: \"We are bought and sold for English gold. Such a parcel of rogues in a nation.\" Fast forward many years and those fighting for Scottish autonomy concluded that a pro-independence, election-fighting party was the way to go. And so on Saturday 7 April 1934 at Glasgow's St Andrew's Hall, the Scottish National Party - an amalgamation of the Scottish Party and the National Party of Scotland - was formally inaugurated. But for years the SNP struggled to make an impact, partly due to the ongoing debate between those who wanted to concentrate on outright independence - the fundamentalists - and those who wanted to achieve it through policies such as devolution - the gradualists. The young party's other problem was that, put simply, it just wasn't any good at fighting elections, because of its lack of funding, organisation and policies beyond independence. In its first test, the 1935 General Election, the SNP contested eight seats and won none. It was not until a decade later, at the Motherwell and Wishaw by-election, when the party finally got a break. When the contest was announced following the death of sitting Labour MP James Walker, the nationalists sent in one of their up-and-comers, Robert McIntyre. Standing largely on a platform of government failures in post-war reconstruction, the SNP took the seat with 50% of the vote, but lost it months later in the election. A lack of electoral impact forced the party to reorganise - a move which would help the SNP to an even more famous win. The 1967 Hamilton by-election should have been a breeze for Labour, but, as the party's vote collapsed, the SNP's Winnie Ewing romped home on 46%, declaring: \"Stop the world, Scotland wants to get on.\" The 1970s was the decade of boom and bust for the SNP. They failed to hang on in Hamilton, but 1970 brought the SNP its first UK election gain, in the Western Isles. That same decade also saw the beginnings of the party's \"It's Scotland's Oil\" strategy, which sought to demonstrate Scotland was seeing little direct benefit of the tax wealth brought by North Sea oil and gas. More success followed in 1973, when Margo MacDonald won the Glasgow Govan by-election and, the following year, an under-fire Tory government called an election, which it lost. The SNP gained six seats and retained the Western Isles, but lost Govan. With Labour in power as a minority government, the party had little choice but to call a second election in 1974 - but not before committing support for a Scottish Assembly. Even so, the SNP gained a further four seats, hitting its all time Westminster high of 11. The party's turn of fortunes was largely down to its visionary leader-of-the-day, Billy Wolfe. Despite the success, tensions began to develop between those in the SNP who were elected and those who were not. Then came 1979 - the year which provided two serious blows to the SNP. Margaret Thatcher's Tories swept to power, and a referendum for a devolved Scottish Assembly resulted in a \"No\" vote. To be more precise, a requirement that 40% of the total Scottish electorate had to vote \"Yes\" for the 1979 referendum to become law, was not met. With the constitutional issue off the table, the SNP came under a period of heavy fire from rivals, portrayed by Labour as the \"Tartan Tories\" and irrelevant \"Separatists\" by the Conservatives. With a post-election SNP slashed back to two MPs, the party needed a serious jump-start - but that jump-start dragged the party into a period which could have finished it off for good. The start of the 80s was a torrid time for the SNP when deep divisions gave rise to two notorious splinter groups. One was the ultra-nationalist organisation Siol Nan Gaidheal - branded \"proto fascists\" by the then SNP leader Gordon Wilson. The other was the Interim Committee for Political Discussion - more infamously known as the '79 Group, formed to sharpen the party's message and appeal to dissident Labour voters. But the party leadership was unimpressed, and when a leak of '79 Group minutes to the media raised the prospect of links with the Provisional Sinn Fein - despite claims the leaked version was inaccurate - Mr Wilson had had enough. His view that the party had to unite or die led to a ban on organised groups, but when the '79 Group refused to go quietly, several members were briefly expelled from the party. They included Scotland's future justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill, and one Alex Salmond. The 1987 election saw another bad SNP performance, emerging with only three seats. But, towards the end of the decade, were things looking up? Former Labour MP Jim Sillars, who defected to the SNP in the early 80s before becoming the architect of its independence in Europe policy, re-took Glasgow Govan for the SNP in a 1988 by-election - repeating the success of wife, Ms McDonald, more than a decade earlier. And a collapse in the Conservative vote in 1987 meant the constitutional issue was back. Now the party needed new blood at the top to take it forward into the next decade. Few people have done more to aid the success of the SNP than Alex Salmond. Despite previous form with the '79 Group, Mr Salmond had risen through the SNP ranks, becoming MP for Banff and Buchan in 1987. He did not have his work to seek on becoming leader in 1990. As well as having to deal with on-going internal issues over the party's independence policy - future minister Alex Neil had declared Scotland would be \"free by '93\" - there was an election to fight. In 1992, the SNP increased its vote, but the party was only able to retain the three seats it already had, and lost Govan. Mr Salmond moved to modernise the SNP to be more socially democratic and pro-European. For the SNP, the best it could manage in the first devolved election of 1999 was to become the main opposition to the Labour-Lib Dem coalition government. Then came Mr Salmond's surprising decision to quit as SNP leader, and as an MSP. His successor in 2000 was John Swinney, but, despite being among the party's brightest talent, the future Scottish finance secretary's four-year tenure was plagued by dissenters from within. The party dropped a seat in the 2001 UK election, and, despite a slick campaign in the 2003 Holyrood polls, the SNP once again ended up the opposition. Later that year, a little-known SNP activist called Bill Wilson challenged Mr Swinney for the leadership, accusing him of ducking responsibility for a \"plummeting\" SNP vote. Mr Swinney won a decisive victory, discarding his usual measured oratory during a hustings to declare his goal was \"to tell the Brits to get off\". If nominated I'll decline. If drafted I'll defer. And if elected I'll resign\u201d I changed my mind\u201d But he was left weakened, and, at Holyrood, SNP MSPs Bruce McFee and Adam Ingram declared they would not support Mr Swinney in a leadership ballot. Another, nationalist MSP, Campbell Martin, was flung out of the party after bosses found his criticism of the Swinney leadership damaged its interests in the run-up to the SNP's poor European election showing in 2004, where it failed to overtake Labour. Mr Swinney quit as leader, accepting responsibility for failing to sell the party's message - but warned SNP members over the damage caused by \"the loose and dangerous talk of the few\". When the leaderless party turned to Mr Salmond, he responded by borrowing from Union Army General William Sherman, who, on being asked to run for president following the American Civil War, declared: \"If nominated I'll decline. If drafted I'll defer. And if elected I'll resign.\" But ever full of surprises, Mr Salmond entered the leadership race, \"with a degree of surprise and humility, but with a renewed determination\". Essentially, as he put it himself: \"I changed my mind.\"  Nobody thought the 2007 Scottish election result could be so close. In the end, the SNP won the election by one seat, while Mr Salmond returned to Holyrood as MSP for Gordon. With the SNP's pro-independence stance ruling out a coalition with one of the other big parties, the party forged ahead as a minority government. The SNP government had promised to seek consensus on an issue-by-issue basis, but when the opposition parties thought ministers were being disingenuous, they converged to reject the Scottish budget in 2009. It was passed on the second attempt, but served as a reminder to the SNP the delicate position it was in. Other key manifesto commitments also ran into trouble - plans to replace council tax with local income tax were dropped due to lack of support, while ambitious plans to cut class sizes in the early primary school years ran into problems. Eventually, the bill on an independence referendum was ditched. Although the SNP's focus had become the Scottish government, it was keen not to lose sight of its status beyond the Holyrood bubble and, in 2009, won the largest share of the Scottish vote in the European election for the first time. Continuing its knack for winning safe Labour seats in by-elections, the SNP delivered a crushing blow to Labour, winning Glasgow East by overturning a majority of 13,507 to win by just a few hundred votes. The SNP went into the 2011 election campaign with Labour leading in the polls, but the party failed to repeat this success a few months later in the Glenrothes by-election and, later, in Glasgow North East. In a story that bore echoes of the past for the SNP, the 2010 UK election saw Labour regain Glasgow East. The 2011 Holyrood election was seen by some as Labour's to lose. In the event, that's exactly what happened. Despite polls predicting a Labour lead over the SNP of up to 15 points, the nationalists threw themselves into the campaign. They said their positive campaign, versus Labour's negativity, was what won it for them. The SNP's 2007 win was rightly described as a historic one - but, four years later, the party re-wrote the history books. The part-PR/part-constituency system at Holyrood was essentially designed to keep any one party (ie, the SNP) from winning an overall majority. Scotland's first majority government named the date for the referendum as 18 September 2014, and launched its prospectus for the future in a White Paper. But before all that, there was one big hurdle to clear. The SNP's opposition to all things nuclear has always been as fundamental as its support for independence itself. For many years it opposed membership of Nato, characterising the security alliance as one with a \"first-strike\" nuclear policy. SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said a fresh approach was needed ahead of the referendum - although part of the argument for Nato within the SNP rested on a pragmatic calculation that most voters favoured membership. And so, at the party's 2012 conference, members voted to end the decades-old opposition to Nato membership. But the decision didn't come without cost, and after a heated debate which invoked memories of SNP conferences past, two MSPs - Jean Urquhart and John Finnie - quit the party. But it seemed the party managed to move on from the episode, and today, the SNP, with its 25,000-strong membership, has truly come a long way since the fringes of 1934. But it now faces what could be a make-or-break challenge. Labour veteran George Robertson famously quipped devolution would \"kill nationalism stone dead\". But, with the SNP claiming rising support for a \"Yes\" vote, could the situation now be more akin to comments by another Labour stalwart, Tam Dalyell, who described devolution as \"a motorway to independence with no U-turns and no exits?\" It's a question which will not only define the future of Britain, but the future of the Scottish National Party.

        "article": "On a kibbutz outside Jerusalem Ed Miliband was greeted with a loud, warm Jewish embrace from 84-year-old Sara - his mother's cousin - who, like her, is a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust. It marked the end of a visit to Israel that has been as much about the personal as the political - a chance for the Labour leader to connect with his past as well as to talk about the future of the Middle East.  At the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial he was handed a book - the record of the lives and deaths at the hands of the Nazis of his relatives. He gulped and his wife Justine fought to hold back tears when they discovered that his grandfather had apparently died, not in Auschwitz - as they'd always thought - but in another concentration camp.  I want to be the post-Iraq prime minister and that means learning the lessons of Iraq\u201d I spoke to him about what the experience meant to him. \"It was quite an emotional visit for you to the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem. Did it bring you close to the losses your family suffered as a result of the Nazis?\"  \"It was sort of awful if I am honest. It is awful because you see the suffering. \"It would be awful for anyone because you see the suffering, but it was particularly, incredibly painful for me. \"They presented me at the end a document - which I have got here - about my family history and about my grandfather, who I never met who died in one of the camps. \"I feel such a long way away from that family history in a sense, because I have led such a secure upbringing from a very stable family, but both my parents were refugees. \"Large numbers of their relatives - including my mum's dad - lost his life in the Holocaust and so it is part of who I am, but a long way away, and then to come so close to it is incredibly painful.\" \"For those people who don't have those family roots, just try and capture what it means. You are not a religious man, it is not a religious thing that you are talking about, so what is it and how does it affect a potential prime minister?\"  \"There will be people who have lost relatives in very sad circumstances and so that is where it starts. \"But then it's about people whose lives have been broken, been dislocated, been sent hither all over the world. \"My dad [came] as a refugee to London in 1940, my mum [found] her way there after the Second World War. \"I think if I can say in a strange way that the only positive there is... having seen that broken world and broken families, I think it made them give me an upbringing which said 'don't waste a life, don't waste a single life'. \"So many lives have been wasted and destroyed, they never said that to me, so that is what is odd about it. \"They never said 'our family has a Holocaust history so you better work hard and do your homework', but they inculcated in me a sense of 'you have got to try and repair a broken world'. \"So that is - I won't say a positive - but that is some of the impact that it had on me.\" Just how broken the Middle East is, Mr Miliband saw on the top of a hill just above the Gaza Strip. He and his wife Justine were shown where the rockets are fired which rain down on this Israeli town of Sderot. They visited a playgroup which looks like many you would see in the UK, until you realise the kids are playing inside instead of outside as they would not be safe under the deep blue sky and are only so under a roof of reinforced concrete. On a visit to the West Bank on Saturday he will hear of Palestinian suffering.  Ed Miliband now talks often of his Jewish heritage (though not faith because he is an atheist) but he has never been a cheer leader for Israel. He's reluctant to call himself a Zionist. In his first speech to his party conference after being elected Labour leader in 2010, he urged Israel to recognise in deed as well as word the Palestinians' desire for statehood.  I asked him to spell out what sort of foreign policy a Prime Minister Miliband would pursue.  \"I want to be the post-Iraq prime minister and that means learning the lessons of Iraq. \"It does mean a Britain engaged with the rest of the world, and willing on occasion in the right circumstances to play its part militarily, of course to defend itself, but also for other purposes. \"But with clear tests - that military intervention can only be justified as a last resort and if there is a clear and compelling case for making that intervention, if there is international support and there is a proper prospect of success. \"If you look at the decisions I have made as leader of the opposition on Libya, where I supported intervention, or on Syria where I opposed it, I think I have been consistent with those principles and they are principles that I would apply in government.\" This visit is Mr Miliband's first major international trip apart from three visits to Afghanistan. He has not visited the White House, Beijing, Delhi or Berlin as leader of the opposition. \"I will make other visits,\" he told me - but I put it to him that this underlined a problem many people thought he had.   Media requires JavaScript to play. On Thursday Ed Miliband laid a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem  \"In little under a year's time you may be moving into 10 Downing Street. Do you accept that the British public don't yet see you as a prime minister, they can't yet envisage it? \"I think it is maybe always the case with leaders of the opposition. \"I have been doing this job for three-and-a-half years and I think in the past that people have maybe underestimated me. \"I am looking forward to the next 12 months. I think it is a big fight for the future of the country.\"  \"You think you have always been underestimated?\" I want big change in the country, people yearn for big change\u201d \"You always get your critics as leader of the opposition and I think people have tried to write us off before, but I am pretty confident and optimistic about the next election. \"I think there is a big fight for the future of Britain and about what kind of country we want to be like.\" Back home, Mr Miliband has been under pressure not to play it cautious in his approach to the next election and to be true to himself as the man who became Labour leader because he represented a rejection of his party's recent past.  \"There are some who accuse you of being simply too cautious as you are running for the election. I sense there is a kind of radical trapped in there, you want to see yourself as another Attlee or Thatcher, is that right?\" \"Look -  freeze energy prices, break up the banks, other things I have said, change the way our economy works, I don't think we are cautious. \"We are not going to win this election by being cautious - we are going to win it by being bold and by being clear about how we are going to change the country. \"It is absolutely the person that I am, that is why I ran for the leadership. \"I ran for the leadership in difficult circumstances, everybody knows. I ran against my brother. \"Why did I do it? Because I felt I had something to say about how we change the country. \"That's why I am in this, that's what I want to prove over the next 12 months.\"  \"An energy freeze may be a good idea or a bad idea, no one will write about it in 100 years' time. They will write about what Attlee did, they will write about what Thatcher did. Are you saying you may not want to lay it all out yet, that this is a radical offer of a transformation of the way that Britain is?\"  \"I think that I can substantially change the way our country works, because I think the central problem that we face - that countries around the world are going to face - in the coming years is: are you increasingly unequal, are you increasingly unjust, just working for a few people at the top of our society? \"That requires big change not small change. \"Whether it was on energy - where I was massively criticised for the boldness of it - or on the banks or on other areas, we are going to make that change happen so our country truly works for people.\"  \"But more than once I have seen you praise Margaret Thatcher. Not for her ideas or her policies but as a person who brought about change.\"  \"I know where you are trying to tempt me towards. \"I think these comparisons with other historical figures have their limitations. \"I am going to be my own person and I am going to change the country in my own way. \"But if you are asking me if we need big change not small change? The answer is yes.\"  \"You know what I am asking you. Are you going to be Labour's Margaret Thatcher?\"  \"Well no you don't make those comparisons. I want big change in the country, people yearn for big change.\" \"If a commentator called you Labour's Margaret Thatcher then you wouldn't much mind?\"  \"Well you can call me a radical. That's what I want to be. That is the kind of prime minister that I want to be.\" ",

        "article": "Politicians are often described, somewhat optimistically, as popular figures in Parliament, but in the case of Nigel Evans it is true. There was profound shock on all sides when the allegations of sexual offences against the then deputy Speaker first surfaced - and no shortage of MPs and peers willing to speak up for him. \"Nigel Evans is a hugely popular figure, a very gregarious figure,\" said Cardiff North MP Jonathan Evans, at the time. \"He is friends, really, with everybody. Very unusually in politics, he is warmly regarded by all parties.\" Among those offering character references, which were read out in court during his trial, were Labour MP Glenda Jackson, who described him as \"courteous, humorous and respectful of opinions\" and a \"hard-working backbencher\".  Labour's Ann Clwyd described him as \"naturally sociable\" and \"invaluable\" when dealing with foreign politicians as part of their roles on various committees.  Conservative MP Eleanor Laing, who won the election to replace him as deputy Speaker, said he was a \"well-respected, popular member of the House\", who was \"kind and thoughtful\" and \"known to be a gentle person\". Former MP Ann Widdecombe described him as a \"truthful, considerate and kind individual,\" adding that \"such qualities at Westminster are not universal\". There were similarly fulsome tributes from colleagues on Twitter when news of his acquittal broke. \"So pleased for my friend Nigel Evans today. A good man. Horrid experience to go through,\"   Pembrokeshire. \"Nigel Evans was an excellent Deputy Speaker and a lovely man. So pleased  he has been found not guilty,\"  . Mr Evans, 55, who resigned the Conservative whip and sat as an independent MP in the run-up to his trial, had earned his position in public life the hard way. The son of a Swansea newsagent, he liked to say it was \"God's little joke\" that he had been born a Conservative in south Wales, a Labour heartland. After joining the party at the age of 17, he got himself elected as a county councillor in his 20s and, by his early 30s had made two attempts to get into Parliament for Welsh seats. He finally achieved his ambition in 1992, in the Lancashire seat of Ribble Valley, after losing out to the Liberal Democrats at a by-election in the seat a year earlier.  He kept his links with Swansea, thanks to the family business, founded by his father. John Major appointed him the Conservative spokesman for Wales after the party's 1997 election defeat and, in 2001, he was made shadow Wales secretary by Iain Duncan Smith. He resigned from the post in 2003 when Michael Howard took up the leadership and decided not to include a Welsh affairs spokesman in his top team - a move criticised by Evans. At the time he said he had been offered the chance to carry on as Welsh affairs spokesman outside the cabinet, but had decided to return to the back benches instead. At the 2010 general election he retained his seat with a majority of more than 14,700 over his second-placed Labour rival. He abandoned any frontbench ambitions and decided instead to seek the non-partisan role of deputy Speaker, one of the most coveted in the Commons.  He was elected to serve as one of John Bercow's three deputies, who take it in turns to stand in for the Speaker, keeping MPs in order and selecting who gets to to speak in debates. It was the first time those roles had been chosen by a ballot of MPs and Mr Evans won more votes than the other two contenders. Mr Bercow described him as someone with a sense of humour, who knew the parliamentary rules and was \"quick on his feet\". He won further admiration from colleagues when, a few months after his election, he announced he was gay, saying he was tired of \"living a lie\". Launching a parliamentary group to help MPs be open about their sexuality, Mr Evans said he had been threatened with exposure by a former MP before deciding to come out as gay. \"With my background in south Wales, it was hard enough being a Tory, let alone being gay,\" he told the Mail on Sunday.  \"It wasn't so much 'the only gay in the village' as 'the only Tory in Swansea'.\" Mr Evans went to Dynevor School and to the city's university, where he graduated in politics, and was elected to the now-defunct West Glamorgan County Council in 1985. He became deputy leader of the council's Conservative group and remained a councillor until 1991, during which time he had already fought parliamentary elections in Swansea West and Pontypridd. The esteem in which Mr Evans was held by his colleagues at Westminster was never more evident than when his boss, John Bercow, allowed him to make a personal statement to the House, when he stood down as deputy Speaker to fight the allegations. His voice cracking with emotion, he told MPs: \"This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life, alongside the loss of my mother in 2009, and the loss of my brother earlier this year. \"Winston Churchill said, 'When you are going through hell, keep going.' Sage advice.  \"And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people who mean so much to me.\" ",

        "article": "Maria Miller has resigned as culture secretary after being forced to repay \u00a35,800 in mortgage payments she over-claimed on her parliamentary expenses. These happened before the rules changed, but could it happen again with another MP? MPs have a divided work life, having to spend time both at Westminster and in their constituencies. This has long been recognised in the expenses system. Until 2010 all MPs - except those with seats in inner London - could claim up to \u00a324,000 a year towards buying, furnishing and renovating a second home.  This could include mortgage interest payments, meaning that increases in the values of properties (usually in London) were effectively being subsidised. After the 2009 expenses scandal broke, abuses of the system and apparent use of taxpayers' money to boost MPs' property portfolios and personal wealth led to demands for change. The rules were overhauled, starting after the 2010 general election for new MPs. Returning MPs were given a transitional period, lasting until 2012. Under the new system, MPs were allowed to claim a maximum of \u00a31,450 a month to rent - not buy - a second home. Mortgage assistance was thrown out. Also, the number of MPs allowed to claim any help with accommodation was reduced. All those who have constituencies within 20 miles - or 60 minutes - of central London are now banned from getting rent subsidies. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) was not given any retrospective powers to reclaim profits made on homes prior to 2010 for taxpayers. However, it was allowed to do so for the pre-2010 MPs who continued to claim mortgage interest payments from the 2010 election until 2012. IPSA ordered those who did so to have their second homes valued by a chartered surveyor at the beginning and the end of the period. If they had gone up in price, they had to repay up to 100% of the increase, depending on what portion of the mortgage interest had been funded by the taxpayer. There may still be MPs who overclaimed on their mortgages under the old system. House of Commons Leader Andrew Lansley has said as much. As time passes, the number affected is likely to dwindle, with the newer MPs unaffected by the previous system. But it is difficult to rule out another situation like Mrs Miller's. And mortgage expense claims will continue to be scrutinised. ",

        "article": "Millions of people are voting in the European election and local council polls in England and Northern Ireland on Thursday. It is the final big test of public opinion before 2015's general election. All 73 UK seats in the European Parliament - the EU's only directly elected body - are up for grabs, along with 4,216 seats on local councils, nearly half of them in London.  Polling stations are open for voting between 07:00 and 22:00 BST. The last European elections took place in 2009. Voting will take place in the EU's other 27 member states over the next four days, with 751 MEPs in total being chosen. Thursday sees voting take place in the Netherlands. In England, a third of seats are being contested on dozens of district and unitary authorities and in the 36 Metropolitan Boroughs, including Tyne and Wear, Greater Manchester, South and West Yorkshire, Merseyside and the West Midlands. In London, every seat on all 32 London boroughs is up for election - the first time this has happened since the day of the 2010 general election.  Voters will also choose mayors in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford. In Northern Ireland, voters will elect 462 representatives to 11 so-called \"super districts\" following a reorganisation that took place in 2012, reducing the number of councils from 26 previously.  There are no local elections in either Scotland or Wales.  The weather forecast suggests that some people could have a very wet trip to the polling booths, with a Met Office weather warning covering Wales and southern England for heavy rain and possible localised flooding in areas hit by slow moving thundery downpours.

Home secretary Theresa May: \"Show the public you get it\" Theresa May has urged the Police Federation of England and Wales to reform, or she will enforce change. The home secretary made the demand as she told the federation its public funding would be withdrawn from August.  A motion for reform was passed at the federation's annual conference after Mrs May's speech.   Outgoing chairman Steve Williams told the BBC the federation would \"work hard\" to make sure the reforms were carried out. The organisation, which represents 126,000 rank and file officers, has faced accusations of bullying and a lack of transparency in its accounts.  Addressing the conference in Bournemouth, Mrs May said the organisation had to change \"from top to bottom\". BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Mrs May's fifth speech to the federation as home secretary was \"by far the most uncompromising\", leaving members shocked. It was met with silence from the audience. Government funding had already been reduced from \u00a3320,000 to \u00a3190,000 a year, the home secretary said, adding that the federation had built up \"vast reserves\" of cash. \"Show the public that you get it, that you want to take responsibility for the future of policing and you want to work with me to change policing for the better,\" said Mrs May.  She also announced the Home Office would use its powers to inspect the federation's accounts, and announced that she would be bringing forward proposals to make the organisation subject to the Freedom of Information Act. And she said officers would no longer automatically become members of the federation, instead having to opt in.   The money previously spent on the federation will instead be spent on a new scheme called Police First, aimed at attracting university graduates, she added.  The federation has been subject to allegations of widespread bullying and intimidation among its leadership, and was criticised for the way it handled the \"plebgate\" affair, which led to the resignation of former government chief whip Andrew Mitchell. In her  , Mrs May urged the federation to adopt changes recommended by the former top civil servant at the Home Office, Sir David Normington, who called for federation branches to disclose what money was held in secondary bank accounts. She said: \"Make no mistake. If you do not make significant progress towards the implementation of the Normington reforms, if the federation does not start to turn itself around, you must not be under the impression that the government will let things remain as they are. \"The federation was created by an act of Parliament and it can be reformed by an act of Parliament. \"If you do not change of your own accord, we will impose change on you.\"  Referring to \"plebgate\" and the findings of the review into the Hillsborough disaster, Mrs May said it was \"not enough to mouth platitudes about a few bad apples\" in the face of scandals.  Mr Williams, whose successor is set to be chosen on Friday, said of the emergency motion: \"I'm extremely proud of what's taken place today. We've made history today within the Police Federation.   \"And my colleagues have made the right decision in relation to embracing the reforms that are required.\"  He added that he was retiring as \"a very proud man and a very proud policeman\".  Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: \"What the home secretary has done is go beyond the Normington review and indeed beyond our recommendations.\"   Sir David congratulated the federation for \"having the courage of its convictions in order to vote through the entire package of reform that we proposed\". He said: \"The organisation now has a real opportunity to recreate the professional, trusted, and unified Police Federation which its members so badly want, and once again become the trusted voice of frontline officers. \"We expect the package of reform to take at least two years to implement - but this is a good beginning.  \"I hope it is the start of a process by which the Federation regains the trust of its members and becomes open and accountable whilst adopting the standards of behaviour which the public expects.\" However in response to Mrs May's speech, Ian Hanson, chairman of the federation's Greater Manchester branch, said it had been a \"vitriolic attack not only on the Police Federation but on every police officer in the country\". \"Much has been said about professionalism and standards of behaviour in recent times. Today Mrs May went too far and should apologise,\" he added.  ",

Food sales during the late Easter holiday made a significant contribution to the overall figure, the ONS said. They were 6.3% higher in April against a year earlier, and 3.6% up on March.  Non-food sales rose by 6.5% compared with a year earlier, but were down 0.4% on the month.  The annual rise in food sales was the biggest since January 2002, and were helped by a combination of better weather and sales promotions. Increases in the price of food were limited to 0.9% in April, compared with 1.8% a month earlier.   Quarterly retail sales have now grown for 14 months in a row, the ONS added. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, described the latest set of figures as \"mightily impressive\", adding \"this bodes very well for GDP growth in the second quarter\". He said: \"The fundamentals for consumers are currently improving overall, and they should continue to do so over the coming months as employment rises further and earnings growth likely trends higher than inflation, thereby lifting purchasing power. \"The strong housing market is also supportive to retail sales.\"  And Ian Geddes, UK head of retail at Deloitte, said: \"It is encouraging to finally see some strong figures in the food sector, as this remains a challenging market for the large grocers who are vigorously responding to consumers' changing retail habits and, are currently implementing significant structural reorganisation.  \"This is clearly a long race and the large grocers are repositioning themselves to win over customers in the new, more complex era of multichannel retailing.\" The retail figures come a day after official figures showed inflation increased to 1.8% in April, up from a four year low of 1.6% in March.  Meanwhile, the latest set of figures for average wage growth showed earnings grew by 1.7% in the year to March.  ",

John McCallister used the words in a   interview after his party's decision on Tuesday to switch designation from \"unionist\" to \"other\". It comes just two days before European and local government elections.  Mr McCrea said  it was disappointing that Mr McCallister made his disagreement \"in a very public way\". \"There is some discomfort in the way that was done,\" Mr McCrea told BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show on Wednesday. \"I do think there is an explanation that is owed to me - not just me but to other people - it was something of a surprise in the way that we heard things.\" If they thought the publicity would be a good thing just before elections, that, fundamentally, seems to have backfired.  They are moving into Alliance territory even though they say they are pro-union. Given that John McCallister represents half of the Assembly party, it is in a bit of a meltdown this morning.  They seem to have struggled with this. It is a fundamental decision to make. NI21 was set up by MLAs Mr McCrea and Mr McCallister, after they quit the Ulster Unionist Party in 2013. On Tuesday, the decision to change designation was announced, in response, the party said, to the message they had been receiving from people while canvassing.  But Mr McCallister told the News Letter the move put NI21 \"right into no man's land with the Alliance Party\". He said he had not been consulted in advance and had been called at short notice to a meeting on Tuesday. \"I was literally told to come down from my constituency to Belfast to do it, with no idea what it was about,\" he told the News Letter. He said that the meeting consisted of a \"15 or 20-minute discussion with everyone keen to get back out canvassing\". He voted against the change.  Media requires JavaScript to play. In an interview with the News Letter, John McCallister said the decision to change its designation warranted a wider discussion  However, Mr McCrea defended the move, saying labels from the past were inconsistent with NI21's message. \"It is not John and I - the executive takes the decision. The party has developed into a political movement which attracts huge numbers...The party is bigger than either individual,\" he said. \"It is not about individuals or what they think about, it is what the party collectively thinks.\" Mr McCrea said the NI21 executive would have a discussion with Mr McAllister about his comments. Messages posted on social media by party activists suggested a split in grassroots opinion about the move.  A post on the NI21 Youth Twitter account said \"the lack of respect shown towards our deputy leader was disgusting, and we fully support John McCallister\".  However, the tweet was later removed, and a later message said it was made by someone with access to the account but not approved by the Queen's University Belfast NI21 society.  \"While the message was perceived as aggressive, we do support its fundamental message,\" it added.

        "article": "This has to be one of the more ironic disclosures I have received in response to a Freedom of Information request. It is a document that was never used. It was prepared by the civil service in case the 1992 general election resulted in a Labour victory and Neil Kinnock became prime minister. This is the front page of a set of procedural guidelines that would have been distributed to his ministerial team under his name, if his government had ever been formed - it has the initials NK at the bottom. It is one of a number of official papers prepared for the possibility of a Kinnock premiership, which I have been   under freedom of information. The Cabinet Office turned down my request for them, the Information Commissioner   this refusal for the bulk of the material, but instructed the Cabinet Office to release this particular document.  Each incoming prime minister has issued procedural guidance to ministerial colleagues since Clement Attlee in 1945. A version was first publicly disclosed in 1996, by the man who beat Lord Kinnock, Sir John Major. It is now routinely published today as the  . But the intriguing feature of the Kinnock version is point two, where the draft says he will publish this guidance note \"in accordance with our policy on freedom of information\".  In 1992 Labour   to introduce a Freedom of Information Act, and the officials who drafted this document were clearly anticipating that policy. Given that the Cabinet Office was preparing to release this paper in 1992 in line with a predicted Freedom of Information law, it seems puzzling and ironic that - despite a real FOI law now existing - it refused to disclose it over 20 years later until ordered to do so by the Information Commissioner. As for the other documents prepared for Neil Kinnock in 1992, the BBC is appealing the case to the Information Rights Tribunal. The government   that releasing them would encourage officials to write future briefings that are \"excessively detailed\" and \"verbose\". ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. In full: Prime Minister David Cameron's speech on Europe David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech ( ) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to \"bring back\" powers to Westminster from Brussels.  For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are   from the speech. The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be \"brought back\" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: \"We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK.\" The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.  David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: \"Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest?  I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market.\" Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a \"chilling effect\" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it \"game, set and match\" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.  The BBC has compiled  . Here is a round-up of  . The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off \"leaving gracefully\". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said \"cherry picking is not an option\". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said:  \"We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'.\" Read  . A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU.  The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said \"closer union of the eurozone is not for us\" but Mr Cameron \"rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU\".

        "article": "The Nottinghamshire market town of Newark is no stranger to hand-to-hand political battles. King John died in its walled castle. Was it a political killing? In the Civil War, the Royalists came a cropper at the hands of the parliamentarians. Now the town is about to face another siege: this time from teams of party canvassers, election campaigners and political journalists.  And then there's the list of candidates wanting to become the next MP for Newark. The by-election was caused by the   Patrick Mercer, over a cash-for-parliamentary-questions scandal. The by-election is on 5 June, but the Conservatives have hit the ground running.   The local party selected a new candidate last November, the moment Patrick Mercer resigned the Tory whip. He remained in the Commons as an independent MP.   The party's pinning its hopes on Robert Jenrick, until recently a director with Christie auctioneers. But could Newark's 16,000 Conservative majority end up going, going, gone? The national attention of a parliamentary by-election and the scrutiny of the main candidates involved can be a mixed blessing. \"There will be national interest,\" Mr Jenrick told me. \"What most people in the town want is a long-term constituency MP, who'll be a real champion for the area.  \"Also, someone who's going to live here with the family, make a life here and follow in the tradition of other Nottinghamshire MPs, like Patrick and Ken Clarke in Rushcliffe.\" He highlights local issues such as improving Newark's schools and the town's hospital. But in most by-elections, the outcome is viewed as a verdict on the performance of the party in government.  For the Conservatives, there's also the UKIP factor.   in this election but UKIP's candidate Roger Helmer will cause some nerves. He's an East Midlands MEP and a former Conservative, who defected two years ago to UKIP.  He had rowed with the Tory leadership over his successor as MEP. The veteran MEP has a track record for being outspoken, and past remarks have been seized on by critics as being homophobic and soft on date rape. I asked him if he regretting those remarks. \"I'm regretting the storm of media attention on those issues. I want to concentrate on issues to do with this by-election and what it means for Newark. \"There's also the fact of having the first UKIP MP in Westminster saying the things that so many people in Britain and Newark want to hear,\" he added. Labour's candidate Michael Payne hopes to shred that Conservative majority, but is UKIP a help or hindrance?  \"UKIP aren't the answer here in Newark,\" he said. \"UKIP wants to privatise our NHS. They want to water down drink-driving laws. What I'm concentrating on is talking to people who want a real alternative.  \"And the only way they can send that message to David Cameron and the Liberal Democrats who support him, is to vote Labour in the by-election.\"  The Liberal Democrats polled 20% in the last general election. Their candidate is David Watts, a Nottingham-based lawyer and a senior councillor in Broxtowe, where the Nottingham suburban council is a Labour/Lib-Dem coalition. \"I recognise we are no longer the party of protest because we are a party of government, \" said Mr Watts. \"We need to show the real benefits of voting Liberal Democrat and the difference we are making to this country.\" And no by-election is complete without the novelty value of a fringe independent. Buspass Elvis - aka Dave Bishop - is no stranger to by-elections.  He hopes to better the 67 votes he received in a council by-election in Nottingham last March. The result made national headlines:  . Even he admits, that's an unlikely prospect in Newark.  ",

        "article": "A:  It's hoped that by synchronising them with the European Elections, money will be saved and turnouts raised. A: It's a Thursday!  While there's nothing sacrosanct about Thursdays, it is a convention in this country that it is when elections are held. One theory is that it was originally the day generally considered least disruptive to  government and council business. The composition of the elected body would usually be known by the Friday, leaving the weekend for the formation of a new administration in time for the start of the  working week. In this case, it's the Thursday closest to the Sunday when voters go to the polls in the rest of Europe: the results will not be declared until after polls have closed across the EU on Sunday night: it would never do for the West Midlands results to skew the outcome in Westphalia, would it??!!     In addition to the vote every elector has in the European elections, there will be local elections in all seven giant metropolitan authorities in the West Midlands conurbation from Coventry to Wolverhampton. Then there are the 11 county districts where most will elect one-third of their councillors. But in Nuneaton and Bedworth and in Cheltenham half the seats are to be contested. With nearly 350 seats in play in 18 councils, this is a very big electoral deal in its own right. But that will not stop us from scouring the results for pointers towards the next general election.  This is inevitable with less than twelve months to go, especially here in a region where nearly 30 of our famous 'marginal' seats feature in the rival target lists for the two biggest parties: with both the Conservatives and Labour short of a Parliamentary majority, each needs gains from the other. And by an uncanny quirk of fate, two-thirds of those 18 councils holding elections also feature in the roll call of Parliamentary marginals. 1. BIRMINGHAM At the UK's largest local authority, Labour will retain control. But voting will be keenly watched to see if Labour can gain ground, in Edgbaston for example, which is always a key Parliamentary marginal. The Conservatives will hope to keep what they hold in Northfield and Bournville which will be general election target territory for them next May. The Liberal Democrats will be battling to hold off Labour in key wards including those in the Lib Dem's Parliamentary constituency of Yardley.  2. CANNOCK CHASE Labour currently hold 24 of the 41 seats and will be defending just 5 of the 13 wards going to the polls this time so they will be hoping to increase their majority. The council area exactly matches the Parliamentary constituency which Aidan Burley captured so sensationally for the  Conservatives with a 14% swing. He announced in February that he would stand down at the next election following his involvement in a Nazi-themed stag party. This is one of the areas where UKIP polled strongly in last year's county council elections. 3. CHELTENHAM The Regency spa town has had a Liberal Democrat MP for more than twenty years. It is also the only Liberal Democrat-controlled authority in our part of the country. Their ruling group's obituary has been written many times before and it does have twice as many seats as the Conservatives. But with Nick Clegg's party languishing in the polls this will be an important test of the Lib Dems' ability to retain traditional core support.  4. COVENTRY Labour will retain or even strengthen its comfortable majority. With no Liberal Democrats in the current council, attention will focus on UKIP's claims it is gaining support at Labour's expense and not just that of the Conservatives. 5. DUDLEY Having gained overall control in 2012 Labour defend 12 of its 42 seats this time, so it will hope to strengthen its position especially against a Conservative group afflicted by internal disputes and defections, especially to UKIP. Also on the council is Will Duckworth, the national Deputy Leader of the Green Party. Voting patterns will be closely scrutinised for pointers to the two Parliamentary marginals: Dudley North has a wafer-thin Labour majority and Dudley South is also a weather vane seat currently held by the Conservatives. 6. GLOUCESTER The Conservatives have 18 seats and Labour and the Liberal Democrats nine each. So the Conservatives look set to remain the largest party, but voting patterns will be closely scrutinised not just for UKIP's showing but also in terms of the city's barometer Parliamentary constituency. The Conservatives gained it from Labour at the last general election with a majority of under 2,500. 7. NEWCASTLE-UNDER-LYME Having deposed the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition last year, Labour have a majority of four. Most of its seats happen to be among its safest. This is one of the places to look at for evidence of the UKIP challenge: the council leader here failed in his bid for a county council seat last year, losing to an incumbent UKIP councillor by just two votes.  Labour have a Parliamentary majority here of just 1500. 8. NUNEATON AND BEDWORTH Labour won a majority last time and now have three times as many councillors as the Conservatives. Nuneaton's constituency has a Conservative majority of just over 2,000. 9. REDDITCH A see-saw council in a marginal Parliamentary constituency. Labour took back control from the Conservatives two years ago and currently hold 15 seats to the Conservatives' 13 with one  independent. The Parliamentary seat is held by the Conservatives with the 6,000 it achieved in defeating the former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith at the last general election. 10. RUGBY The Conservatives go into this election holding 25 seats to Labour's 10, the Liberal Democrats' 6 plus one independent. The Conservatives also won by-elections in May and November last year and have a Parliamentary majority of 6,000. 11. SANDWELL Labour enjoyed a clean sweep here in the last elections two years ago although three former councillors now sit as independents. One of only two remaining Conservatives is up for re-election.  12. SOLIHULL An intriguing contest: the Conservatives hold 28 of the 51 seats with a majority of five. But with five different parties contesting this election, the Conservatives need only to avoid a net loss of two seats to retain power. This is the Green party's strongest area in the West Midlands and with only one of its seven seats up for election it is hoping it could become the official opposition. The Liberal Democrats' performance will be a key factor in a Parliamentary constituency where it had a majority over the Conservatives last time of just 175. 13. STRATFORD-ON-AVON A Conservative stronghold. It has 30 seats to the Liberal Democrats' 14  and Labour's one. But the headline numbers belie the catalogue of internal strife and defections, one way and another, which lies beneath. Since the last elections, three Conservatives have become independents and two Liberal Democrats have switched to the Conservatives. The election of a Labour councillor last year is said to have surprised the party. 14. TAMWORTH Labour will be fighting hard to gain the three seats it needs to end ten years of Conservative rule in the home of Sir Robert Peel, father of modern-day Toryism. Labour will be defending only three of the 12 seats it holds, having gained five in 2012. As in Cannock, UKIP polled strongly here in last year's county council elections in a Parliamentary seat where the Conservatives currently have a 6,000 majority. 15. WALSALL A knife-edge contest will be scrutinised for general election pointers where both Parliamentary seats are on the Conservatives' target list. But Labour need a net gain of just three seats to depose the Conservative-Liberal Democrat administration and take power for the first time since 2000. The Conservatives currently hold 25 seats, their Liberal Democrat partners, five and Labour 28. One possibility is that independent councillors may hold the balance of power. UKIP, too, could make an impact: it polled more than 10% in each of the 8 wards contested in 2012. 16. WOLVERHAMPTON With 44 of the council's 60 seats, Labour has a comfortable majority but drastic budgets cuts are seeing the administration cutting 20% of their workforce over the coming year. Who takes the blame, the council or the government? One of the city's three Parliamentary seats, Wolverhampton South West, is a Conservative marginal with a majority of under 700. 17. WORCESTER 'The Faithful City' has seen some high drama since its last elections two years ago which left the Conservatives and Labour tied on 16 seats each. The Conservatives formed an administration with Liberal Democrat support. But when one Conservative defected to Labour and the Liberal Democrats switched allegiances, Labour were able to replace the Conservatives with a minority administration of their own. This time the Conservatives have two key target seats, including the ward currently held by the Con-Lab defector. If the Conservatives were to capture either or both targets and retain the five it is defending it would return to power: a high-octane contest in a key marginal Parliamentary seat where the Conservatives currently have a majority of under 3,000. 18. WYRE FOREST More than a decade after 'People Power' carried all before it by taking control of the council and getting the Independent MP Richard Taylor elected for an unprecedented two terms at Westminster. Health Concern currently hold nine seats, one more than Labour, so a  key contest will be the battle for second place. The Conservatives, with 19 seats, currently have a minority administration. But the Liberal Democrats, thanks to a combination of defeats and defections currently have no seats at all. Here at least, they have been outlived by the Liberal Party: the un-de-merged Liberal Party of Lloyd George and Jo Grimmond will be defending one of their three seats. If you are still with me, you will have seen by now why we are always so keen to take stock of elections like these, especially with less than a year to go to the main event.  They are serious tests of opinion in a part of the country which is always one of the most important general election battlefields. Equally, you will have gathered by now that there with so many local quirks and sub plots, every local council election has a tale to tell that is all its own. (Just look again at Wyre Forest)  A reminder, if ever we needed one, that there are limits to how far we should go in interpreting the bigger electoral picture. This really is chiefly about electing councillors after all!  ",

        "article": "Cuts to funding has left the UK's parks \"on the edge of a precipice\", according to a landmark report to be published next month by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).   The research into the quality of Britain's 26,000 public parks is expected to conclude that new ways of financing their maintenance are essential to prevent a return to the crisis days of the 1990s. MPs then described our urban green spaces as \"shunned, neglected and vandalised\". The warning about the decay of UK parks came at a meeting held among the manicured and flawless exhibits at the Chelsea Flower Show. \"We know from talking to park managers, friends groups and the public that we need to do something pretty serious if we are not going to face the same crisis we had in the past,\" Drew Bennellick from HLF said. \"Our research, published next month, shows that we are right on the edge of a precipice at the moment.\" Although many parks still outwardly look in good condition, the survey has identified how \"neglect has started to creep back in\".  In some places key infrastructure has not been properly maintained and lakes and ponds have not been dredged, next month's report will reveal. Public sector funding for discretionary services like parks is projected to fall by 60% or more over the next ten years, whoever wins the election in 2015.   \"Everybody realises that the old model won't do us for the next decade,\" says Graham Duxbury, chief executive of the environmental charity Groundwork. \"This isn't a case of muddling through.\" Mr Duxbury believes the notion that community volunteers can take responsibility for the UK's vital green infrastructure is misplaced.  \"Communities want to do more but not many of them can make that whole journey towards managing an asset like a park, running a business or a social enterprise,\" he says. \"You very easily get to burn out.\" The Heritage Lottery Fund is to fund a series of pilot schemes testing new ways of bridging the gap between what state and community can together provide and what Britain's public parks need to prevent decay.  \"It might be looking at endowments, public subscriptions, park improvement districts working with local business or ecosystem services where people pay parks to deliver draining solutions, for instance,\" says Mr Bennellick. Designer Wayne Hemingway, who chairs the Building for Life organisation, thinks big business should provide the answer. \"One of the reasons [David] Cameron doesn't go on about the Big Society any more is that it is not as big as he would like it to be,\" he says. \"Big business is doing pretty well - it would be very easy to show the value to them of taking part ownership of a park.\" Mr Hemingway suggested limited naming rights might be offered to local companies, echoing the 19th century philanthropic traditions that created the public park as we know it. For instance, among the earliest were Philips Park in Manchester and Peel Park in Salford, named after their benefactors, the politicians Mark Philips and Sir Robert Peel. Groundwork has designed an exhibit for the Chelsea Flower Show that focuses on the little patches of green, often in unpromising places, that can be enormously valuable to local communities. It is these smaller parks that the charity fears are most at risk when funding is cut. \"The people who come to Chelsea share a love of all things green,\" Mr Duxbury says. \"The message we want to get across is that that is also true for those who can't come to Chelsea, who don't have a large garden where they can experience the calming, restorative, healing benefits of green space.\"   ",

        "article": "Politics is one of the most complex areas of human thought. So when I heard the claim that scanning people's brains could predict political choices, I was naturally sceptical.  Brain science is achieving extraordinary insights, but mapping what you can measure in a brain scanner on to human social interactions is a huge leap, like trying to find exact correlations between two bowls of soup - only one soup is made from vegetables, macaroni and stock, and the other soup is made up of abstract ideas like economics, equality and history. But in the US and in Britain, psychologists and neuroscientists are doing serious research into linking political attitudes to what goes on inside our skulls.   \"By looking at how the brain is processing political phenomena, we can understand a little better why we're doing what we're doing,\" says Darren Schreiber, of Exeter University.  He started using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) while in America, to look at patterns of activity in the brain when people made decisions, especially those involving risk.  Writer and performer Timandra Harkness investigates how our political views are linked to the way our brains function. Personality Politics will be Broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 BST on Tuesday 20 May 2014 While their decisions weren't all that different, Dr Schreiber saw variation in the parts of the brain that were most active in self-described conservatives and those who called themselves liberal.  He won't generalise about exactly how conservatives and liberals think, but he does think his work suggests that differing political outlooks reflect deep-seated divergence in how we understand the world. Neuroscientist Read Montague, of University College London and Virginia Tech, was sceptical when approached to help political scientists with their research.  \"I laughed them out of the room,\" he says. But when John Hibbing and his team at the University of Nebraska showed him their data he changed his tune.  Their studies of twins suggested that political allegiance was partly genetic.  Not as strongly as height, for example, but enough to suggest that some people really could be dyed-in-the-wool conservatives - or dyed-in-the-DNA, at least. People like to believe that their own political beliefs are rational\u201d But how, exactly, could genetic differences be expressed as political differences in the real world?  Dr Hibbing and Dr Montague wanted to know if these innate predispositions could be observed at work in the brain.  So they tested instinctive responses to images designed to provoke disgust and fear, and found a link between the strength of response to the pictures, and how socially conservative a person's views were likely to be.  \"We need to make clear the distinction between economic conservatism and social conservatism,\" says Dr Hibbing.  \"People who have more protective attitudes about things like immigration, who are more eager to punish criminals, people who oppose abortion... these are individuals who seem to have a much stronger reaction to disgusting images.\"  These reactions are measured biologically, so the studies are linking explicit, conscious opinions with subconscious responses. In the research done so far, it's attitudes to risk, disgust and fear that show the strongest links to overt political views.  The difficulty comes when trying to apply these insights to a specific situation.  American social conservatives might also be strongly in favour of a smaller state and a freer market. In former Eastern bloc countries, social conservatism might make you more likely to hanker after the old days of Communism.  Behavioural economist Liam Delaney is studying the psychology of the Scottish independence referendum campaigns, but he warns against thinking that our subconscious instincts can be a complete guide to the debate.  Human politics is extraordinarily complex... If people were simplistic we wouldn't need these very big, complex brains\u201d \"Biological determinism is a little tricky with these situations, because there's just too much variation across different political systems.   \"So I think you'd risk simplifying things by saying that there is a hard-wire that's determining the outcome.\" Darren Schreiber agrees: \"Human politics is extraordinarily complex. It's not just reduced to brain, and I want to be very clear that I'm not a biological determinist. We're hardwired not to be hardwired.  \"If people were simplistic we wouldn't need these very big, complex brains.\" None of the scientists doing this research claims that our political views are completely innate.  Human brains change throughout our lives, so neuroscientists are careful to say that our experiences, as well as our genes, have shaped the brain they're putting in the scanner. But John Hibbing believes our subconscious drives, which evolved long ago in response to urgent physical dangers, direct our political minds more than we like to think.  \"People like to believe that their own political beliefs are rational, that they're a sensible response to the world around them, so when we come along and say, 'Maybe there are these predispositions, influential but perhaps not fully in your conscious awareness,' that's not the way we like to view our own political beliefs.\" He compares our innate ideological tendencies to which hand we prefer to use. We used to think of this as a habit that could be changed, yet now know it to be \"deeply embedded in biology\". That would have profound implications for political life. If being left-wing is as innate as being left-handed, why bother with politics at all?  Could we just put everybody in a brain scanner and infer what they think, and will always think, and were born to think, and stop trying to change anybody's mind? I was relieved to find that even John Hibbing doesn't draw that conclusion. \"It's not so much that I think people should just shut up and accept that some people are different. But I do think they should accept that some people are either not going to change or they're going to be extremely difficult to change, and that simply by continuing to shout at them, we're not contributing to anything.\" So we won't be swapping the ballot box for the brain scanner, any time soon.  Which is good, because I still think politics should be about taking our ideas out into the world beyond our skulls, the real world of challenging beliefs and clashing opinions. Perhaps I'm just hard-wired to think that way. ",

Clever clogs Lloyds, that most politically astute of banks, has responded by announcing that if you want to borrow more than \u00a3500,000, you will only get the loan if its value is no greater than four times the income of your household. \"Wah?\" you may say, if you are of a certain age. \"When I was a lad, you were lucky to get a loan of three times income.\" Which only goes to show that some pretty racy mortgages are being written by banks and building societies in the London and south east.  Perhaps the most amazing thing said by Lloyds yesterday is that this new constraint would have an impact on 8% of its London home loans business (and see my piece on last night's   for more on all of this). Bloomin' 'eck.  So to repeat what I said yesterday, it would be a bit odd if the Bank of England's new Financial Policy Committee did nought next month to take   of the residential property market. Anyway, this is a long pre-amble to a tangential point, which is that not all Mark Carney's colleagues at the Bank regard the bubblelicious housing market as the most worrying possible sinkhole on our journey to the sunny uplands of renewed prosperity. Which may surprise you a bit. But they take the view that after years of stagnation, property prices were bound to get a bit racy, once we all got a sniff of economic recovery. But that the Bank has important new tools to insulate banks and the wider economy from extreme housing-related shocks.  Hmmm. We'll see. The Financial Policy Committee's new tools are untested.  Gawd knows whether they'll be used in a timely and appropriate way, or whether they'll have adverse unexpected consequences.  But I suppose the bigger point is that British homes aren't the only asset currently looking a bit toppy, in the jargon. I am prohibited from recounting the contents of private conversations with Bank brains on all this. But I can give you this resonant quote from Charlie Bean, the retiring deputy governor of the Bank of England, who last night gave a valedictory speech at the London School of Economics. This is what Mr Bean said: \"Implied volatilities in many financial markets have been at historically low levels for some time. Together with low safe interest rates in the advance economies, that has underpinned a renewed search for yield and encouraged carry trades [where investors borrow cheaply to invest in assets offering a nominally higher return, but where that return is not necessarily higher when underlying risk is taken into account]. \"Taken in isolation, this is eerily reminiscent of what happened in the run-up to the crisis\". Or to put it another way, those controlling the world's great pools of money believe the world is a much safer place than it really is, and are taking foolhardy risks with their investments. In fact, the Bank's internal analysis shows that investors are behaving more irrationally and exuberantly even than perhaps implied by Mr Bean - the volatility of a raft of the world's most liquid and important assets, from shares, to currencies to government bonds, is lower even than at the peak of the boom before the devastating crash of 2007-8. So as and when any of the following possible accidents materialise - exacerbation of turmoil in Ukraine, a hard financial landing in China, cack-handed end of the era of free money in the developed economies, inter alia - \"we may yet encounter a few potholes\". Or so Mr Bean puts it, perhaps euphemistically. One of the great possible sources of future instability is the great overhang of government and official debt acquired by the central banks of the big rich economies through the money-creation exercise known as quantitative easing. Mr Bean signals that the Bank of England will not wish merely to sit on the \u00a3375bn of gilts or UK government bonds it has bought, and see that debt mountain gradually shrink as the Treasury repays on the assorted due dates. If the Bank were to do that, the unwinding of quantitative easing, the withdrawal of the new cash from the economy, would take around 50 years - which would be too long, he seems to think. So at some point, he says, the Bank of England will start to flog some of this stuff back to investors. When? Well it ain't going to be very soon. Because there is a risk that investors and the market would react quite adversely - pushing down the price of debt, and increasing implied interest rates pretty sharply. There could, therefore, be an over-reaction, in which the price of money would rise sharply, to the detriment of the wider economy. Which is why Mr Bean says the Bank cannot start to sell its gilts till the official interest rate has been raised to a high enough level, such that the Bank could make an emergency cut in it, as a form of evasive action.  But in spelling that out, Mr Bean has telegraphed to hedge funds and other investors the rules of a potentially lucrative game - the losers of which could be all of us. In that the rational thing for any investor to do would be to dump gilts in size as the Bank's policy rate was raised, to pre-empt and perhaps even deter possible gilt sales by the Bank (such that the investors could buy the gilts back at a depressed price, in the expectation of a bounce). Lucky Mr Bean is, of course, exiting the crucible of all this potential future mayhem before we find out whether the Bank of England will show wisdom and sensitivity in disposing of the debt and withdrawing \u00a3375bn of cash from the economy, or will emulate his famously accident-prone namesake.

        "article": "The Court of Appeal has overturned a decision to halt a fraud trial because of a lack of specialist criminal barristers prepared to take on the work.  I've covered the initial row over the prosecution - known as \"Operation Cotton\" -  The stakes could not have been higher going into the Court of Appeal. Had Sir Brian Leveson and the two other senior judges hearing the case upheld the stay of the prosecution, it would have amounted to a hammer blow to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's attempts to slash some parts of the legal aid bill.  Perhaps more importantly than the finances of the public purse, it could have brought the wheels of justice in complex and very high-cost criminal trials to a grinding halt.  So why did the Court of Appeal overrule Judge Anthony Leonard QC? His judgement was that the defendants could not find any specialist self-employed barristers or advocates who were employed by a government agency called the Public Defender Service.  Barristers had refused to sign new contracts for Very High Cost Cases after a 30% cut in fees - and the PDS, a government agency, was said to have nobody suitable available.  During the appeal, the Ministry of Justice said that it had implemented emergency measures to recruit more public defenders.  If that recruitment drive is successful, then ministers hope they will have sufficient barristers on the books to undertake work in cases like Operation Cotton - and that the costs will be lower than legal aid payments to traditional self-employed advocates.  , the Court of Appeal says that it is \"undeniably the responsibility\" of the Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling to sort out how the men in Operation Cotton are going to be represented.  So, quite simply, the Court said that while there may come a time when the case could not go ahead because of a lack of representation, that time had not yet come.  Sir Brian Leveson said: \"On our analysis there was a sufficient prospect of a sufficient number of PDS advocates who were then available who would enable a trial to proceed in January 2015. That pool included a sufficient number of advocates of the rank of QC.\" So the ball is now firmly in the Ministry of Justice's court. But even if Operation Cotton does finally get to trial, the judgement has not made the bigger problem go away. There needs to be some kind of new long-term deal between barristers and the government (that is assuming that the government isn't going to continue to expand the PDS).    And that's why Sir Brian Leveson has inserted a carefully worded observation at the end of the judgement.  He said that the criminal justice system needed the best possible advocates to ensure trials were fair, efficient and avoided potential miscarriages of justice.  \"We have no doubt that it is critical that there remains a thriving cadre of advocates capable of undertaking all types of publicly-funded work.\" Perhaps, most importantly, he notes that some of those advocates will be the judges of the future - the subtext being that if the government wants good decisions in the courts, then it needs to ensure the best people see a future in the business. \"In those circumstances, it is of fundamental importance that the Ministry of Justice, led by the Lord Chancellor, and the professions continue to try to resolve the impasse that presently stands in the way of the delivery of justice in the most complex of cases. \"The maintenance of a criminal justice system of which we can be proud depends on a sensible resolution.\" ",
