The more women are exposed to \"selfies\" and other photos on social media, the more they compare themselves negatively, according to a study. Friends' photos may be more influential than celebrity shots as they are of known contacts, say UK and US experts. The study is the first to link time on social media to poor body image. The mass media are known to influence how people feel about their appearance. The attention to physical attributes may be even more dangerous on social media than on traditional media because participants in social media are people we know\u201d But little is known about how social media impact on self-image. Young women are particularly high users of social networking sites and post more photographs of themselves on the internet than do men. To look at the impact on body image, researchers at the University of Strathclyde, Ohio University and University of Iowa surveyed 881 female college students in the US. The women answered questions about their Facebook use, eating and exercise regimes, and body image.  The research, presented at a conference in Seattle, found no link with eating disorders. But it did find a link between time spent on social networks and negative comparisons about body image. The more time women spent on Facebook, the more they compared their bodies with those of their friends, and the more they felt negative about their appearance. \"Spending more time on Facebook is not connected to developing a bad relationship with food, but there is a connection to poor body image,\" Petya Eckler, of the University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow, told the BBC. She added: \"The attention to physical attributes may be even more dangerous on social media than on traditional media because participants in social media are people we know.  \"These comparisons are much more relevant and hit closer to home. Yet they may be just as unrealistic as the images we see on traditional media.\"  A spokesperson for the Beat eating disorders charity said body image was a key part of our sense of identity and not a trivial matter or personal vanity.  A preoccupation with weight and shape was one of the key features of current popular culture, and was a global phenomenon, she said.  \"The fascination with celebrities, their bodies, clothes and appearance has all increased the pressure that people typically feel at a time when they seek to establish their own identities and when their bodies are growing and changing,\" she said.  \"Young people compare themselves to the images that bombard them and feel it is their fault that their bodies compare so unfavourably.\" ",

More cases of psychosis and schizophrenia now end up in hospital rather than being treated in the community, it said. Rethink Mental Illness published the report with the London School of Economics.  Cuts mean fewer people have access to early intervention treatment, such as talking therapy, Rethink said. It said the NHS could save more than \u00a350m a year by shifting its focus.  We recognise we must work to ensure that in everything we do mental health has parity of esteem with physical health\u201d Britain's recession in 2008 led to cuts across the NHS, as the government struggled to deal with ballooning deficits.   The report said it costs on average \u00a313 a day to support someone with psychosis or schizophrenia in the community.  It said this compared with the \u00a3350 average daily cost of keeping a mental health patient in hospital.  Meanwhile, 54% of the psychosis budget was being spent on inpatient care rather than on preventive community services, the report found. Family therapy, where families of people with psychosis and schizophrenia are supported, cognitive behavioural therapy, and peer support could help cut long-term costs of care, it said.  Health Minister Norman Lamb said early access to treatment in the community was \"often the best option\" for people with psychosis and schizophrenia.  He said: \"Not only do they benefit from being in familiar surroundings among loved ones but they are less likely to need costly hospital stays.\" Mr Lamb called for a \"shift of resources\" to preventive care and said that the government had given NHS England a \"clear objective\" to put mental and physical health on a par.  Mental health trust budgets for 2013-14 have fallen by 2.3% from 2011-12.  The cuts have meant   from next year's budgets than hospitals.  Budgets for community mental health teams, which give continuing support to patients to prevent their health deteriorating to crisis point,  .  The report also predicted more than \u00a350m a year could be saved if early detection services could be strengthened.  It said the NHS saved \u00a3989 every time people were treated with cognitive behavioural therapy instead of going to hospital.  Rethink said mental health accounted for 23% of the disease burden in England but received only 13% of the health budget. Dr Martin McShane, national director for long-term conditions at NHS England, said the report was \"very helpful\" and was supportive of what the organisation wanted to achieve.  He said: \"We recognise we must work to ensure that in everything we do mental health has parity of esteem with physical health.  \"We have significantly invested in improving access to psychological therapies and dementia care.\" ",

        "article": "Four women have had new vaginas grown in the laboratory and implanted by doctors in the US. A tissue sample and a biodegradable scaffold were used to grow vaginas in the right size and shape for each woman as well as being a tissue match.   They all reported normal levels of \"desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction\" and painless intercourse.  Experts said the study, published in the Lancet, was the latest example of the power of regenerative medicine.  In each woman the vagina did not form properly while they were still inside their mother's womb, a condition known as vaginal aplasia.   Current treatments can involve surgically creating a cavity, which is then lined with skin grafts or parts of the intestine.  Doctors at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centre in North Carolina used pioneering technology to build vaginas for the four women who were all in their teenage years at the time.  Scans of the pelvic region were used to design a tube-like 3D-scaffold for each patient.  A small tissue biopsy was taken from the poorly developed vulva and grown to create a large batch of cells in the laboratory.  This is an exciting glimpse into the future of medicine. Using living tissue as building material to transform the lives of patients has already happened with bladders, blood vessels and windpipes. Now you can add vaginas and noses to the list.  There are even attempts to make more complex organs. Weakly beating hearts, and kidneys that can produce urine, have been made in animal studies. But this is still a long way from being used in humans.   Expect 3D printing to revolutionise this field as the technology to precisely place both the cells and the scaffolding improves. Muscle cells were attached to the outside of the scaffold and vaginal-lining cells to the inside.  The vaginas were carefully grown in a bioreactor until they were suitable to be surgically implanted into the patients.   One of the women with an implanted vagina, who wished to keep her name anonymous, said: \"I believe in the beginning when you find out you feel different. \"I mean while you are living the process, you are seeing the possibilities you have and all the changes you'll go through.  \"Truly I feel very fortunate because I have a normal life, completely normal.\"  All the women reported normal sexual function.  Vaginal aplasia can lead to other abnormalities in the reproductive organs, but in two of the women the vagina was  connected to the uterus.   There have been no pregnancies, but for those women it is theoretically possible. Dr Anthony Atala, director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest, told the BBC News website: \"Really for the first time we've created a whole organ that was never there to start with, it was a challenge.\"  He said a functioning vagina was a \"very important thing\" for these women's lives and witnessing the difference it made to them \"was very rewarding to see\".  This is the first time the results have been reported. However, the first implants took place eight years ago.  Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Basel in Switzerland have used similar techniques to reconstruct the noses of patients after skin cancer.  It could replace the need to take cartilage from the ribs or ears in order to rebuild the damage caused by cutting the cancer away. Prof Martin Birchall, who has worked on lab-grown windpipes, commented: \"These authors have not only successfully treated several patients with a difficult clinical problem, but addressed some of the most important questions facing translation of tissue engineering technologies.   The steps between first-in-human experiences such as those reported here and their use in routine clinical care remain many, including larger trials with long-term follow-up, the development of clinical grade processing, scale-out, and commercialisation.\" ",

        "article": "Young men with an eating disorder are not getting the help and support they need because of a perceptions about a \"women's illness\", say researchers. Men are underdiagnosed and undertreated for anorexia and other eating disorders, despite making up about a quarter of cases, a UK study suggests. Frontline health workers have a key role in identifying eating disorders in young men, they report in  . Men are under pressure to have the \"ideal\" body image, says a charity. Researchers from the University of Oxford and University of Glasgow interviewed 39 young people aged 16 to 25, including 10 men, about their experiences of diagnosis, treatment and support for eating disorders. There is more pressure on men from magazines with celebrities and male models to have the 'ideal' body image\u201d They say young men with eating disorders were \"underdiagnosed, undertreated and underresearched\". This is partly because the men themselves were unaware of the symptoms, despite purging, not eating for days or obsessive calorie counting, they said. \"Our findings suggest that men may experience particular problems in recognising that they may have an eating disorder as a result of the continuing cultural construction of eating disorders as uniquely or predominantly a female problem,\" said Dr Ulla Raisanen and Dr Kate Hunt. One man said he thought eating disorders only affected \"fragile teenage girls\"; another said he thought eating disorders were \"something girls got\"; while one was told by his doctor to \"man up\". Others said they often had to wait a long time for specialist referral and had sometimes been misdiagnosed. GPs and other professionals such as teachers have a key role in improving the outlook for men with eating disorders by challenging misconceptions, the researchers said. And men themselves needed the courage to \"speak up to somebody and contact a health professional to tell them what is going on\", Dr Raisanen added. Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa; and binge eating disorder. One estimate puts the cost to the NHS of treating eating disorders at \u00a370m. Commenting on the research, Leanne Thorndyke, of the Beat eating disorders charity, said a wider section of society is coming under pressure over their body image. \"The pressures on body weight and body image are affecting a much wider range of people, which obviously includes men,\" she told BBC News. Eating disorders are complex - with a wide range of different factors, including genetics and the environment affecting risk - as well as social and cultural pressures. \"There is more pressure on men from magazines with celebrities and male models to have the 'ideal' body image,\" she added.  \"Boys and men tend to want to be bigger and more muscular and toned, which is a different ideal to women.\" She said people are \"bombarded by images every day from all angles, something that just wasn't there only a few years ago\", which can \"negatively impact some people\".

A total of 106 people donated organs in hospitals across Scotland last year compared with 54 in 2007. The statistics showed a 62% increase in organ transplants from deceased donors, with 341 operations carried out. However, about 600 people remain on the transplant waiting list. It is our responsibility to ensure that people's organ donation wishes are respected and to ensure that we make every donation count\u201d Some 2,110,881 people living in Scotland have now joined the UK Organ Donor Register. The figure means 40% of the Scottish population has registered, compared to 32% across the UK as a whole. Public Health Minister Michael Matheson said: \"First and foremost I want to offer my thanks to every donor and every donor's family in Scotland who have demonstrated such kindness and benevolence in the face of tragic and difficult circumstances. \"It is our responsibility to ensure that people's organ donation wishes are respected and to ensure that we make every donation count.\" Mr Matheson added: \"It's important to remember, however, that around 600 people in Scotland are still waiting for an organ and we must be doing all we can to give them hope.\" Peter McGeehan, 64, from Dunfermline, suffered serious heart failure and was listed for a transplant in 2004. In the ten years since a heart transplant, the father-of-two said he has thought about his donor every day.

CRI runs 21 needle exchanges in England and in 2010 it saw 290 people who were using steroids. By 2013 that number had increased to 2,161, a rise of 645%.  Now the health watchdog NICE has updated its guidelines for needle exchanges in England. It says the growth in steroid users is a \"challenge\" for drugs workers.  Dave Crosland - who is 6ft 2in, weighs 25st 7lb and has a 64in chest - spends hours in the gym, eats 10,000 calories a day and takes anabolic steroids. He thinks that without the steroids he would be at least six stone lighter.  Dave says he tolerates the drugs very well but admits to getting flu-like symptoms and swellings after injecting himself.   Side effects Dave adds: \"Think about going out and getting drunk. Think how rough you feel after that. It's very similar.\" He says there is some debate about whether or not he has got the biggest arm muscles in the country.  Steroids can let you train harder and for longer. They help to build up muscle mass but there is a long list of potential problems. The list of side effects range from acne, hair loss and shrunken testicles, to fertility, liver and heart problems. Even though he is very open about his own use, Dave also advises other people on the risks they could run.  He is increasingly worried about young users: \"There is a massive group of lads now, particularly in the 17 to 24 age group, that are abusing steroids something chronic, with no idea of what they're taking. \"They are messing themselves up quite severely, both mentally, hormonally and reproductively,\" he says. 'Pretty lean' Matt Tindall has just turned 17. He spends hours on end training at the gym but he is not getting the results he wants. His ideal would be to look like Arnold Schwarzenneger in his prime but he weighs 10st 7lb and admits he is \"pretty lean\".  He is thinking about taking steroids: \"It's just something you've got to consider if you want to put on some big size. \"I've come to Dave to ask him for some advice because, well, he's very large. Probably the largest person I've ever seen in real life.\" 'Gruesome' effects Dave tells Matt to forget about steroids until he is much older.   He says: \"I would never and I could never recommend anyone to use. It's a choice you have to make but if you are considering it, you need to wait quite a few years yet.\" Dave adds: \"The cold hard truth is of it is, yes they do work. But yes, there are side effects. The younger you use, certain side effects become more prevalent and the main one for you is fertility.\" After chatting to Dave, Matt is completely put off the idea. He says: \"The side effects are all quite gruesome. Is it really worth it?\" Body image Every couple of months Dave goes to stock up on clean equipment at a needle exchange. He drops off dirty needles and collects clean injecting equipment.     Needle and syringe programmes were set up in the 1980s to stop the spread of diseases like HIV.  Traditionally they have focused on people who inject drugs like heroin and crack cocaine.  But CRI says a third of the needle exchanges it runs now support more steroid users. \"We're seeing a lot more steroid users, and that is going up all the time,\" says David Rourke who works at the Arundel Street Project, a needle exchange in Sheffield.  He thinks it is partly due to pressure on people to look a certain way and says he also sees people who inject human growth hormone and tanning or slimming agents.  Drug addicts Prof Mike Kelly, the Director of Public Health at the health watchdog NICE, says the increase in steroid users is a \"challenge\". He says: \"They see themselves as big, fit, healthy. They don't see themselves as drug misusers, or drug addicts. We therefore need to find ways to make get them into our services.\" Prof Kelly adds: \"The risks are just the same. The risk of the spread of blood-borne infections, of HIV, hepatitis B and C.\" NICE has updated its guidelines for needle exchanges in England. The guidelines say needle and syringe programmes should adapt to steroid users by visiting gyms, staying open outside of normal working hours and giving specialist advice on training and nutrition.

A new survey also shows more than 28m people in the UK regularly get no more than seven hours sleep a night. Prof Richard Wiseman, who commissioned the YouGov poll described the findings as \"extremely worrying\". Of the 2,149 adults questioned, 78% said they used electronic devices before going to bed. This rose to 91% among the 18 to 24-year-olds questioned in the survey. \"The blue light from these devices suppresses the production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin, so it's important to avoid them before bed time,\" said Prof Richard Wiseman, from the University of Hertfordshire. Everyone needs different amounts of sleep, but adults are generally thought to require a minimum of seven to eight hours a night. Teenagers are recommended to get more, about nine hours. The proportion of people thought to be getting too little sleep had risen by a fifth since a \"bedroom poll\" conducted last year by the National Sleep Foundation. \"This is a huge rise, and the results are extremely worrying because getting less than seven hours sleep a night is below the recommended guidelines, and is associated with a range of problems, including an increased risk of weight gain, heart attacks, diabetes and cancer,\" Prof Wiseman said. The people surveyed were asked if they used a computer, tablet or smartphone in the two hours before bed. They were also asked about dreams and just one in ten agreed with the statement: \"I would describe my dreams as pleasant.\" Last week it was revealed opticians were warning that overuse of smartphones may be increasing people's risk of eye damage. Optician Andy Hepworth said: \"Blue violet light is potentially hazardous and toxic to the back of your eyes. \"So over a long period of time it can potentially damage your eyes.  \"When you're looking at a smart phone, the light peaking out of that is blue violet.\" The news came as a survey of 2,000 people suggests under-25s check their phones 32 times a day.

On Wednesday, Mr Cameron said Welsh Labour's health record was \"dreadful\" and the NHS in Wales was \"a shambles\".  Mr Jones said the prime minister was \"trying to divert attention from his own problems - it's an old trick\".  Mr Jones also accused Whitehall of colluding with newspapers about a senior military figure voicing concern about hospital waiting times in Wales. Responding to Mr Cameron's latest attack on the Welsh government, Mr Jones told BBC Radio Wales: \"This is the thirty-first time that he's done this - it's becoming a bit of an obsession for him.\" ...there is no doubt this was simply a way of using our veterans, people who have fought for this country, as a way of attacking one part of the UK for political ends\u201d At question time in the House of Commons, Mr Cameron had said: \"We have seen an 8% cut to the budget in Wales for the NHS.  \"The last time A&E targets were met was 2009, the last time cancer treatment targets were met was 2008. \"Over a third of people miss out on access to diagnostic services within eight weeks. \"There is a truly dreadful record when it comes to Labour's NHS in Wales and you see a huge contrast now with the NHS in England - properly funded, well run, meeting the key targets - and the shambles there is in Wales.\" The prime minister was responding to a question from the Vale of Glamorgan Tory MP Alun Cairns, who suggested the Welsh government could be undermining the operation of the armed forces because soldiers had to wait longer for treatment. Speaking on the Jason Mohammad programme, the first minister said the Ministry of Defence was \"running away\" from the story that emerged on Sunday, about service personnel spending longer on waiting lists Wales than other parts of the UK.

Some special adviser in London thought it was a good idea to give the story to some of the papers as a way to have a go at us.\" The MoD responded to a freedom of information request to release documents \"within hours\", he said.  \"Collusion - there's no question about that in my mind,\" said Mr Jones. He claimed soldiers from Wales were being used for \"political purposes\".

        "article": "Texas is a very energetic, smart and playful German shepherd dog. \"He always tries his best to please me,\" said his owner Helene B\u00e4ckman.  But when Texas was six months old, Helene noticed that he started to behave unusually. He started to jump and bite the air repeatedly.  \"It\u00b4s like he sees something. He jumps and when he\u00b4s biting, he bites hard,\" she said. \"You can hear his teeth against each other.   \"He can do this for hours and he gets more and more stressed when he\u00b4s doing it. He never rests between jumps.\" The reason for Texas's unusual behaviour? Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is well described in humans and the dog version of the disease presents with similar repetitive behaviours.  Whereas people might wash their hands multiple times or hoard objects, dog symptoms include constantly chasing their own tails or shadows, blanket sucking or repeated grooming. Texas's symptoms include a behaviour called fly-catching.  It is much easier to find disease genes in dogs than in people\u201d This is where dogs snap or chomp at the air as if they're trying to catch imaginary flies.  \"It hasn't been easy to get him diagnosed because nearly all people around me have said that just the way he is,\" said Helene.  \"I live in the north of Sweden and had to drive 700km to [the vet who diagnosed him] in Stockholm.\" OCD is one of hundreds of diseases that the domestic dog suffers from that presents in a very similar way to the human form of the condition.  Other \"human\" conditions that dogs are susceptible include: Although seeing our canine companions suffer may be upsetting, these shared diseases mean that dogs are emerging as one of the most important animal models of human hereditary diseases, advancing our understanding and paving the way for new therapies. Recent studies have identified genes that might cause the canine form of these conditions.  \"It is much easier to find disease genes in dogs than in people,\" said Prof Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, of Uppsala University and the Broad Institute.  This is due to the fact that humans have been breeding dogs for hundreds of years.  Selecting dogs to create pups with specific characteristics has resulted in a certain amount of inbreeding, allowing disease-causing genes to become widespread in certain breeds. This breeding history also means that all dogs within a breed are very similar genetically.  \"This makes the search for the specific disease mutations less complex,\" said Prof Lindblad-Toh. \"In dogs we can find [disease-causing] genes with only a few hundred sick and healthy dogs, whereas in people thousands of patients and controls are needed.\" In 2005, Prof Lindblad-Toh's team analysed all the genes of a female boxer called Tasha to produce an extremely accurate genetic sequence for the dog.  They, and other groups, have shown that the genetic sequence that makes up dogs like Tasha is quite similar to humans, meaning that many of the genes causing a disease in dogs may also be behind the manifestation of the condition in humans.  Prof Lindblad-Toh and her colleagues have recently published a   in Genome Biology which has identified four genes that are associated with OCD in dogs like Texas.  They are currently carrying out studies into whether these genes are also implicated in the human condition.  \"Since the disease symptoms and medications used in dogs and people are similar, we expect that the same genes or other genes with similar functions will be responsible for the disease also in humans,\" said Prof Lindblad-Toh. Pets are often used for these studies. The fact that they live in the same environment as us gives the dog another advantage over other disease models.  \"Dogs are exposed to many of the same stressors that contribute to health problems,\" said Jon Bowen, behaviour consultant and veterinary surgeon at the Royal Veterinary College in the UK.  \"Their diet often contains the leftovers from human meals, they are exposed to family stress (such as arguments and conflict), and are relatively socially isolated from members of their own species.\"  It is known that the environment can have an effect on how genes are expressed, and so any gene-environment interactions that cause human disease also affect our canine friends.   Media requires JavaScript to play. Lizzie Crouch meets Blu the dog, who suffers from canine epilepsy Currently, researchers still rely heavily on genetically engineered mice to further our understanding of a whole range of conditions.  Whether ethically right or not, our knowledge of human disease has progressed considerably as our understanding of how we can genetically induce disease in mice has advanced. But there are limitations. Research is done primarily in specific strains of young mice, specially bred for research and genetically manipulated to induce a disease.  You have to have some understanding of what genes you need to manipulate in order to induce the disease, and not every disease can be induced through such genetic manipulation. \"Naturally occurring diseases in animals are a lot more complex,\" said Holger Volk, professor of veterinary neurology and neurosurgery at the Royal Veterinary College. \"In a rodent you simplify a lot of things.\" But these simplified diseases in rodents are far removed from the complicated reality of naturally occurring diseases.  \"When you look at certain diseases in humans, there are so many factors which could be involved [in causing that disease],\" Prof Volk said. These factors, and the fact we are a complex organism, can often hinder our search for the underlying genetic cause of a disease.  The relative ease with which you can find disease-causing genes in dogs, combined with the shared organism complexity and environmental factors, means it is likely that understanding hereditary disease in dog will take us further in understanding human diseases that rodents can. Using the dog for investigations into physical diseases has had already led to significant advances in our understanding.  For example, the identification of the genetic basis of narcolepsy in dogs led investigators to a previously unknown pathway in the brain, while other studies have led to the development of a new gene therapy for haemophilia, which is showing promise in clinical trials. Experts say that there is increasing recognition of the value that veterinary medicine can bring to human medical studies.  \"Wherever we can, we try to present our work at medical meetings and conferences, so that the medical profession can see what we are doing. Universally this gets a great response,\" said Mr Bowen. There are also large schemes, such as the One Medicine Initiative, that hope to bring together researchers in medicine and veterinary medicine to solve health problems, currently being carried out that recognise the important link between the two fields.  \"My research is driven to improve animal health,\" says Prof Volk. \"And by doing that I can also help the human counterpart; it's a win-win situation for both species.\" ",

Evie is now aged six months - and returned to St Thomas' NHS Hospital in London last week to have the devices activated. Staff there have emphasised her case is exceptional. Evie became profoundly deaf after contracting pneumococcal meningitis when she was just three days old. \"Implants give these children a different dimension to their life - something they wouldn't otherwise have.\u201d She spent six weeks in intensive care, and needed to be on a ventilator for a fortnight.  She was given cochlear implants at an exceptionally young age because the meningitis led to bony growth - or ossification - in her inner ear.  The damage to Evie's ears was getting worse, which meant that waiting for implants at a later stage was not an option. Cochlear implants cannot cure deafness - but they help Evie and children like her experience sound. Audiological specialists fitted external processors to the outside of Evie's ears - these pick up sound and connect with the internal implants, which help send electrical signals to the brain. The staff at St Thomas' banged a drum to monitor Evie's responses, as they programmed the processor. Watching her stir as she absorbed the sound meant the world to her parents.  Her mother, Jenny Harvey, 33, from Kent, told me: \"When we found out she was deaf, what affected me most was the thought of her speech being impaired. \"But hopefully her speech should be very good - with input from the speech and language therapists.  \"We're looking forward to hearing her say mummy and daddy. \"We didn't think we'd get to this stage. The outlook wasn't very good for Evie when she was very ill. \"It's such a relief that she's responding to the implants. It feels as though we're getting some good news now.\" Many hospital appointments still lie ahead for Evie - but activating the implants has been a milestone for her parents.  Her father, Barrie Smith, 34, said: \"We're hoping that Evie will go to a mainstream school.  \"There are some things we still don't know about Evie's longer-term development - she will tell us as she grows older.\" Evie is now among around 5,000 children in the UK who have cochlear implants.  Some deaf people are opposed to implants, and believe that deaf children should instead learn to sign and become members of the deaf community. Katherine Wilson, the principal audiological scientist at St Thomas' Hospital, stressed that Evie had the implants at an exceptionally young age because of the after-effects of her meningitis. She said: \"We had to move very quickly to treat her. The bony growth in the inner ears that she had after meningitis meant we wouldn't have been able to get the implants in later. It just wouldn't have been a possibility. \"The activation process went fabulously well. We never know how young children will react, but Evie showed typical behaviours you'd expect from a baby of her age. \"This will be a long and slow process, with her coming back to hospital many times to have the devices re-programmed.  \"We're not trying to cure deafness - this is a way of managing and treating it.  \"Implants give these children a different dimension to their life - something they wouldn't otherwise have. \"When Evie has the implants on, she'll be able to pick up on sound and speech, and hear her mum and dad calling her. When the implants are off, she's still a deaf child. \"But because of her young age, she has every chance to develop her speech and language, to be able to communicate with hearing people, and to hear the rich sounds of the world.\" ",

        "article": "The review of the four UK health systems by the Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation has been a painstaking piece of work. Researchers have been working on it for the best part of four years, grappling with different data sets on topics as diverse as spending, waiting times and death rates. But it is perhaps the questions the report poses rather than the ones it answers that provide most food for thought. Post devolution, the UK has three distinctive systems.  In England, there is a great deal of emphasis on competition (both between NHS bodies themselves and with the private sector). By contrast, in Scotland and Wales collaboration is key; and in Northern Ireland there is an integrated approach where health and social care are part of the same system. It should provide a perfect platform from which to assess the merits of each approach. Except it doesn't. Performance on a whole host of measures is remarkably similar - or where there are differences there are obvious answers. For example, the slower adoption of targets outside England can explain some of the gap on waiting times, while the higher burden of ill health is the main reason that Scotland lags behind on measures such as life expectancy and death rates. These factors can also give an answer to why Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland appear to be catching up with England on some measures - it is easier to make faster progress from a lower base. But all this just raises the question: what actually does influence performance? Funding was the obvious answers proposed by researchers. However, the report also throws up some other, interesting theories. Local data was provided for one region - the North East of England. This was chosen because in terms of population demographics and health profile it was considered to be the closest fit to Wales and Scotland. The findings were fascinating. In the early 1990s death rates and life expectancy were similar to Scotland, but now the North East is outperforming it by 15% to 19% on death rates and a year of life expectancy. So what has happened? Well, it wasn't the impact of competition within the NHS, which is much less frequently used in the North East than elsewhere in England. Instead, study leader Prof Nick Mays suggested it could be linked to the lack of high-paid jobs in other professions, which allows the NHS to recruit and retain the most talented staff. It is not the first time this point has been made. The Centre for Economic Performance also noted the correlation in  . If that is the case, it raises two interesting points. First - unsurprisingly - money matters when it comes to attracting the best staff. But second, what happens locally (and it would be fair to assume this could apply to a host of other factors) is perhaps more important than the national levers that politicians pull. So instead of looking at performance across countries, it might be better to think of the NHS as a collection of many different systems. ",

        "article": "The white stuff you sprinkle on your food is back in the headlines. Whether it's salt or sugar, it seems many of us may be consuming too much. So how easy is it to live without  processed food for a week? Helen Briggs finds out. The first day of my new regime involves rifling through kitchen cupboards to see what I'm permitted to eat. The definition of processed food varies, but according to the US Food and Drug Administration it comprises: So out with pasta, oil, tinned tomatoes and many other staples.  Unlimited fruit and vegetables are an easy option, along with the humble baked spud. Processed foods aren't always a bad thing but this does highlight the importance of clear food labels. \u201d But what about protein? I don't eat meat so that means soaking and cooking my own lentils and chickpeas, rather than buying them tinned. It's a work day, so I have to pack an entire day's supply of rations. I can't rely on my usual soup or salad as it's bound to contain something processed, like stock cubes or mayonnaise. So, I load up with fruit - banana for breakfast; apple and oranges for snacks. Then, horror of horror, I'm struck by qualms about coffee - does it count as processed? Victoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation, has agreed to help me with my quest, so I ping off a panicky email. Thankfully, she grants me a concession - I can have coffee as long as I buy the coffee beans and grind them myself. Another thing to add to my to-do list, then. Tired this morning after an evening up late soaking chick-peas, boiling lentils and grinding coffee beans. My children are peering into dirty saucepans: \"What's all this burnt gooey stuff, Mummy?\" My rucksack is bulging with pots of things - home-made chick-pea salad, nuts, bananas, bunch of grapes, and yet another variety of home-made salad. I am starting to crave sugar, and patrol hungrily around the canteen in search of anything non-processed. A new routine this morning. To analyse what I'm eating, Victoria has asked me to weigh all my food three days a week. To add to the grinding, soaking and boiling, I now need to put everything on the scales. On the plus side I  think my diet is having some effect - I feel healthy and full of energy. I've discovered that adding herbs to things is a good way to get flavour without using salt, sugar or sauces. Mint tea has become a speciality - fresh mint in the bottom of a mug, topped up with hot water, and you're good to go. I am also saving a fortune on ditching take-out coffees (although I have to confess to the occasional illicit non home-ground Americano). I like to think I'm pretty good at checking food labels. But a cursory glance, before chucking it into the supermarket trolley, is no longer good enough. I am finding out that sugar or salt can be sneaked in to many things you wouldn't expect. The unprocessed pistachio nuts, complete with shells, I pick up in the supermarket queue actually have added salt. And sugar can be hard to spot on food labels, listed as high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, malt syrup, maltose and evaporated cane juice, among other things.  In the UK, cooking food at home is becoming a thing of the past.  In the last decade, money spent on take-aways and eating out has gone up by almost a third. I spend my Saturday the old-fashioned way - batch-cooking meals that can be eaten over the course of the next few days. A family birthday so eating out is unavoidable. The waiter is starting to get impatient with my questions. Is the risotto made with home-made stock? Does it have any added sugar/salt/artificial things? Eating out is a minefield when you're forbidden from adding anything to your food. Whether it's a take-away sandwich, a morning cappuccino or a birthday celebration in a restaurant, finding out exactly what is in your food is a nutritional nightmare. The week has been enlightening - and it's definitely something I will do again. But without a lot of forward planning and preparation, it's impractical for many. I could have opted for a more varied diet such as grilled fish and steamed vegetables, but without my own personal chef or a job working from home, that was beyond me. So how did I do? According to Victoria Taylor, not too badly. She says based on a comparison with my \"control\" week, my salt and saturated fat intake were both reduced by half.   The main reason for me - as a non-meat eater - was giving up bread and cheese, which, while not conventional processed foods - can be relatively high in salt and saturated fat. \"Although Helen wasn't feasting on foods we typically think of as processed, like ready-made meals, pizzas or crisps, her experiment does show how it's often the everyday foods like cheese and bread that make a big difference to the amount of saturated fat and salt we are eating,\" she says. \"Processed foods aren't always a bad thing but this does highlight the importance of clear food labels.  \"Colour coded labels which give at-a-glance information are an easy way to work out if the food you're eating is the healthy choice.\" ",

        "article": "Bad weather and a delayed flight might be a recipe for misery - but in one instance 50 years ago it led to a discovery that has saved countless thousands of lives.  The discovery of the Epstein Barr virus - named after British doctor Anthony Epstein - resulted from his specialist knowledge of viruses which caused tumours in chickens plus his skills gained using one of the first commercially-available electron microscopes.  I had the feeling that this was something special\u201d His hunch was assisted by a longer than expected journey of some tumour cells from Uganda, which were nearly thrown in the bin.  But it would never have happened if Epstein's curiosity hadn't been fired up by a lecture by the Irish doctor turned \"bush surgeon\", Denis Burkitt.  In the lecture, billed as a staff meeting on \"The Commonest Children's Cancer in Tropical Africa\", Burkitt described how he had noticed a number of cases of debilitating tumours which grew around the jawbone of children in specific regions - particularly those with high temperatures and high rainfall.  We now know this as Burkitt lymphoma.  Sir Anthony Epstein, now 93,  , recalls: \"I thought there must be some biological agent involved. I was working on chicken viruses which cause cancer. I had virus-inducing tumours at the front of my head. I thought... [it] was being carried by some insect vector, or some tic. That's why it was temperature-related.\"   The Epstein Barr virus belongs to the family of herpes viruses - and is linked to a number of different conditions, depending on where you live.  Most people are infected with the Epstein Barr virus. It's best known in high-income countries for causing glandular fever which causes a sore throat, extreme fatigue and swollen glands in the neck.  According to Dorothy Crawford, emeritus professor of microbiology at Edinburgh University, up to 95% of all adults are infected with the virus.  \"The virus is spread in childhood at different rates - in the saliva, so through close contact.  In African countries most children have it by the age of two because they share cups in their household.  \"The rate is lower in middle-class areas of England, so if you haven't already been exposed by your early teens it can cause glandular fever.\"   This has given it the nickname the kissing disease because, she explained: \"People kissing in the back row of the cinema exchange more saliva than young children sharing toys.\"  Epstein asked for samples of the tumours from Burkitt and they were sent back on overnight flights from Uganda.  For almost three years Epstein's efforts to retrieve virus from the tumour cells failed, despite trying several culture methods used successfully for other viruses like influenza and measles.   In the end bad weather came to the rescue.  Fog delayed one flight which was diverted to Manchester, 200 miles from London. So the sample taken from the upper jaw of a nine-year-old girl with   didn't get to Epstein until late one Friday afternoon on 5 December 1963.   At that point it looked past its sell-by date.  \"The fluid was cloudy. This suggested it had been contaminated on the way,\" Epstein said.  \"Was it full of multiplying bacteria? Before we threw it away I looked at it under a wet preparation microscope and saw huge numbers of free-floating, healthy looking tumour cells which had been shed from the edge of the tumour.\"  Traditionally, growing cells successfully in culture had involved sticking them to a glass surface for support, but the lymphoma cells seemed to favour growing in a suspension.   Once all other conventional tests for identifying the virus from the cultured cells had failed, Epstein tried electron microscopy. The very first grid square he viewed included a cell filled with herpes virus.  Exhilarated by what he'd seen, Epstein went for a walk in the winter snow and came back feeling calmer.  \"I was extremely frightened in case the electron beam [of the microscope] burned up the sample. I recognised at once the herpes virus - there were five then, now nine. Any of the then-known ones would have wiped the culture out when they were replicating but this wasn't happening.  I had the feeling that this was something special.\"  Our understanding of this pervasive virus, named after Epstein and one of his PhD students Yvonne Barr who helped to prepare the samples, has increased over the years since Epstein confirmed his findings with American virologist colleagues.  Burkitt's data helped to identify that the tumour named after him was seen in children with chronic malaria, which reduced their resistance to the Epstein Barr virus, allowing it to thrive.  But most of us live quite happily with the virus.  \"If you disturb the host-virus balance in any way then changes take place which lead to very unpleasant consequences,\" says Epstein.  \"Once the link between Epstein Barr virus and Burkitt lymphoma was established, other seemingly unrelated conditions followed. These include a cancer at the back of the nose which is the commonest cancer seen in men in southern China and the second commonest in women in the same region.  There is also a link to Hodgkins lymphoma, a cancer of the white blood cells.  \"Each one came out of the blue,\" according to Epstein, \"and we've just heard about another. About 20% of Japanese cancers of the stomach are associated with the virus.\"  Yet another connection was made by Professor Dorothy Crawford, while waiting for the lift at the Royal Free hospital in London.  \"It's such a tall building everyone meets outside the lifts. I was standing next to a renal [kidney] transplant surgeon and overheard him say they'd just had their first case of post-transplant lymphoma. So I went with him to the pathology department and asked for some sections of the tissue to look at under the microscope.\" Burkitt lymphoma can now often be treated successfully with chemotherapy.  At a recent meeting in Oxford of the   future directions for research were explored.  Attention is now focusing on a vaccine for the Epstein Barr virus - and some efficacy has already been demonstrated.  Epstein hopes that a vaccine will lead to the kind of success seen in other cancers caused by viruses - such as Hepatitis B and the human papillomavirus, which cause liver and cervical cancer respectively.

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Many Ugandans are wary of getting tested because of the stigma of being HIV-positive Private clinics in Uganda's capital, Kampala, are selling fake HIV negative certificates to help people get jobs, an undercover investigation by BBC Africa's Catherine Byaruhanga has revealed.  It is the tail-end of the morning rush-hour when I meet Sarah outside a popular supermarket in a suburb of Kampala.  She is a young woman in her 20s, with dreadlocks. She is anxious, and can hardly look me in the eye.  So I am careful not to push her too hard.  I, along with my BBC colleagues, spent several weeks trying to track down someone who had paid for a fake HIV-negative certificate.  Most of the people we spoke to were too scared to be interviewed. Sarah isn't her real name - she would only talk to us if we hid her identity. We visited 15 clinics - 12 were willing to give us a fake negative result\u201d \"I had to get the fake negative results because if I gave the company my positive results I was not going to get employed,\" she told the BBC.  \"I'm a single mother. I'm struggling. I need this money. I need this job for my child.\"  We heard several accounts of people buying bogus HIV-negative results in order to get a job, to travel abroad or to lie to sexual partners because of the huge stigma against people with HIV here. We went undercover to several clinics in Kampala, pretending to be HIV-positive job-seekers in need of a negative certificate to show prospective employers.  These were small private clinics - there are hundreds of them all over Kampala. Inside, there were a handful of staff, a doctor maybe but usually a nurse and a laboratory technician who carries out the testing.  We visited 15 clinics - 12 were willing to give us a fake negative result. One laboratory technician said it was very risky for him to give a fake certificate and he could be arrested. After some negotiations, he agreed to write it for around $20 (\u00a312).   Media requires JavaScript to play. A lab technician agrees to sell a fake certificate The certificates have everything to make them look official, including the clinic's official stamp and the health worker's signature. This evidence comes at a time when many people here are taking a critical look at Uganda's HIV policies. For years, the country was seen as a global leader in the fight against the disease.  Twenty years ago, around one in five Ugandans had the virus, the government quickly got behind Aids campaigns and by 2005 the rate was brought down to 6.3%.  But in recent years the number of people with HIV has started to rise again, to 7.2% in 2012. Once again, the government and activists are fighting to turn things around.  The message is: \"Get tested\". Everywhere you go in Kampala there are billboards and posters urging people to find out their status.  Even President Yoweri Museveni and his wife have taken public tests.  The idea is once people find out they are HIV-positive they can get onto anti-retroviral medicines and be counselled so they don't spread the disease.  But the massive social stigma means many are just too scared. Last year, a survey of more than 1,000 Ugandans living with HIV/Aids was carried out by the National Forum of People Living with HIV/Aids Networks in Uganda (Nafophanu). It found that more 60% of them faced stigma; either being shunned by relatives or friends or losing a job.  Many people in Uganda still see it as a disease of the immoral, those who have led a promiscuous life.  The HIV-positive people we have spoken to add that employers are not willing to hire them because they think the disease will make them less efficient at work. Nafophanu head Stella Kentutsi says this stigma leads some HIV-positive people to avoid accessing health services.  This then leads to more people dying of the disease and passing it on to their partners.  Nicolette Uwimana has chosen to be open about being HIV-positive but, she says, that has made her life difficult.  She is a beautiful young woman, welcoming and very confident. Her purple extensions match her bright pink top with the printed slogan: \"HIV stops with me\".  Ms Uwimana contracted the virus at the age of 10 after being raped. Her family initially took care of her but eventually kicked her out because her treatment became expensive. She now lives in a cramped room with four others. It does not shock me Nevertheless, it's a challenge for government and the country to pull up its socks and squarely face this problem\u201d \"My friends don't even want to associate with me, those who are not positive,\" she said.  \"And when they hear my story they tend to point fingers - 'You went looking for it,' because they don't actually know, they don't understand what somebody goes through. \"And for quite some time now I haven't been working because everywhere I go to look for a job the first thing they ask me is my status.\"  Nonetheless, Ms Uwimana is adamant that sharing her story will give her peace of mind and help her come to terms with her ordeal.  For now, she earns some money by making jewellery and speaking at HIV events. We showed our undercover footage to Uganda's Health Minister Ruhakana Rugunda. He admits the government could do more to stop the issuance of fake HIV-negative results.  \"It does not shock me [that people are buying bogus negative results] Nevertheless, it's a challenge for government and the country to pull up its socks and squarely face this problem,\" he told the BBC.  He said the police had handled some cases, but it is not a problem for them to solve.  Instead, companies should stop stigmatising job seekers who are HIV-positive, Mr Rugunda said.   \"I think that's discriminatory. I think that's pushing people to tell lies and to fake certificates,\" he told the BBC.  But there are no laws to protect HIV-positive people against discrimination. At the same time, the government is proposing legislation that activists fear will increase stigmatisation.  The HIV and Aids Prevention and Control Bill 2010 has clauses that aim to punish people who transmit the virus.  Health-workers will also be obliged to divulge the status of anyone they think could pass on HIV to their partner. The US funds the majority of Uganda's HIV programmes, mainly through non-governmental organisations. In the past decade, it has contributed more than $2bn.  US ambassador to Kampala Scott DeLisi told the BBC he could not guarantee that US money had not gone to clinics giving out fake HIV-negative certificates.  But he says the responsibility to monitor programmes lies with Uganda.  \"When they find these problems, they have to prosecute people. They have to show they're serious about it.\" Sarah says she takes responsibility for breaking the law and lying about her HIV status but says she would do it again for the sake of her child.  \"Why should I sit back and say: 'Let me do the right thing'. At the end of the day, it's me who's going to suffer. It's my child,\" Sarah told the BBC.  \"No-one is going to listen to me. I'm going to die and if I die just like that, who's going to speak out for me?\" ",

        "article": "\"I get so anxious if I want to go out to things. I live with my Mum because I don't want to live on my own. I can't do money. I wish I could.\"  Chris Steel is 40 years old. He is remarkably friendly and engaging, and is happiest when he is on stage acting in plays such as George Orwell's Animal Farm.  As a child, his caring nature led him to take to the bedside of a victim of the Hillsborough disaster, with such compassion and diligence he was given an award by former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  Chris is great to take to parties... but he is too trusting\u201d But he is unable to go out alone - once, when he did, his openness towards strangers and difficulty in understanding when he is in danger meant he lent his phone to a stranger, who stole it.  He has severe anxiety, and needs constant reassurance from the people around him.   Chris has Williams Syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder affecting around one in 18,000 people in Britain. It has often been dubbed the 'opposite of autism'.  People with WS are empathetic, social, friendly and endearing but they tend to have a low IQ, making tasks such as counting money difficult.  They can feel anxious over stimuli such as the buzzing of a bee, or the texture of food.  The need for reassurance in some cases can leave children of loving households calling 999 and feigning an emergency, as they crave adult attention so much. WS, first identified in 1961, can also cause heart problems, developmental delays, and learning disabilities.  For the psychological side of the disorder, acting can play to the strengths of people with WS. Chris says: \"I am good at reeling people in and being a character in different things.\" He acts with a charity called Mind the Gap, based in Bradford, near his home town of Bingley in West Yorkshire, and cites the time he was a pirate in a play called Treasure Island as amongst his favourites.  When he was a child, and visiting his father in hospital, Chris met  when he was crushed in the Hillsborough stadium disaster in 1989.  Chris befriended Tony, and stayed, loyally, by his bedside for weeks. \"Chris can talk to anyone and doesn't need a response,\" his mother Judy says.  It can be difficult when you see the surge of funding for the tidal wave of autism\u201d Judy says he is also \"great to take to parties\" as he happily introduces himself to new people.  But there is a flip side of this social ease. Judy says Chris is \"too trusting\", and has been taken advantage of.  She said he also needs people around him to be happy and guide him in what opinions he should have.  People with WS may make prolonged eye-contact, and be over-engaging, which can put them in danger. There are also further aspects of the disorder which can land them in hot water.  Lizzie Hurst, chief executive at the Williams Syndrome Foundation, says: \"People [with the disorder] conduct themselves in a way that makes them extremely vulnerable.  \"They don't have the cognitive ability to match their linguistic age. \"There is a classic autistic profile to which Williams Syndrome is the polar opposite. People can gauge the mood of a crowd and adopt without understanding the nuances of the situation.\" Ms Hurst says there were \"questions to be raised\" over whether people with WS could be legally responsible for themselves. \"I would say they cannot,\" she adds.  She is working to raise the profile of the disorder amongst GPs, as she says only one in 40 GPs will encounter the disorder and babies with WS can be difficult to identify.  Facial features in young children include a small, upturned nose, long upper lip, wide mouth, full lips, small chin and a white lacy pattern on the eye's iris.   Anxiety can be made worse if the disorder is not diagnosed, she said, as people feel even more isolated. Ms Hurst's charity does not get any funding from the government, relying on fundraising and donations. She puts on barbecues, Christmas parties and holidays for people with WS and their families.  \"I think the government should do more,\" she says. \"It can be difficult when you see the surge of funding for the tidal wave of autism.  \"WS people are just as needing as other people with mental disorders and in many ways they are more needing of support and attention, and that all comes at a price.\"  People with WS do not have a lower life expectancy than other people, and some may go on to get jobs, most often in a voluntary capacity, where their helpful nature can be useful.  Dr Debbie Riby, senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Durham University, has been working on the disorder for 12 years.  Anybody can have a child with Williams Syndrome\u201d She says WS occurs when part of chromosome seven is deleted, which happens sporadically.  \"Anybody can have a child with Williams Syndrome,\" she says.  Dr Riby says there is no pre-natal screening, but often doctors can pick up clues if a young child has heart murmurs, and problems putting on weight. She has been running parent focus groups to understand the anxiety side of WS to come up with practical steps families can take to help themselves keep their children calm and happy.  Dr Riby says: \"The work around Williams Syndrome used to focus on the theoretical side. I wanted to focus on the practical side. There is still an awful lot that we can do.  \"The most important thing is for us to think about how we can use research to support families.\"   ",

        "article": "A soldier who killed three colleagues and injured 16 others in a shooting at US Army base was being treated for depression and anxiety. He was also being assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Post-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder caused by witnessing or being involved in a frightening or distressing event. People naturally feel afraid when in danger, but the legacy of some traumatic events is a change in perception of fear. They may feel stressed or frightened in day-to-day life. Any traumatic event has the potential to lead to PTSD including: People will be generally affected within one month of the event.  There is no blood test for PTSD, it instead relies on the judgement of a doctor speaking to their patient about their symptoms. There must have been an initial traumatic event involving a close brush with death or serious violence.  There are then four criteria which must be present: \"This has to impair day-to-day function,\" said Neil Greenberg, a defence professor of mental health at the King's College London. \"With properly skilled doctors it can be very easy to diagnose, it could take a few hours,\" says Prof Greenberg. But he says doctors must have a good suspicion of PTSD before starting to diagnose someone, as patients may not bring up their trauma history. It can also be a challenge because some people deliberately \"overinflate symptoms\", sometimes for financial reasons, while others seek to avoid the stigma of a PTSD diagnosis.  For many people, the symptoms will go away within a month - but others will need psychotherapy or, if that fails, medication.  Cognitive behavioural therapy can help change the way people think about the traumatic event in order to control fear and anxiety. This involves going through the event in detail with a therapist. Antidepressants, such as paroxetine, are used if psychotherapy does not work. Prof Greenberg, who also works with the UK Psychological Trauma Society, says treatment is still effective many years after the incident. However, after such a long time the symptoms are very unlikely to clear up without treatment. ",

        "article": " as high air pollution levels are forecast.  But why does pollution cause problems, and what should people do? Winds have brought in pollutants from the Continent and dust from the Sahara, as well as \"home-grown\" pollution. Levels hit the maximum of 10 on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)  in Norfolk on Tuesday - meaning a \"very high\" risk of air pollution - and are expected to be high in parts of England on Wednesday. At level 10, adults and children with lung or heart problems, and older people, should avoid \"strenuous\" physical activity altogether - such as exercising outside in the afternoon when levels are particularly high. When the reading is between seven and nine, those with health and lung problems should reduce physical activity, and those with asthma may find they need to use their inhaler more frequently. Yes, if they experience symptoms. These are likely to be minor : But the advice is that anyone experiencing them should consider reducing outdoor activity. Quite simply because you are breathing in particles that are carried deep into the lungs which then irritate or inflame.  Those who are young and healthy are unlikely to suffer serious short-term effects. But long-term exposure can affect the respiratory system and contribute to heart disease, it is thought, by thickening the blood. Last year the World Health Organization (WHO) said air pollution was a potential cause of lung cancer. A recent WHO report calculated seven million people had died as a result of pollution - both indoor and outdoor - in 2012. Outdoor pollution was linked to: Pollution is a major problem in cities such as Beijing and Mexico City. ",

        "article": "Ebola fever has killed at least 86 people in Guinea in recent weeks and another six in Liberia. Firmin Bogon, who lives in Gueckedou near the borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone, told BBC Afrique how he lost his sister, his wife, his stepmother and other loved ones to the virus. My sister came to my home on her return from Sierra Leone and said she was unwell.  We took her to a hospital, where tests were carried out and people said she had typhoid fever. Doctors prescribed drugs but did not tell her to stay in hospital, so we treated her at home. Within a couple of days she passed away. Nobody knew it was contagious, and she was looked after by many people. She must have contaminated others even after her death, while her body was taken away for burial in the village and people had access to it. A few days later I noticed that several of those who had been near her had become ill. Then they started dying.  Her mum, who was staying with us, went first. Then my wife, who had looked after my sister, died as well.  In all we have now lost about 10 family members. My sister came to my home on 27 February and she died four days later. The others died in the five weeks since then. My sister had been in Sierra Leone where she spent less than a week, then in Kisidougou in Guinea, so it is not clear where she caught this disease. We only suspected an Ebola outbreak when a driver who was working for an aid agency in Macenta [in southern Guinea] died and tests on his remains were carried out.  They confirmed he had Ebola fever.  Only then did people start taking precautionary measures, but it was too late.  ",
