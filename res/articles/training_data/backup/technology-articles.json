        "article": "Some residents of Somalia's capital have been experiencing a form of \"culture shock\" since fibre optic services launched over the last week, an internet provider has told the BBC. \"Any video or site just pops up... they're very excited about the speed,\" Somalia Wireless's Liban Egal says. Until now access to the internet has been via dial-up or satellite links. Earlier this year, 3G mobile phone services were cut off because of a threat from Islamist militants. The al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab group issued a directive in January ordering all internet services to be stopped, saying those who did not comply would be seen as \"working with the enemy\" and dealt with according to Islamic law. Al-Shabab was driven out of the capital, Mogadishu, in August 2011, but still controls many smaller towns and rural areas in the south and centre of the country where they have imposed a strict version of Sharia. Following their threat, 3G networks nationwide were turned off but the project to launch fibre optic cable services continued in the capital, the BBC's Moalimu Mohammed reports from Mogadishu. He says the fibre optic connections, which have been rolled out over the last week by several internet providers, are only available in Mogadishu. People have been flocking to hotels and internet cafes to try out the fast service - some seeing video platforms like YouTube and social networking sites for the first time, our correspondent says. Mr Egal said the difference in speed was like the difference between \"day and night\". For those residents who have recently returned from the diaspora the development was a relief, he said. It was \"almost a culture shock\" for those who have never left Somalia, he added. He said the move would be a huge boost for the country, which is recovering from more than two decades of civil war. \"Every time a fibre optic cable is connected to a country they see their GDP [gross domestic product] going up because their communication costs go down,\" Mr Egal said. \"All life will be affected - businesses, the government, universities - they all will see the benefits.\"  Our reporter says the current security situation will limit the rollout of fibre optic services to the rest of the country. Since 1991 Somalia has seen clan-based warlords, rival politicians and Islamist militants battle for control - a situation that has allowed lawlessness to flourish. An African Union force has been helping the UN-backed government fight al-Shabab, which wants to create an Islamic state in Somalia. ",

        "article": "Spending lots of time on Facebook looking at pictures of friends could make women insecure about their body image, research suggests. The more women are exposed to \"selfies\" and other photos on social media, the more they compare themselves negatively, according to a study. Friends' photos may be more influential than celebrity shots as they are of known contacts, say UK and US experts. The study is the first to link time on social media to poor body image. The mass media are known to influence how people feel about their appearance. The attention to physical attributes may be even more dangerous on social media than on traditional media because participants in social media are people we know\u201d But little is known about how social media impact on self-image. Young women are particularly high users of social networking sites and post more photographs of themselves on the internet than do men. To look at the impact on body image, researchers at the University of Strathclyde, Ohio University and University of Iowa surveyed 881 female college students in the US. The women answered questions about their Facebook use, eating and exercise regimes, and body image.  The research, presented at a conference in Seattle, found no link with eating disorders. But it did find a link between time spent on social networks and negative comparisons about body image. The more time women spent on Facebook, the more they compared their bodies with those of their friends, and the more they felt negative about their appearance. \"Spending more time on Facebook is not connected to developing a bad relationship with food, but there is a connection to poor body image,\" Petya Eckler, of the University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow, told the BBC. She added: \"The attention to physical attributes may be even more dangerous on social media than on traditional media because participants in social media are people we know.  \"These comparisons are much more relevant and hit closer to home. Yet they may be just as unrealistic as the images we see on traditional media.\"  A spokesperson for the Beat eating disorders charity said body image was a key part of our sense of identity and not a trivial matter or personal vanity.  A preoccupation with weight and shape was one of the key features of current popular culture, and was a global phenomenon, she said.  \"The fascination with celebrities, their bodies, clothes and appearance has all increased the pressure that people typically feel at a time when they seek to establish their own identities and when their bodies are growing and changing,\" she said.  \"Young people compare themselves to the images that bombard them and feel it is their fault that their bodies compare so unfavourably.\" ",

        "article": "The US government has warned that it believes hackers are trying to make use of the Heartbleed bug. The Department of Homeland Security   for sites affected by the flaw once they had confirmed they were secure. However, an official added that there had not been any reported attacks or malicious incidents. The alert comes as several makers of net hardware and software revealed some of their products had been compromised. A German computer programmer has accepted responsibility for the emergence of the Heartbleed bug, according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald. Robin Seggelman, a 31 year old from Oelde - 120 miles (193km) north of Frankfurt - is reported to have made the mistake while trying to improve the OpenSSL cryptographic library on 31 December 2011. \"It's tempting to assume that, after the disclosure of the spying activities of the NSA and other agencies, but in this case it was a simple programming error in a new feature, which unfortunately occurred in a security-relevant area,\" he told Fairfax Media. \"It was not intended at all, especially since I have previously fixed OpenSSL bugs myself, and was trying to contribute to the project.\" Affected equipment includes network routers and switches, video conferencing kit, phone call software, firewalls and apps that let workers remotely access company data. The encryption flaw can potentially be exploited to steal passwords and secret keys used to protect computer users. Experts say home kit is less at risk. There had   that domestic home networking equipment - such as wi-fi routers - might also make use of unpatched versions of the OpenSSL cryptographic library used to digitally scramble sensitive data. However, a security researcher at the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory said he thought this would be a relatively rare occurrence. \"You would have to be a semi-professional to have this sort of equipment at home,\" Dr Richard Clayton told the BBC. \"It's unusual to find secure connections to a home router because you'd have to have a certificate in the device.  \"If that certificate were self-signed it would generate browser warnings. Alternatively, you could be regularly updated but that would cost money.\" UK internet service providers (ISPs) Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media confirmed that their home router suppliers had told them their equipment did not use OpenSSL. News of the Heartbleed bug emerged on Monday when Google Security and Codenomicon - a Finnish security company - revealed that a flaw had existed in OpenSSL for more than two years. This had made it possible to impersonate services and users, and potentially eavesdrop on data communications. Internet security firm Cloudfare has cast doubt over how great the danger posed by Heartbleed is, saying it has been unable to exploit the flaw to obtain the secret SSL keys that would put people's data at risk. The US company was one of those given early warning of the vulnerability before Monday's public announcement, and has had 12 days to carry out tests. \"Note that is not the same as saying it is impossible to use Heartbleed to get private keys,\"   leader Nick Sullivan. \"We do not yet feel comfortable saying that. However, if it is possible, it is at a minimum very hard.\" The news prompted   to lead with the headline: \"Heartbleed security flaw may not be as dangerous as thought\" But Codenomicon - the security firm that sounded the first alert - stands by its warning. \"We know what we found,\" chief executive David Chartier told the BBC. \"Access to memory is a very serious vulnerability and it's great that people are taking quick action to upgrade and remediate the problem. \"If you search on the internet you will find many people have replicated the problem.\" The flaw only exposed 64K of data at a time, but a malicious party could theoretically make repeated grabs until they had the information they wanted.   The website   noted that it was possible to carry out such an attack \"without leaving a trace\", making it impossible to know for sure if criminals or cyberspies had taken advantage of it. Media reports initially focused on the risk of logging into compromised online services such as webmail, cloud storage and banking, with some - but not all - companies suggesting users should reset their passwords. Warnings from companies including  ,  ,  ,   and   that some of their internet products are compromised may now place the spotlight on the corporate sector. Dr Clayton explained how such a hacker could take advantage of the problem. \"If you managed to log into a router then the simplest thing you could do would be to change the DNS [domain name system] settings in there,\" he said. \"Then you could arrange that everything on the internet resolves correctly apart from, for example, Barclays.com, which you could set to resolve to a malicious site that asks for the visitors' details.\" Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at the University of Surrey, gave another scenario in which hackers could take advantage of flaws in virtual private network software used to let workers log into corporate networks when not in the office. \"The worst case would be that they could reach in and see the keys,\" he said. \"Hence all the traffic going to and from remote workers that people thought was secure could potentially be decrypted. \"But you would be working through quite a few layers of things to get to that because the way OpenSSL is used is quite complicated.\" The US government has said that it was working with third-party organisations \"to determine the potential vulnerabilities to computer systems that control essential systems - like critical infrastructure, user-facing and financial systems\". Meanwhile, officials suggested members of the public should \"closely monitor your email accounts, bank accounts, social media accounts and other online assets for irregular or suspicious activity, such as abnormal purchases or messages\".  Media requires JavaScript to play. Rory Cellan-Jones looks at ways to manage strong online passwords The UK has given similar advice. \"People should take advice on changing passwords from the websites they use,\" said a Cabinet Office spokesman. \"Most websites have corrected the bug and are best placed to advise what action, if any, people need to take.\" ",

        "article": "A key member of a gang that traded stolen and fake credit cards could face years in jail after pleading guilty to racketeering charges.  Cameron Harrison of Georgia, US, was part of a large card fraud ring centred around the Carder.su website.  About $50m (\u00a330m) in losses have been attributed to the group that used the Carder.su site. The group was broken up by US law enforcement in 2012 and so far, 55 of its members have been charged.  The ring leaders of the group, which was run via Russia, are still believed to be at large.  The case is believed to be among the first to use racketeering laws against cybercriminals. Before now the laws were used against members of more traditional organised crime groups. Harrison, aka Kilobit, joined the group in 2008 and was instrumental in helping it steal credit cards, IDs and engage in financial fraud.  Documents filed by the US Department of Justice against Harrison show that he has been indicted under two counts of racketeering and one of making and selling fake ID documents.  US guidelines suggest he will face decades in prison when he is sentenced later this year because those rules inflate prison terms if a crime affects more than 250 victims or involves losses higher than $50m.  The US government is also seeking to make Harrison and other former Carder.su members pay $50m in restitution to the four credit card firms they stole from - Visa, Discover, American Express and MasterCard.

        "article": "A new burrowing robot for anchoring miniature submarines has been developed - inspired by the humble razor clam. \"RoboClam\" could be used to lay undersea cables, and potentially even destroy mines, its inventors say. The device mimics the digging action used by razor clams to turn solid soil into liquid \"quicksand\", helping them slide through. A prototype is   by engineers from MIT in Boston, US. The cool thing is this technology is already 10 times more efficient than any anchor\u201d They set out to design a new low-power, light-weight anchor for  \"Luckily, nature had already done the work for us,\" said Dr Kerstin Nordstrom, of the University of Maryland, who collaborated on the research. The answer was poking out of mudflats off the coast at nearby Gloucester, MA. The Atlantic razor clam,  , has been dubbed \"the Ferrari of underwater diggers\". An animal of its modest frame (10-20cm) should only be strong enough to penetrate 2cm into packed sand. But it can burrow up to 70cm in just over a minute. Compared to existing anchor technology \"the razor clam is about 10 times more efficient,\" Dr Nordstrom  . To dig for half a kilometre, it would only use the energy in an AA battery. \"But when you try plunging the shell into the sand, it doesn't actually penetrate very far,\" said Dr Nordstrom. \"What this shows is the clam must be actively doing something to the ground when it digs.\" To find out the razor clam's secret, they studied its digging action and modelled it mechanically. The repeated open-shut of the clam's valves turned the hard-packed soil around it into quicksand. \"The clam's trick is to move its shells in such a way as to liquefy the soil around its body, reducing the drag acting upon it,\" said Amos Winter, of MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering. \"Pushing through sand costs a lot of energy. But if the sand is excited, it's actually very easy. That's the trick,\" added Dr Nordstrom. By mimicking the action of the razor clam, they built their own robotic prototype - which has achieved the same digging speed - about 1cm per second. The first \"RoboClam\" can only reach 20cm, and requires a significant rig of machinery to propel it. But having demonstrated the principle, the team now aims to develop a larger, self-contained unit, that can burrow more than 10 metres. This could be used to anchor larger vessels, and may have military applications - such as detonating mines, the researchers suggest. \"The cool thing is this technology is already 10 times more efficient than any anchor. If we can keep scaling things up, some day it will affect big boats,\" said Dr Nordstrom. \"Also - undersea cable installation is happening more and more frequently. If we can do it more efficiently we can save costs and cause less disturbance to the environment,\" she said. Amos Winter agrees: \"Having a system that could just latch onto the cable, work its way along, and automatically dig it into the soil would be great,\" he said. ",

        "article": "Google is taking a stake in a Silicon Valley-based robotics company that has yet to reveal its first product. Savioke's work may be under wraps, but it   to begin customer trials of a service industry-targeted machine this year. Google has acquired eight other robotics companies outright over the past year. Its latest investment may be relatively small but experts say that it should boost confidence in the sector. Savioke has disclosed a total $2m (\u00a31.2m) of seed finance, which includes cash from other sources in addition to an undisclosed sum from Google Ventures, the search giant's investment arm. Savioke was only established last year. However, its chief executive, Steve Cousins, has previous experience in the sector, having launched the PR2 robot - a machine targeted at robotics software developers wishing to try out their code. \"We have decided that it is time for robots to become available widely in the service industry,\" Mr Cousins told the BBC. \"We're not ready to quite disclose what we are going to be doing, but we believe the technology is ripe and this industry is largely untapped. \"There's a few examples of robots in hospitals that are extensions of a surgeon, but what we are looking at is a little bit more what people traditionally think of as robots - autonomous entities that can do things on their own and can help people out.\" Although he declined to say which sectors would be targeted,   lists hotels, elderly care facilities, hospitals and restaurants as possibilities. Mr Cousins was keen to stress that the deal involved Google Ventures - a unit that operates independently of the rest of the California-based company and whose stated goal is to fund the \"best companies\" rather than ones that are strategic to Google's other operations. However, GV's previous stake in Nest ultimately resulted in Google paying $3.2bn to add the smart thermostat-maker to its main business, and Mr Cousins did not rule out the possibility of his company following a similar path. \"In the end, what we want to see is robots out in the world helping people,\" he said. \"So, whatever 'exit strategy' leads us to that goal is what we are all about.\" Google's interest in robotics was preceded by that of Amazon.  The web retailer paid $775m in 2012 to buy Kiva Systems, a company specialising in robots used to move goods in warehouses. Venture capitalists said the two big companies actions' were now fuelling interest from others. \"One of the big questions when you do a robotics deal had always been who is going to buy it if this thing doesn't go public,\" said tech investor Paul Kedrosky.  \"It was never obvious. Now that Amazon and Google have self-identified as acquirers, it makes doing robotics deals pretty exciting.\" Mike Maples, co-founder of Floodgate Ventures, agreed the sector had become more attractive. \"In the last few years, it has become clear that the computer industry is no longer primarily about computers - whether it's post-PC devices, internet of things, self-driving cars, wearables or robots - an entirely new digital industry is emerging where computers fade into the background but digital is everywhere,\" he said. \"Google's move into robotics will make it even more attractive to start-up investors because it accelerates the creation of a new category of opportunities.\" British engineering company Dyson recently announced that it was investing \u00a35m in a robotics lab at Imperial College London. One roboticist said he expected more deals would follow. \"It's pretty clear that with an ageing population there is a fantastic business opportunity for creating technology that is not only going to improve people's quality of life but also extend their working lives,\" said Prof Chris Melhuish, director of Bristol Robotics Laboratory.

Israeli start-up StoreDot displayed the device - made of biological structures - at Microsoft's Think Next Conference.  A Samsung S4 smartphone went from a dead battery to full power in 26 seconds in the demonstration. The battery is currently only a prototype and the firm predicts it will take three years to become a commercially viable product. In the demonstration, a battery pack the size of a cigarette packet was attached to a smartphone. \"We think we can integrate a battery into a smartphone within a year and have a commercially ready device in three years,\" founder Dr Dorn Myersdorf told the BBC. The bio-organic battery utilises tiny self-assembling nano-crystals that were first identified in research being done into Alzheimer's disease at Tel Aviv University 10 years ago. The nano-dots are  described by StoreDot as \"stable, robust spheres\" that are 2.1 nanometers in diameter and made up of peptide molecules. The technology has a range of uses,  founder Dr Myersdorf said. \"Batteries are just one of the industries we can disrupt with this new material. It is new physics, new chemistry, a new approach to devices,\" he said. The team has also used the nano-crystals in memory chips which could write three times faster than traditional flash memory and as a non-toxic alternative to cadmium in screens. Dr Myersdorf said that the batteries are likely to be 30 to 40% more expensive to manufacture compared to traditional ones and the final product will be twice as expensive than those on the market today. But making them should be a relatively easy process.  \"It is about letting nature take its course. We just need a facility that can do chemical processing,\" he said.  ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Rory Cellan-Jones tests out the Samsung S5 The Galaxy S5's new heart rate reader could come in useful for Samsung Electronic's investors. The South Korean firm warned earlier this week that it expected its profits to fall for the second quarter running.  Several analysts suggest the high-end market is becoming saturated, meaning most people wanting a premium phone already own one, making it harder to sell them another.  \"Year to date, the share price of Samsung Electronics continues to underperform both in absolute terms and against the Kospi [Korea Composite Stock Price Index] as well,\" Taewoo Kim, portfolio manager of Fidelity's Korea fund tells the BBC. \"This weak performance reflected investors' concerns on its smartphone business particularly in the high-end segment as a result of elevated competition.\" But Mr Kim believes things are about to improve, thanks in part to the improving performance of Samsung Electronic's memory and home appliance divisions. The new Galaxy could guarantee such a turnaround if consumers warm to its water-resistant build, improved camera and fitness-tracking facilities. To mark the S5's global launch the BBC asked five experts for their thoughts: Samsung has packed in all the latest technology to make this a powerhouse\u201d The Samsung Galaxy S5 plays it safe on design, sticking to a tried and tested formula with its plastic body and chrome-trimmed finish.  There's plenty of grip around the back and you still have the advantage of being able to change the battery, both to the phone's credit. Under the hood Samsung has packed in all the latest technology to make this a powerhouse.  There's raw processing power and battery performance to get you though the day, fronted by a stunning 5.1in (13cm) display, with a camera that offers nice vibrant photos and the option for 4K ultra-high definition video capture, ready for the next generation. But the implementation of the fingerprint scanner isn't as tidy as the iPhone and we're not convinced that the heart rate sensor was a feature that anybody was crying out for.  There is a huge number of features on offer making for a super-connected device, but we feel the user interface could be a little slicker and faster.  The Samsung Galaxy S5 is undoubtedly a great device, we're just not convinced it's the greatest. A heart rate monitor... is hard to see as much more than a gimmick\u201d The Samsung S5 launch was largely underwhelming and I think that most consumers will be hard pressed to tell the difference between the new phone and last year's model. Whereas handset launches used to have us on the edge of our seats, they have increasingly lost their wow factor.  This is symptomatic of the maturity of the smartphone market, where ground-breaking innovations are hard to come by.  Take the S5 - one of its headline features is a heart rate monitor, which is hard to see as much more than a gimmick.  It's true that consumers do use heart rate monitors for running and cycling, but these activities demand specialist devices that provide the constant monitoring required, rather than the one-off measurements offered by the S5. And this perhaps shows us where innovation will come from in the future, where the individual functions of the device are broken out into wearable devices and accessories that connect back into a smartphone.  Of course Samsung itself is not blind to this trend and spent almost an equal amount of time at the S5 launch talking about its new smartwatches and connected fitness band.  The smartphone isn't going away any time soon, but if you are looking for the latest innovations then look instead at the myriad of wearables and smart accessories that are starting to flood on to the market. [Samsung] hires the best and brightest from Korea and increasingly abroad\u201d Samsung Electronics is now the biggest tech company in the world by revenue, with leadership in many product categories.  However, its shares trade at a deep discount to peers on all metrics as investors worry about saturation of the high-end smartphone market and the increasing challenge from Chinese rivals. The company is the bellwether of South Korea and the jewel of the Samsung Empire, the largest and most important chaebol - meaning conglomerate - on the Korean peninsula generating hundreds of thousands of jobs.  It is still one of the most prestigious places in Korea to work for new college graduates and as such hires the best and brightest from Korea and increasingly abroad. We believe concerns around the handset business are well overdone.  Although we have seen the fortunes of Nokia, Blackberry and HTC change rapidly, this was all due to the huge shakeout in the smartphone revolution.  Now, we are settling down for a period of more incremental innovations, where scale and breadth wins. Similar to how Nokia dominated the featurephone era, Samsung will continue to dominate this new smartphone era. Beyond scale and breadth, the other massive difference between Samsung and other rivals is its vertical integration including internal manufacturing and core components such as memory, display, processors and batteries.  Together this gives Samsung access to the latest and greatest technologies much faster than competitors, and also allows Samsung to have the lowest cost position. In an era of increased commoditisation, Samsung's cost competitiveness will enable it to continue to make profits while others falter. Consumers are yearning for... more premium materials\u201d With Samsung poised to release its latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S5, there are some of us whose minds are already focused nearly a year down the road: on the presumed Galaxy S6. Unlike this past cycle, the South Korean giant will very likely be forced to make significant upgrades in the area of specifications. While the transition from the S4 to S5 involved only minor spec bumps, we'll probably see Samsung in a position of playing catch up with rival LG, whose upcoming G3 handset is rumoured to feature a higher resolution display.  Likewise, we should see a more substantial jump in processor speeds, as well as a move from 32-bit to 64-bit chip architecture - a choice which would help developers offer the same apps on disparate platforms. Samsung also has a growing problem it needs to address which has nothing to do with spec parity: consumers are yearning for the company to begin employing more premium materials like the aluminium of the HTC One or wood backs on the Moto X. Until Samsung is ready to take mass production to the next level - in the areas of software and hardware alike - there is always going to be a relatively easy marketing strategy rivals can employ to capture market share. Samsung is driven by strong execution- oriented culture\u201d While many Chinese players rush to introduce low-end smartphones at a half or even one-third of the prices of Samsung's, Samsung will not easily lose its market share.   Samsung has invested a lot on its brand for many years and is now considered as cool and sharp among its dedicated users - although not as loyal as Apple's.   Samsung is also trying very hard to create differentiation-based advantages by offering complementary products and services such as wearable pieces, contents and software.   If home electronics networks - including freezers, air-conditioning, washing machines - become a reality in the near future, it will be in the best position to integrate all the devices. While I expect Samsung will not easily lose market share to its competitors, its profit margin will be severely under pressure.  It has already expanded its product offerings in the medium to low-end segments, which will affect its pricing in the high-end segment.  Yet, Samsung is driven by strong execution-oriented culture, and will remain competitive in the future.\" ",

        "article": "This week it has emerged that a major security flaw at the heart of the internet may have been exposing users' personal information and passwords to hackers for the past two years. It is not known how widely the bug has been exploited, if at all, but what is clear is that it is one of the biggest security issues to have faced the internet to date. Security expert Bruce Schneier described it as \"catastrophic\".  He said: \"On the scale of one to 10, this is an 11.\"  The BBC has attempted to round up everything you need to know about Heartbleed. The bug exists in a piece of open source software called OpenSSL which is designed to encrypt communications between a user's computer and a web server, a sort of secret handshake at the beginning of a secure conversation. It was dubbed Heartbleed because it affects an extension to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) which engineers dubbed Heartbeat. It is one of the most widely used encryption tools on the internet, believed to be deployed by roughly two-thirds of all websites. If you see a little padlock symbol in your browser then it is likely that you are using SSL. Half a million sites are thought to have been affected. In chief technology officer of Co3 Systems Bruce Schneier said:  \"The Heartbleed bug allows anyone to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the name and passwords of the users and the actual content,\" he said. \"This allows attackers to eavesdrop communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users,\" he added. The bug is so serious it has its own website  which outlines all aspects of the problem. Some security experts are saying that it would be prudent to do so although there is a degree of confusion as to when and if this needs to be done. Many of the large technology firms including Facebook and Google have patched the vulnerability.  Confusingly though Google spokeswoman Dorothy Chou specifically said: \"Google users do not need to change their passwords.\" A source at the firm told the BBC that it patched the vulnerability ahead of the exploit being made public and did not believe that it had been widely used by hackers. Some point out that there will be plenty of smaller sites that haven't yet dealt with the issue and with these a password reset could do more harm than good, revealing both old and new passwords to any would-be attacker. But now the bug is widely known even smaller sites will issue patches soon so most people should probably start thinking about resetting their passwords. \"Some time over the next 48 hours would seem like sensible timing,\" the University of Surrey's computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward told the BBC. Mikko Hypponen of security firm F-Secure issued similar advice: \"Take care of the passwords that are very important to you. Maybe change them now, maybe change them in a week. And if you are worried about your credit cards, check your credit card bills very closely.\"  Media requires JavaScript to play. Rory Cellan-Jones looks at ways to manage strong online passwords The exploit was not related to weak passwords but now there are calls for a mass reset of existing ones, many are reiterating the need to make sure they are as secure as possible. People should regularly change their passwords, said Prof Woodward, and they need to make sure that they choose something that does not relate to themselves, such as a pet's name. Words that don't appear in a dictionary are preferable as is a mixture of words and numbers. For people whose attitude to passwords is to reset them each time they visit a site because they have forgotten them, there is help on hand. Tools are now widely available that will store and organise all your passwords and PIN codes for computers, apps and networks. They can also generate passwords and can automatically enter your username and password into forms on websites. Such tools store your passwords in an encrypted file that is accessible only through the use of a master password.  Examples of such services include KeePass, LastPass and 1Password. Some firms are starting to offer alternatives to passwords. Mobile firms including Apple and Samsung are integrating fingerprint-readers which allow users to access their phone and certain functions on it just by swiping their finger on the screen. There are half a million believed to be vulnerable so too many to list but there is a glut of new sites offering users the chance to check whether the online haunts they use regularly are affected.   has compiled a list as has new website  . Meanwhile security firm Kaspersky directs people to the  While Facebook and Google say that they have patched their services, according to the   there is a long list of sites that are still vulnerable, including Flickr, OkCupid and Github. One of the biggest tech firms remaining on the vulnerable list was Yahoo but, as of last night, it too seemed to have remedied the problem saying it \"had made the appropriate corrections across our entire platform\". Many more sites will spend the coming days scrambling to do the same. Bruce Schneier called on internet companies to issue new certificates and keys for encrypting internet traffic. Doing so would render stolen keys useless, he said. More of a cock-up than a conspiracy\u201d The bad news, according to   is that \"exploiting Heartbleed leaves no traces so there is no definitive way to tell if the server was hacked and what kind of data was stolen\". Security experts say that they are starting to see evidence that hacker groups are conducting automated scans of the internet in search of web servers using OpenSSL. And Kaspersky said that it had uncovered evidence that groups believed to be involved in state-sponsored cyber-espionage were running such scans shortly after news of the bug broke. The bug was first spotted by Google Security and a Finnish security firm Codenomicon which said that it was introduced by a programming error. Because OpenSSL is open source, researchers were able to study the code in detail which is why it was found in the first place. But such code libraries are immensely complex so it can take some time for those who routinely examine the code to come across such problems. \"It was such an unexpected problem that it wasn't something that researchers would necessarily have been looking for,\" Prof Woodward told the BBC. There is no direct evidence although lots of speculation that there is a link after details emerged that the National Security Agency (NSA) explored ways to break encryption.  GCHQ simply said it had a \"longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters\". And many seemed to think that the problem was down to bad code rather than anything more sinister. \"More of a cock-up than a conspiracy,\" said Prof Woodward, who has undertaken consultancy work for GCHQ.

Its predecessor, Solar Impulse 1, has already been flown across America, and stored sufficient power in its batteries to fly all night.    With a wingspan of 72m (236ft), Solar Impulse 2 is the width of a Boeing 747, but weighs about the same as a large car.  Its wings are covered in 18,000 solar cells to convert sunlight into electricity to power its motor and to store in its batteries.  The Switzerland-based team will make the attempt next year. Andre Borschberg, one of the pilots and co-founder of Solar Impulse, showed BBC News the brand new craft and explained how it has been designed to allow a pilot to spend up to five days alone in the cockpit.
