McIlroy's unlucky sprinkler shot at 13     Watson has only ever won one of eight tournaments he has led at the halfway stage, but if McIlroy is to win, he will need to close the biggest deficit in Masters history - an eight stroke come back by Jack Burke in 1956 is the current best.\n     In pursuit of American Watson, Britain's best-placed players going into the weekend are Welshman \n     \n     and Scotland's \n     \n     who both sit on one under par.\n     Gallacher, a Masters debutant, birdied the par-five 15th as he ended the day on the same mark as he started. \n     The 39-year-old hit 12 of 14 fairways from the tee, but admitted he was \"glad to still be in the red numbers\" after a round which included four bogeys.\n     \"You've got to keep your temperament,\" said Gallacher. \"Your acceptance levels here have got to be through the roof, you've just got to hit it, accept it and get on with it. \n     The four par five holes on Augusta National played as the easiest on the golf course on day two. In all, 143 of the 290 birdies on the second day came on these holes, with leader Bubba Watson picking up shots on the back nine's two par fives\n     \"It's a very strategic course. I think everyone at home knows how to play it but it's just a case of trying to do it.\"\n     Donaldson described his standing at six shots behind Watson as \"a good position\", but acknowledged he has \"to try to hit more fairways\" over the weekend after finding just 14 of 28 so far. \n     On day two of the tournament, Augusta National's four par five holes played the easiest statistically, with 143 of the day's 290 birdies and seven eagles arriving on the quartet.\n Welshman Jamie Donaldson missed the cut in his debut Masters appearance in 2013\r\n        \n     was unable to capitalise on their generosity for the second day running and finished one under par for the day and level for the tournament.\n     \"I didn't play the par fives well enough again,\" said 40-year-old Westwood who is still searching for a first major title. \"Over two days, I've made eight fives and that's where you make your scores. You need birdies over the weekend on them. \n     \"There's good scores if you play well and disasters if you start hitting a few wild shots. I'm comfortable out there and can see a way around it.\"\n     US Open champion \n     \n     and fellow Englishman \n     \n     both carded scores of 70 on day two to move to two over for the tournament.\n     The 11th hole, named White Dogwood, played the hardest on the course for the second day. A par four, it is averaging more than 4.5 shots and claimed 37 bogeys and 10 double bogeys on Friday. \n     \"That was one of the best rounds I have had at Augusta in terms of ball striking, but I finish disappointed because I left shots on the course,\" said Poulter.\n     \"I three-putted at 10 and at 14. I know I am playing well, my scores are not reflecting that but they are coming and I need to stay patient.\"\n     Elsewhere, Northern Ireland's \n     \n    conceded \"Augusta is still a work in progress\" for him after missing the cut along with England's \n     \n ",

        "article": "    There is a standard protocol now when watching Mo Farah in big races: let him pick his way through the early skirmishes, wait for him to seize the lead just before the bell and then roar him home as the world's best distance runners flap and flutter in his slipstream.\n     Six times in the last two and a half years Farah has won gold in that fashion, from Korea to Moscow and, most memorably of all, in Stratford's Olympic Stadium. Which will make it all the more unsettling for some to learn that, on his return to the capital for \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     he will be running as a novice.\n     You can forecast a man's 5,000m chances in big championships on his performance in the heats. You can gauge his 10,000m hopes on precedent and form. \n     The marathon? A long, purgatorial run into virgin territory. \n     There is no precedent. There is no science to predict what might happen. Farah has run 26.2 miles in training. But he has never covered it at race pace, on asphalt, with rivals pushing and breaking, the course twisting and climbing, emergency sirens wailing from muscle, joint and lung.\n      \n    Dennis Kimetto (Ken) - Berlin 2012 \n      \n    Ayele Abshero (Eth) -  Dubai 2012 \n      \n    Tsegaye Mekonnen (Eth) - Dubai 2014 \n      \n    Lelisa Desisa (Eth) - Dubai 2013 \n      \n    Bernard Koech (Ken) - Dubai 2013 \n      \n    Kenenisa Bekele (Eth, above) - Paris 2014 \n     And that, for a nation grown accustomed to his peerless track triumphs, may take some getting used to.\n     \"It's inevitable with everything Mo has achieved so far that people are going to expect that he wins it,\" says Paula Radcliffe, the \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and Farah's friend and advisor since his schooldays in Hounslow.\n     \"He could have a really good run and not win it. It doesn't mean he's run badly, but trying to convey that to other people is difficult because he has done so much. He has achieved so much that people expect every time he steps out he's going to win.\"\n     Last weekend the only other man to pull off the world and Olympic distance double-double, Kenenisa Bekele, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     in Paris.\n     That was in a race where he was untroubled by rivals or their tactics. In contrast to that tailor-made itinerary, Farah has chosen to make his own bow on the most public stage of all, against the best field London has ever assembled.\n     There is \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     There is world-record holder Wilson Kipsang, and course record holder Emmanuel Mutai, and Olympic and world champion Stephen Kiprotich. There will be no hiding place, no respite, no easy ride. \n Farah has a close affinity with the London Marathon\r\n       Farah understands the dimensions of his task. Ever since he moved from student digs in St Mary's in Twickenham to a shared house with Kenya's distance elite back in 2004, spending his evenings watching old VHS cassettes of track greats and marathon classics, he has been the most willing student of his specialised subject.\n     But even as his body language at his pre-race media interviews appeared bashful - half-sentences, shy grins, lean limbs hidden under baggy grey tracksuit bottoms and an over-sized white T-shirt - his mood was bullish.\n     \"I've gone straight in the deep end, but that's what champions do. London is by far the toughest field anyone has seen. It makes me more of a champion for going out there and going straight in.\"\n     Farah's ascent to the elite is intimately entwined with this race. Three times as a teenager he won the mini-marathon, the three-mile race for kids aged from 11-17 that precedes the main event at its Mall finish; after leaving school in 2001, it was a London Marathon scholarship that paid for him to join the newly established endurance performance centre at St Mary's rather than join the army, as he feared he would have to.\n     In making his debut this year he is being richly rewarded. Yet he is also paying something back, revitalising interest in the elite side of the race for a public that haven't been drawn to it with as much curiosity since Radcliffe's record-breaking deeds a decade ago. \n     Outside of hardcore athletics fans, most people have grown to think of the London Marathon as friends and fancy dress rather than unmissable sporting drama.\n     The uncertainty about his performance only multiplies the fascination. How fast can he go? What would constitute success?\n      \n     Emmanuel Mutai (Ken) - 2011\n      \n     Wilson Kipsang (Ken) - 2012\n      \n     Sammy Wanjiru (Ken) - 2009\n      \n     Martin Lel (Ken) - 2008\n      \n     Tsegaye Kebede (Eth) - 2010\n     It is notoriously difficult to compare marathons run on different days on different courses, so Bekele's two hours, five minutes and three seconds in Paris may provide only limited guidance; while it is worth noting that the Ethiopian's bests over 5,000m and 10,000m are 16 and 29 seconds faster than Farah's, those PBs were set a long time ago, and the pair were only separated by hundredths of a second over the half-marathon distance of the Great North Run last September.\n     The man whose distance records Bekele beat, Haile Gebrselassie, ran 2:06:35 on his own London debut in 2002, at the time the fastest debut in history. His great track rival Paul Tergat had clocked 2.08:15 in London the year before. \n     Neither do those two provide a perfect prediction for Farah this Sunday, but they do offer context: Farah could run brilliantly, beat the great Haile's debut and yet still finish fourth.\n     What gives those close to him such confidence - there were whispers this week that he is in shape to dip under 2:05 with benevolent weather and a little luck - is that he comes to London off the same formula that has made him the preeminent track runner of his era.\n     Farah is no longer the callow, talented yet capricious kid who struggled to convert his ability into major medals in the early part of his career. He is in supreme physical shape, the product of his usual winter at altitude in Iten, Kenya, with the solid self-belief of a multiple champion to match.\n     In coach Alberto Salazar he has a man who knows more about marathon training than anyone else in the world. Just as importantly, Farah, after the unparalleled success the pair have enjoyed together since 2011, takes confidence in everything he advises.\n     While this is 40,000 steps into the unknown, it is no wild punt. With no World Championships or Olympics this year, Farah can test himself over the ultimate challenge without jeopardising his track status or future goals.\n     Wilson Kipsang (Ken) \n     \n    - Berlin, 2013\n     Patrick Makau (Ken) \n     \n     - Berlin, 2011\n     Dennis Kimetto (Ken) \n     \n     - Chicago, 2013\n     Emmanuel Mutai (Ken) \n     \n     - Chicago, 2013\n     Haile Gebrselassie (Eth)\n     \n     - Berlin, 2008\n     If it works, he may think about a 10,000m/marathon double at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, just as Salazar hinted to me that he would in the aftermath of 2012. If it fails, he can return to the track in time to keep his speed over the shorter stuff. \n     \"With a marathon, it is about racing, to see how you cope with the distance and how your body copes with it,\" says Radcliffe, who has no fears that Farah's springy track style might not convert to the heavy demands of the road.\n     \"It is refreshing for him to have a new and different challenge. He'll probably still be successful on the track, if not more successful than he has been, with the marathon training behind him, but this gives him a chance to do something a little bit different. Yes, it's challenging, but I think he will be relishing the fact that it is a new stimulus for him.\"\n     Gebrselassie will be back on London's streets on Sunday as the elite field's pacemaker, driving them along at close to record pace over the first 30km (18.5 miles). Farah, who will run without a watch (\"I'll just go with the feeling\"), will want to conserve as much energy as he can in that time, for once letting other athletes dictate, staying safe until at least 18 miles and the multiple assaults that will surely follow.\n     \"In the marathon you really do have to run your own race,\" says Radcliffe, 11 years on from setting her own unsurpassed world record of 2:15.25 on the same course. \n     \"You have to cover moves and be aware of what others are doing, but you also have to do what's right for your body and do what suits you best. And that's tricky when you haven't run one before.\"\n     Farah already has the British records at 1500m, 5,000m and 10,000m. The 29-year-old marathon mark of Steve Jones (2:07:13) is realistically in sight this weekend. Beyond that the boundaries are less certain. London will feel a foreign land.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Mo Farah ready for London Marathon debut ",

Interview - Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara     The game initially had to accept second billing, since the competition was between the two sets of supporters and their goading of each other. The noise spilled from the Ibrox stands as if oblivious to events on the pitch.\n     There was soon a hectic urgency to the play, though, and composure was an early victim of the heightened atmosphere. There were pent-up emotions to be released, and the quality of the game suffered from the raucous surroundings.\n     There was excitement and zeal as the two sets of players hared around the Ibrox pitch, but not enough self-control to bring some poise to the proceedings. \n     Rangers had the most cause to rue that lack of restraint, since they should have opened the scoring when Dean Shiels was sent through on goal. The forward hurried his finish, though, and scuffed the ball wide.\n     It became a galling miss for Rangers, because minutes later a hopeful Gavin Gunning header sent Armstrong clear. \n     Nadir Ciftci was returning from an offside position but was deemed not to be interfering with play and Armstrong took advantage of the confusion to clip a shot past Simonsen that kissed a post before nestling in the net. \n     A pattern was established, since Rangers had the better patches of play, but could not influence the outcome.\n Armstrong (left) beat the offside trap to put United ahead\r\n       When Fraser Aird was free in the area, he laid the ball back to Jon Daly, only for the striker to direct a shot rashly over the bar.\n     Moments later, Richard Foster failed to clear his lines and allowed Ryan Gauld to burrow into the Rangers penalty area before shunting into the path of Armstrong. He could not connect cleanly and neither, subsequently, could Mackay-Steven, but the ball looped off Bilel Mohsni, over Simonsen, and into the net.\n     Smith restored some hope for Rangers with a free-kick that squeezed between Radoslaw Cierzniak and the base of his left-hand post. \n     That goal came just before half-time and, athough Rangers continued to enjoy greater possession after the interval, their frailties could not be disguised.\n     Mohsni was often hapless in possession, attacks were intermittent and haphazard in nature, and there was not enough link-up play between the midfield and the forwards.\n     United's midfield struggled to retain possession, and their defence often sat too deep, but their four front players were a constant threat, not least because of the calamities that the Rangers defence were capable of.\n     When Foster broke up one move and passed back to Simonsen, the goalkeeper hesitated before stubbing the ball straight at Ciftci. The striker rounded the stricken goalkeeper and was celebrating even before he rolled the ball into the empty net.\n     Rangers restored something of their reputation with this display, but United were the more clinical side.\n           Match ends, Rangers 1, Dundee United 3.

Who will triumph in title showdown?     \"We will unleash the supporters yet again on our opponents,\" said Rodgers. \n     \"I sense a real nostalgia about the place, a feeling of the old Liverpool. It will drive us, not hold us back.\"\n     Liverpool won the league championship 11 times between 1972 and 1990, when they won the last of their 18 titles.\n     The Reds, who have five games remaining, take a four-point advantage over third-placed City into Sunday's game, but the 2011-12 champions have two games in hand. \n     Rodgers, whose side have a 100% home record this season against the four top-seven teams they have faced, said securing a Champions League place remains the priority because of the financial reward it brings.\n     \"Liverpool have been playing to a really high tempo at home and I would expect them to do that again. It will be interesting to see how City deal with that because they have not coped too well when teams have pressed them like that this season.\"\n     But he added: \"If we can continue to play well and get a little bit of luck then hopefully we can make [the fans'] dreams come true. We will give it absolutely everything.\"\n     Rodgers, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     has no new injury concerns ahead of Sunday's game, although left-back Jose Enrique remains absent with a long-term knee injury.\n     Argentina striker Sergio Aguero will be available for City for the first time since their \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     in the Champions League on 12 March.\n     Manager Manuel Pellegrini does not believe the game will \"decide the title\".\n     The Chilean added: \"Of course, the team that wins this game has more chance to win the title, but if you think that, with this you finish [and win] the Premier League, it is a mistake.\n     \"There are a lot of other chances to continue fighting, because I think this year the title will be decided by just one point at the end of the season.\"\n  Media requires JavaScript to play.

But I'm not really sharp.\" \n     Ahead of the Masters, Mickelson - champion in 2004, 2006 and 2010 - had played 22 rounds of competitive golf in 2014, but \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     in late March with a muscle injury.\n     He tied 12th at the Houston Open one week ago but after finishing four over on day one at Augusta, disaster struck on the 155 yard 12th.\n     \"At 12 I hit the front bunker and there was no sand where I was at,\" said the world number five, who has only missed the cut at Augusta on one other occasion, in 1997. \n     \"I caught the liner of the bunker and bladed it across the green and the same thing happened on the other side. It went back and forth, three bunkers, before I finally got it to stay on the grass.\n     Only Gary Player (23), Fred Couples (23), Tom Watson (21), Gene Littler (19), Bernhard Langer (19), Billy Casper (18) and Tiger Woods (17) have made more consecutive cuts at Augusta than Phil Mickelson \n     \"What I've been nervous about is having a hole like seven on Thursday, a hole like 12 today, where I go along making pars and putting the ball in the right spot and you just get a bad situation.\n     \"I didn't play great. I didn't play bad.  I just had one bad hole there at 12. And I keep making these triples, they're tough to overcome.\" \n     The 12th, a picturesque par three, claimed 34 shots from the field on Friday, with Mickelson's six the worst score of the day on what was the seventh toughest hole.\n     After his exit, the tournament will play out a weekend without Mickelson and Tiger Woods for the first time since 1994, with 2012 champion \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Spain's Sergio Garcia, England's Luke Donald and former champions Charl Schwartzel and Ernie Els also finished on five over and exit the tournament at the midway point.\n     The Augusta course again averaged more than 74 strokes for the field and only 14 of the players to make the cut start Saturday under par. \n ",

Hell yeah,\" said Bradley. \"I was thinking, 'I don't want to box anymore - I don't even want to live anymore'.\"\n     The 30-year-old American, who is undefeated in 32 fights, received hate mail, death threats and abuse at petrol stations following his last meeting with Pacquiao.\n     The rematch (at approx 04:00 BST on Sunday) will be at the same venue, the MGM Grand, and Bradley says he has overcome his demons with the help of his family.\n     \"I realised the important things in my life, realised who was important,\" said Bradley, who absorbed brutal punishment but emerged with a 12-round unanimous decision over Ruslan Provodnikov in his first defence of the title, then won a 12-round split decision over Juan Manuel Marquez. \n     \"It doesn't affect me. I know who I am. I'm a great fighter.\"\n     In the build-up to his second meeting with 35-year-old Pacquiao, Bradley has questioned his opponent's hunger.\n     Pacquiao has been fighting as a professional since 1995 and has 55 wins and five losses from 62 fights but, despite \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     last November, some believe the Filipino's best days are behind him.\n     Prior to the Rios fight, he \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     the first time he had been stopped since 1999.\n     \"I think he may lack fire,\" Bradley said. \"His motivation is not there.

They are given guidance as to what they should do for disabled supporters and how many spaces they should provide but this isn't being followed.\n     \"The problem is that the clubs aren't being made to follow it, and neither the FA nor the Premier League has any rules telling them what the minimum standard should be. As a result, the experience of a disabled fan varies greatly from ground to ground.\n     \"Football showed in the wake of Hillsborough and the move to all-seater stadiums that it is capable of drastic action.  However, until clubs are forced to follow these guidelines, wide-scale change in this case appears unlikely.\"\n     Penning said a complete overhaul of grounds was required, \"starting at the very top\".\n     He added: \"The situation is currently woefully inadequate and it is not only wheelchair access that falls short, but access for people with all kinds of impairments.\"\n     Guidelines on how football clubs in the UK should cater for disabled spectators have been in place since 2004. \n     The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     sets out minimum standards that all new grounds have to meet in the provision, location, and quality of facilities for disabled fans. The number of wheelchair spaces a stadium should provide is based on its capacity. \n     Since the implementation of the Equality Act in 2010, and legislation dating back to 1995, it has been illegal for service providers, including football clubs, to treat disabled people less favourably than other customers.\n     Clubs can be ordered to make reasonable adjustments, which can include providing induction loops for those with hearing impairments, audio-description facilities for those with sight impairments and free tickets for carers who accompany disabled fans at games.\n     The Premier League insist they are following the existing regulations, and said: \"The Accessible Stadia Guide sets out agreed standards to be achieved when new grounds are designed or existing grounds rebuilt, however all clubs use those standards to assess existing provisions and guide them on how to make improvements.\n     \"Particular attention is given to achieving stadium management solutions that make the best of the constraints and opportunities inherent in each stadium. This includes working with the fans to arrive at solutions that work for them, and providing special training for stewards and staff to ensure that appropriate assistance is given.\" \n     Joyce Cook, chair of \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     formerly known as the National Association of Disabled Supporters, added: \"The experience of disabled football fans varies across the country. That's not acceptable and it's time all football clubs took their legal obligations seriously.\"\n ",

Even when I've run a personal best I've still gone through rough spots.\n     \"It's important not to panic and to keep focused. Use little techniques to make yourself think about the moment, whether it's singing to yourself, counting landmarks or counting in your head - anything. \n     \"I used to count to 100 three times in my head and I knew that was roughly a mile.\n     \"That helped me break down the mile into smaller chunks so instead of thinking 'I've got 12 miles left', you're just counting 'one, two, three...' and that's all you're thinking about. You will disappear into your own little world.\n     \"There will be times when you start questioning yourself and it's during those times you must think back to the preparation you've done. Nine times out of 10 the race is much easier than your longest training run. You're rested, you're fresher and you have the support of the crowd, use their energy.\n     \"Have an idea of what time you want to do but if you're feeling better than expected, throw that out of the window, and, equally, if you're feeling rough, stop looking at the clock and concentrate on completing the race.\"\n      \n     \"Last year I was asked what kept me going and I replied by saying \n    \r\n  \r\n\n    ' I was joking, of course. \n     \"I run in an orange bib and on the back it says 'oldest marathon runner' so when I'm walking along I get a tap on the shoulder from people asking me how old I am. By the time I've done four or five miles I've got bruises from all the tapping!\n     \"But it's a case of taking one mile at a time. My running days are over. It's hard for me these days, I am almost down to walking pace, but what keeps me going is\n    \r\n  \r\n\n     I'm running for and the thought of my friends and family at the finishing line.\"\n      \n     \"I used to sing Eurythmics's \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     because the beat of that is really good for maintaining a good average speed. \n     \"Wheelchair racing is a bit more like cycling. It's more like a stage race in the Tour de France, completely different to running the London Marathon. \n     \"In wheelchair races you're more likely to have a pack race and I would always try to stay in the pack, mainly because I was a stronger sprinter and I used to find racing on my own really hard. If I was on my own that's when the Eurythmics song would come in. \n     \"If you're in a pack there's loads of stuff to think about, like breakaways, and there's a lot of protection being in the pack, because of slipstreaming and protection from the wind, so there's no time to sing or count.\"\n      \n     \"Being positive is important to cope with the rigours of a marathon. However, being overly positive can often result in an unrealistic belief that the marathon will be entirely positive. Being confident in your ability is crucial but you do not want to be arrogant.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Need the toilet? Prof Whyte's essential marathon tips     \"Most people become emotional during a marathon. When you are pushing your body and mind to their limits for such a long period of time it is inevitable, and acceptable, that emotions play a part. \n     \"Hitting the wall is the culmination of a number of factors but primarily it happens when you are very low on energy, usually carbohydrates.

Great journeys are made with small steps.\"\n      \n     \"It's tough going from a team event like rowing, where everybody knows when you're not giving 100%, to an individual event where it's only you who knows if you're not giving 100%.\n     \"You know the pain will hit you at some point and it's down to you how much you're prepared to give. \n     \"I usually take a pair of headphones with me, but not to listen to music, it's just so that nobody talks to me. They think I'm listening to music and it gives me the excuse not to be rude and to blank everything out. \n     \"Also, when you look around there are people who clearly look in pain. There's always someone else who is in more pain so that can be a reassurance during the tough moments.\"\n      \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \n     \"Different people want different things out of the marathon but you don't have to run around with your eyes popping out like organ stops.

Try energy drinks before the race and, if you don't like them, just regard them as medicine. \n     \"And if you are trapped among people, don't weave through them, conserve your energy and just relax. The most important night sleep is the Friday to Saturday before the race. If you are lying in bed, tossing and turning on the Saturday night don't panic because it won't affect you too much.\n     \"The challenge for me is to say I have run all the London Marathons in under three hours. It won't be easy because I have a niggling hamstring injury, but I will definitely finish. Two years ago I ran across America and if I can do that then I can do the London Marathon.

        "article": "    In his regular BBC Sport tactics column, Robbie Savage looks at \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Both teams are attack-minded and high-scoring with exciting forward players, and both have weaknesses in defence, despite City's recent improvement at the back.\n     So the battle for control of the game in midfield will be vital at Anfield, particularly how each team tries to protect their back four.\n Signing of the season? Fernandinho joined City from Shakhtar Donetsk for \u00a330m in the summer of 2013\r\n       For Manchester City, Fernandinho is seen as their main defensive midfielder, but there is much more to his game than that.\n     His energy will be vital for Manuel Pellegrini's men, not just when it comes down to winning the ball back from Liverpool, but also in turning defence into attack.\n     I sometimes hear people describe Fernandinho as being an anchor man in the mould of former Chelsea star Claude Makelele, because they think Yaya Toure is the City midfielder who gets forward.\n     But in fact Fernandinho and Toure work in tandem as a pair of box-to-box players. They have got a great partnership because they share defensive and attacking responsibilities in City's usual 4-2-3-1 formation.\n     It is Toure who grabs the headlines because of his rampaging runs but Fernandinho is an unsung hero for City because of the energy he brings to their team, his mobility, and the amount of work he puts in.\n     Defensively, Fernandinho covers a lot of ground when City do not have possession and puts the most pressure on the ball. If you add up interceptions and tackles, he has won it back more than any other City player this season.\n Stats: Opta 1. Fernandinho (58) 1. Yaya Toure (177) 2. Martin Demichelis (47) 2. Fernandinho (155) 3. Pablo Zabaleta (45) 3. Vincent Kompany (111)     In contrast to Steven Gerrard, who does play the holding role for Liverpool, Fernandinho does not just turn over possession by sitting in front of his defence. Instead, he goes hunting for the ball.\n     In the past, Gerrard would have covered the same amount of ground as the 28-year-old Brazilian - who chases teams down, often high up the pitch - but these days he stays much deeper, apart from at set-pieces.\n     Like City, Liverpool look to get lots of players forward quickly when they win the ball but, on Sunday, Gerrard will not be one of them. He only enters the final third for set-pieces, from which he has provided seven of his nine assists and his three goals that have not come from the penalty spot. \n     It is different for Toure and Fernandinho. When you play with two box-to-box men in the middle like City do, they have to be disciplined. When one goes forward, the other has to stay - even if they probably both want to go.\n     Getting that balance right at Anfield will be vital for City and not just because of the different threats Liverpool pose.\n     Fernandinho and Toure will have to help their defence deal with the Reds' fast forwards when they break, watch for their overlapping full-backs and also put pressure on Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho, who will be looking to ping longer balls over and through City's back-line.\n Stats: Opta Games & Minutes 26 & 2,220 29 & 2,450 Goals/Shots 4/22 13/40 (10 pens) Assists 3 9 Chances created 31 57 Passes (% completed) 1,394 (88%) 1,832 (86%) Tackles (% won) 78 (78%) 79 (71%)     The City pairing have attacking responsibilities, too. Toure's main threat is through his trademark runs forward and shots from distance. Fernandinho is less spectacular but he is fast, good on the ball, able to pick out a pass and can burst into the box to get on the end of moves as well.\n     The most crucial thing about Fernandinho, though, is that the high-tempo he helps to set allows City to launch fast attacks of their own.\n     \r\n  \r\n\n     but the same could be said about Fernandinho for City.\n Stats: Opta Games 26 5 29 4 Wins 21 1 21 2 Defeats 3 2 3 2 Goals for 80 4 80 10 Av. goals for 3.08 0.8 2.75 2.5 Win % 81% 20% 72% 50% Points per game 2.5 1 2.3 1.5     When City win the ball and go forward, they move it about quickly, sometimes taking only one touch to lay it into the path of a team-mate and breaking into the box at devastating speed.\n     Fernandinho does not try to play searching long passes forward like Gerrard does. Instead, his job when he gets the ball back is to quickly push forward himself or immediately give it to a player ahead of him - David Silva or Samir Nasri, or one of City's overlapping full-backs.\n     That is what they will try to do against Liverpool, and City do not always attack at the same breathtaking speed when Fernandinho is not there - \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Martin Demichelis was in midfield and he took too many touches, which slowed City down.\n     City have failed to score in four of the five league games that Fernandinho has missed this season. They are the only times they have not found the net this season.\n     One of the factors behind Liverpool's success this season has been \n    \r\n  \r\n\n      and how he mixes up his midfield and attack depending on the opposition.\n     We got an idea of what to expect at Anfield \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     They went 1-0 up but lost 2-1 despite having enough chances to win the game, with their worst miss coming when Raheem Sterling skied his shot when he was clean through.\n     Liverpool played a 4-3-3 formation that day. But they did not have Daniel Sturridge or Gerrard, who were both injured. City, who were without Sergio Aguero, lined up in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Alvaro Negredo as their lone striker.\n     Luis Suarez played as Liverpool's central striker, with Coutinho on the left and Sterling on the right. Lucas Leiva played in the holding midfield role, staying very deep just like Gerrard does.\n     This time, I think Rodgers will go 4-3-3 again, but with Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling across the front three, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     That means Coutinho will be in the team but playing much deeper than he did on Boxing Day.\n     Again, just as in that Spurs game, where Sterling and Glen Johnson went at Tottenham left-back Danny Rose, I think Liverpool will target the left side of City's defence.\n     Whether it is Gael Clichy or Aleksandar Kolarov at left-back, and Martin Demichelis or Joleon Lescott as City's left-sided centre-back, that side is far weaker than Kompany and Pablo Zabaleta on the right.\n     Because of the pace of the Liverpool attack, I think City should go with their faster defenders to deal with it - Clichy and Lescott rather than Kolarov and Demichelis.\n     It is a big call for Pellegrini, but he has stuck with Demichelis until now, and probably will again. Whoever he goes for alongside Kompany, it is a gamble.\n     City are used to starting games on the front foot but their defence will have to be ready for a fast start by Liverpool on Sunday. \n     Time and time again this season, particularly at Anfield, Liverpool have over-run lots of teams early on in games. \n     They have scored in the first half in 31 of their 33 league games so far, and have hit a total of 54 first-half goals, by far the most of any top-flight team.\n 1. Liverpool - 54 1. Chelsea - 9 2. Man City - 37 2. Man City - 10 3. Chelsea - 28 3. Everton - 12 Liverpool have played two more games than City 1. Liverpool - 31 1. = Chelsea/Everton - 24 2. Man City - 22 3. Arsenal - 22 3. Chelsea - 18 4. = Man City/C Palace/Hull - 21     City are also a high-scoring, attacking team. Both they and Liverpool have a chance of beating Chelsea's record from 2009-10 of 103 goals in a Premier League campaign.\n Liverpool have played two more games than City Liverpool 455 (1) 227 (1) 19.78% (2) 90 (1) Man City 420 (3) 195 (3) 20% (1) 84 (2)     Their strength is going forward, but City have improved defensively in recent months, and have conceded only four goals in their last nine Premier League games, compared to 25 in their previous 22 league matches. \n     There are plenty of reasons they will be confident of surviving any early onslaught at Anfield. Pellegrini's side have conceded the first goal only five times in their 31 Premier League games, and only four first-half goals in 16 league games away from home. Only Chelsea have conceded fewer first-half goals in total.\n     Part of that comes down to the way City impose themselves on games rather than their ability to hold out under pressure, but they can defend when they have to.\n Liverpool have played two more games than City Liverpool 424 (11th best) 130 (6th best) 40 (7th best) 10 (=10th best) Man City 307 (1st best) 106 (2nd best) 29 (2nd best) 13 (=2nd best)     They will have to be solid at Anfield. The strength of Liverpool's attack means this will be City's biggest defensive test in the league this season. Any lapses will be punished.\n     Even without any individual errors, the Reds front three is good enough to find a way through City's back four, so the protection offered by Fernandinho and Toure in front of them will be crucial. They cannot leave their defence exposed at any time.\n     I would expect an open game, where both teams have spells where they are on top and both teams create lots of chances. Just like at Etihad Stadium, who wins will come down to which team can take theirs.\n      \n ",

        "article": "    In Britain, Argentine Diego Simeone is best remembered as the man whose reaction to a petulant kick by David Beckham resulted in the England star famously being sent off during a World Cup game in 1998.\n     That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). \n Simeone was on the receiving end of Beckham's infamous kick in 1998\r\n       And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days.\n     If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\"\n     Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff.\n     Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real.\n     To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. \n     Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles.\n     The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes.\n     Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football.\n     For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. \n     In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer.\n     That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks.\n     That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. \n Atletico are unbeaten against Barcelona in five matches this season and meet on the final day of the La Liga campaign\r\n       Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack.\n     As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. \n     Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable.\n     More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head.\n     For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up.\n     That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster.\n Simeone credited the Atletico fans with inspiring his team to victory in the Champions League\r\n       Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort.\n     When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour.\n Head to head and not goal difference decides teams level on points. Atletico have better record than Real, and yet to play Barcelona twice 79 78 76     As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. \n     But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility.\n     Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\"\n     Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be. \n ",

        "article": "    Augusta. The Masters. Three words to make golf fans drool every April. \n     This hallowed corner of an unremarkable Georgia town is one of sport's most famous settings, the tournament one of the world's most unique events. Here are 18 reasons why we love the Masters.\n     Ah, Augusta. Just the name evokes an iconic image in green, punctuated by explosions of colour from banks of azaleas and framed by towering pines, with grass so sumptuous you could make a suit out of it. \n     Driving up the adjacent Washington Road strip, with its bars, burger joints, motels, parking lots and neon plantations, you would struggle to believe such treasure could lie over the fence. \"It's like being in the most perfect picture that has ever been painted,\" said England's Ian Poulter.\n     Think genteel country club rather than brash sports venue. The smart but humble 19th century plantation-style clubhouse at the end of Magnolia Lane sets the tone for this spring rite. The visual splendour, the traditions and history, the reverence of the spectators and Augusta's limited-numbers policy add to the occasion. \"It's a very interesting place and has a wonderful feel. I still love it after 40-odd years,\" says veteran BBC golf broadcaster Peter Alliss.\n     It's Augusta's way or the highway, but the rules - strictly enforced with Southern charm - add to the ambience. Broadcasters and the media are also expected to toe the line. Fans are to be known as \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and controversy is to be avoided. The no-running rule does at least provide the morning spectacle of speed-walkers scuttling off to all parts to place chairs. Phones are also a no-no, as is sleeping on the course. \"I always marvel at how they control all those people with a bit of string. Possibly some trepidation at putting a foot wrong,\" notes Alliss.\n     Stay on the right side of the law and the Masters will treat you well. Sandwiches, including the traditional Pimento Cheese, cost between $1.50 and $3 and domestic beer, in Masters-logoed plastic cups you can take home, is $3. Fancy foreign stuff is $4. Despite an image rooted in tradition, the Augusta National is always looking to refine and innovate, such as the state-of-the-art digital coverage. Southern splendour with a modern agenda.\n     As the only major at the same venue every year, each triumph and disaster adds another layer to the legend. The National was opened in 1933 on the site of an old plant nursery, and the first Masters - then called the \"Invitational\" - was staged the following year. Traditions abound, such as the Champions Dinner, ceremonial starters, the par-three contest or amateurs bunking down in the Crow's Nest above the clubhouse.  Landmarks also become old friends.

The jacket was first introduced for members in 1937 and ordered from Brooks Uniform Company in New York. \n     Sam Snead was the first winner to receive a jacket and honorary membership in 1949. The reigning Masters champion can take it home for a year, then it must be kept at the club. The jacket comes with a two-page list of rules, according to last year's winner Adam Scott.\n     A Masters badge feels like Willy Wonka's golden ticket to most but the lucky few (well, roughly 30,000 a day on practice days, half that during the tournament) get one of the best views in sport. Augusta's seat-saving etiquette is unique. Plonk your green fold-up chair anywhere outside the ropes and return hours later to reclaim your spot. It will be empty and waiting. \n Patrons arrange chairs around Amen Corner during the second round of the 2013 Masters\r\n       The Tuesday evening shindig for past champions is one of sport's most exclusive clubs. The elite few dine off a menu dreamed up by last year's winner. \n     Tradition dictates they opt for dishes from their homeland, throwing up some mouthwatering delicacies over the years such as Sandy Lyle's \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and Charl Schwartzel's monkey gland sauce. \n     Arnie, Jack and co. can order off the clubhouse menu if they're not game for a bush tucker trial.

In its 53-year existence, no par-three champion has ever won the Masters in the same year.\n      \n     White Dogwood, 505 yards, par 4.  \n      \n     Golden Bell, 155 yards, par 3.\n      \n     Azalea, 510 yards, par 5. \n     Golf's most iconic stretch of holes, visually stunning and technically demanding, Amen Corner can be a round-wrecker or a springboard for a back-nine charge. \n     The term \"Amen Corner\" was coined by sportswriter Herbert Warren Wind in 1958 for the area down at the lowest part of the course: the 11th, 12th and tee shot on 13. \n     The par-four 11th is the second most difficult hole on the course, after the 10th, followed by the short 12th across Rae's Creek where the wind swirls and makes club selection so difficult. Tom Weiskopf holds the record with a 13 there, in 1980. \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     says three-time champion Gary Player. \"Amen Corner - what an appropriate name.\"\n     If leaves and branches could talk, these boughs would have thousands of stories to tell. The old oak - or actually two oaks, one smaller one next to the main tree - on the course side of the clubhouse is the hub of Masters week. \n     All golf's movers, shakers and hangers-on will be found lurking in its shade, interviewing players, doing business deals, gossiping, being seen. \n     Everyone's guilty of \"fomo\" (fear of missing out) as eyes dart and heads swivel, trying to spot someone more important to talk to. 'Meet you under the tree' is a traditional Masters refrain for those with the right badge.\n Caddies with Mike Weir, Garrick Porteous and Jason Day on Hogan's Bridge on the 12th hole in practice \r\n       That ice-white boiler suit is quintessential Augusta. Before 1983, staff caddies were assigned to Masters players. All were black, and many went by nicknames such as Fireball, Ironman and Cemetery. After 1983, players were allowed to bring their own caddies but they still had to wear the traditional white jump suit. \n     Two-time champion Ben Crenshaw's long-time Masters caddie Carl Jackson is one of the remaining old school Augusta bagmen, who began working at the course aged 14 in 1961. He will work a record 53rd Masters this year. \"That suit is pretty thick so you can get really hot. At least you can pack light - a couple of pairs of shorts and some T-shirts to wear under it,\" said Martin Kaymer's caddie Craig Connelly.\n     An icon in white, the modest manor belies is status as the home of the Green Jackets. Built in 1854 by the owner of the then indigo plantation, it stands sentinel at the highest point of the course. \n     The front door, at the end of Magnolia Lane, opens onto a short hallway with a reception desk and offices. Twenty odd paces take you through a lounge, housing the Masters trophy, to the back door and the course. A spiral staircase leads to the library, an informal dining room with additional seating on the veranda. The Champions Locker room - officially the Masters Club Room - is to the rear. \"The clubhouse has grown over the years but it is still attractive and comfortable, not glitzy at all,\" said Alliss.\n     Another tradition adding to Masters lore, wide-eyed amateurs are invited to stay, for a modest (and undisclosed) sum, in the eaves of the clubhouse during Masters week. The five-room dormitory is reached from the library via an unmarked door which leads into a small hallway. \n     On one side there is another door to the Champions Locker Room. Plenty of young men have stumbled, accidentally or otherwise, into the exclusive domain of Masters winners. Opposite, behind another non-descript door, is the steep staircase to the Crow's Nest and its unmistakeable glass cupola.\n     Among former residents to have won the Masters are Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods. Tales of 'Nesters' abound - one has Nicklaus getting reprimanded for abusing the club's hospitality by having two steaks a night as a 19-year-old in 1959.\n     The most exclusive place in this most exclusive of clubs, the domain of the few is another Masters mystique. Behind a door marked \"Masters Club Room - private\", past champions get to change, eat, gossip and gripe in seclusion. Twenty-eight oak lockers with brass nameplates line the room, with two players to a locker. Adam Scott shares with Gary Player. \"Gary gets a lot of mail so there's not much room for my stuff,\" says new incumbent Scott. \n     If the visual splendour and waft of pine and cut grass isn't enough of an assault on the senses, the Masters keeps your ears busy too. The roars greeting great shots reverberate around the pines, which act like the reeds in a giant mouth organ, especially on the lower parts of the back nine where the noise is coralled.\n Phil Mickelson is a three-time Masters winner and hugely popular with the Augusta crowds\r\n       A Sunday roar has a deeper, more urgent resonance than a Thursday roar. And a Woods or Mickelson roar tops the lot. \"To feel that energy and to hear the roars and be a part of what's happening that final nine holes, it's the greatest experience for a professional golfer,\" says 'Lefty'. \n     The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     reads like a who's who of golf and reinforces its status. Jack Nicklaus tops the pile with six wins followed by Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods on four. Phil Mickelson, Nick Faldo, Gary Player, Sam Snead and Jimmy Demaret are on three each. This week marks the 25th anniversary of Faldo's first win. His third victory in 1996 is still the last by a player from Britain and Ireland. Europe's last winner was 15 years ago, when Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal won his second Green Jacket.\n     There is more to winning a Green Jacket than just piecing the parts together. Sure, you need a bit of length off the tee, have pin-point precision with your irons, chip and putt like a God and keep a lid on the nerves, but a sprinkle of magic helps, too. \n  Media requires JavaScript to play. 2005 Masters: Tiger Woods chips in on 16     Witness \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     or Mickelson's six iron through the trees on 13 in 2010, or Bubba Watson's wedge from the woods on 10 in 2012. \n     \"When your eyeballs are flashing because your heart is hitting you so hard in the chest from inside out and you've got to deal with degrees and inches, it's a hard game. But somebody is going to pull it off and when they do, they're revered for it,\" said Azinger.\n ",

Highlights on BBC Two from 17:30 BST     Mo Farah's attempt to win the London Marathon on his debut and David Weir's bid for his seventh title are among the highlights of the 2014 race on Sunday.\n     Double Olympic gold-medal winner Farah, 31, faces a strong field and \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Weir is aiming to overtake Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson's haul of six wins in the wheelchair race, a record \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     The 30,000-strong race will also feature thousands of amateur runners.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. London launches 'Digital Marathon'     Farah will face the biggest test of his career, knowing his\n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and three World Championship crowns on the track will count for nothing. \n     Lining up against the home favourite will be world-record holder Wilson Kipsang, reigning champion Tsegaye Kebede, course record holder Emmanuel Mutai and Olympic and world champion Stephen Kiprotich.\n     Geoffrey Mutai, who has \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     - albeit on a Boston course ineligible for record purposes - will be there, too. He is one of seven athletes in the field who have run under two hours five minutes. \n     The race will feature four of the fastest 10 marathon runners in history.

London Marathon run for the first time in 1981     One thing is guaranteed: his preparations, under the guidance of coach Alberto Salazar, will have been meticulous.\n     Salazar said: \"There have been a lot of people that are great at shorter events and aren't as good in the marathon. And what's the reason for that?\n     \"One, physically there's something there; their energy systems are more suited for shorter races. Number two is the psychological part.\n     \"The psychological part, forget. Mo is just so tough there's no way the psychological part is going to be a problem.

Kelly wins surprise 100m butterfly title     The British Championships, which present the final opportunity for swimmers to secure their place at the Commonwealths, are taking place at Tollcross, Glasgow - the venue for swimming this summer.\n     Pavoni finished seventh at the Delhi Games in 2010 after becoming one of several swimmers to succumb to illness in India.\n     However, after clocking the new English record and second quickest time for a Commonwealth swimmer this year, he is confident he can challenge for the podium this summer.\n     \"I haven't done a personal best in that event since 2012, so it's a massive confidence boost,\" Pavoni told BBC Sport.\n     \"I like this pool and hopefully even though I'm English, the crowd can give me a good cheer when I race this summer.\"\n     Guy, 18, set a new British record over 400m on Thursday and admitted returning for another intense race 24 hours later may have been behind his failure to secure an automatic place on the England team.\n \r\n\t\t I came into the competition thinking I would come second to Fran [Halsall] so it feels absolutely amazing \r\n\t     \"I would have liked to have swum quicker tonight, but I was a little tired and after all that racing I'm relatively pleased because I think it will be enough [for a Commonwealth berth],\" said, Guy who was just over a second off the required time.\n     Kelly, 20, produced the surprise of the night by seeing off the challenge of established international swimmers O'Connor and Halsall to win the 100m butterfly in 58.40 seconds.\n     \"I came into the competition thinking I would come second to Fran [Halsall] so it feels absolutely amazing,\" said Kelly, who edged out O'Connor by 0.02 secs.\n     Two-time world champion Liam Tancock faces an anxious wait to learn if he will be allowed to defend his 100m backstroke Commonwealth crown after finishing second to Chris Walker-Hebborn.\n     Tancock's time of 54.51 was outside the English Commonwealth mark, as was Walker-Hebborn's effort of 53.82, but that should be enough to secure him at least a place in the medley relay line-up.\n     Ben Proud secured gold over 50m butterfly for the second year in a row, whilst Sophie Taylor won her maiden British title in the 50m breaststroke event.\n     However, both English swimmers will need to perform over their respective 100m distances later in the competition to be guaranteed places in the English team.\n     In the evening's only multi-classification event, Paralympian Stephanie Slater claimed gold in the 100m freestyle, securing her place in the England team in one of only a handful of disability races included in the Glasgow programme.\n     England's Adam Peaty qualified quickest for Saturday's 100m breaststroke final in an impressive 59.83, with Scottish duo Ross Murdoch and Michael Jamieson close behind.\n ",

Paul Lambert plays down relegation fears     Grant Holt went close for Villa, before Yannick Bolasie's penalty appeal was turned down when he went down under pressure from Holt, but no contact had been made.\n     Palace were engineering the best chances, with Bolasie and Jerome again at the centre of the action after the break. \n     Bolasie forced an acrobatic save from Brad Guzan and Jerome, two yards from goal, directed the rebound onto the crossbar. \n     Palace continued to threaten. Bolasie went close from close range, a Puncheon free-kick forced Guzan into action, and referee Webb initially awarded a penalty to the hosts before changing his mind after consulting with an assistant referee. \n  Media requires JavaScript to play. I'm just doing my job - Pulis     Again, Bolasie was the source of Villa's troubles but replays proved Nathan Baker had not handled the forward's cross. \n     Ultimately, it mattered little as moments later Bolasie found Puncheon and the former Southampton man outmuscled Ryan Bertrand to score and become Palace's leading scorer in the league. \n     Villa's best moments came after they fell behind, with Holt wasting a great chance and Speroni stopping a fine Andreas Weimann effort. \n      \n     \"We are a million miles from where we want to be. \n     \"Anyone who knows me will tell you my ambition. If you can't win a game of football it is what happens. We have to win a game of football.\n     \"You're in that group and the only simple solution is to win the next game, that gives you the breathing space.\"\n      \n    \r\n  \r\n\n           Match ends, Crystal Palace 1, Aston Villa 0.

        "article": "    Super League leaders St Helens scored three tries in the last 12 minutes to snatch victory over Castleford.\n     Second-placed Cas looked well on course for the nine-point win they needed to take over at the top when they led 24-6 at the break, centre Michael Shenton scoring twice against his former club.\n     But, on the night he broke the Super League appearance record, Paul Wellens scored after a Tommy Makinson special.\n     And winger Adam Swift completed the comeback three minutes from time.\n     Sia Soliola, Jonny Lomax and Jordan Turner scored Saints' other three tries on a night when the ageless Wellens sparked the remarkable fightback which enabled the leaders to maintain their 100% record.  \n     Playing his 414th Super League game, the 34-year-old Saints legend overtook the record previously held by one of his former England and Great Britain team-mates, Leeds centre Keith Senior.\n     His appearance at the start of the second half proved the catalyst - and, when he ran in the fourth of Saints' five second-half tries, he brought up the 1,000th point of his career.\n     Saints could hardly have made a worse start, the returning Jon Wilkin knocking-on from the kick-off, to allow Cas to score their first try inside their first set of tackles.\n     Centre Jake Webster set the scoreboard rolling by taking Daryl Clark's short pass to go through the visitors' defence, Marc Sneyd kicking the first of his four goals.\n     Winger Justin Carney was denied by the video referee for a knock-on by Shenton before turning provider on 11 minutes when he collected Liam Finn's high kick to send his skipper over for the first of his two touchdowns.\n     A grubber kick from Sneyd then bounced awkwardly for Saints, creating a try for loose forward Grant Millington, Sneyd's third conversion making it 18-0. And it could have been more, but prop Craig Huby spilled the ball going over.\n     Two goal-line drop-outs and a big contribution from replacement Alex Walmsley gave St Helens the momentum to pull a try back on 27 minutes when second-rower Soliola took Wilkin's pass to power his way over.\n     Luke Walsh's goal made it 18-6 but the Tigers struck again nine minutes before half-time when Shenton scooped up a wayward pass from Turner to sprint 40 metres for his second try.\n     Cas left the field at half-time to a standing ovation but Wellens, unused throughout the first 40 minutes, led his team out for the start of the second half, and that turned the game.\n     The Tigers had a third try disallowed when full-back Luke Dorn was ruled to have benefitted from obstruction, and Saints struck with two tries in seven minutes.\n \r\n\t\t The boys have got a lot of respect for him and, as far as captains go, and I don't think there's any better around \r\n\t     Full-back Lomax took a return pass from centre Josh Jones to touch down wide out before right-winger Makinson, Super League's top try scorer, produced one of his now trademark flying finishes to touch down one-handed in the other corner - his ninth of the season.\n     Walsh had the misfortune to strike the woodwork attempting to convert both second-half tries to leave his side trailing by 10 points, and Castleford looked to have made sure of victory on 59 minutes when Carney won the race to Sneyd's kick to the corner.\n     However, Turner collected Wilkin's kick on 68 minutes to start the fightback, Wellens then finished off a thrilling cross-field move and Swift gathered Wilkin's pass to cross for the winner.\n      \n     \"It's disappointing. It was new Cas in the first half, then old Cas in the second half. I thought the second half was very poor from us.\n     \"We allowed a team that can play a fair bit of rugby league back into the game.\n     \"There are some hard lessons to be learned. I thought we should have won the game. I'm not sure the video ref got all the decisions right, but I'm not going to blame anybody but us.\"\n      \n     \"He's an amazing player and an amazing captain for us. It's no coincidence that when 'Wello' went on the field the commitment from each player was better.\n     \"The boys have got a lot of respect for him and, as far as captains go, and I don't think there's any better around.\"\n      \n     Dorn; Clare, Shenton, Webster, Carney; Sneyd, Finn; Lynch, Clark, Huby, Hauraki, Holmes, Millington.\n      \n     Milner, Massey, Boyle, Mariano.\n      \n    Lomax; Makinson, Turner, Dawson, Swift; Wilkin, Walsh; Masoe, Roby, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Soliola, Manu, Jones.\n      \n     Laffranchi, Wellens, Walmsley, Greenwood.\n      \n     6,487\n      \n    Ben Thaler\n ",
