[{"article": "Chancellor George Osborne has hailed the UK's economic recovery in a keynote speech in Washington DC. Mr Osborne said critics of the government's economic plan have been proved \"comprehensively wrong\". His speech comes a year after the International Monetary Fund said Mr Osborne's austerity policies were \"playing with fire\". Labour said Mr Osborne was \"out of touch\" with the millions of people in the UK facing a cost-of-living crisis. Speaking while in the US capital for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, the chancellor said that cutting deficits and controlling spending had \"laid the foundations for sustainable growth\". Mr Osborne admitted \"many risks remain\" but said there was cause for \"cautious optimism\". \"It's only by continuing to work through our long-term economic plan that we can deliver more economic security and a brighter future for all,\" he said. His visit comes after the latest IMF forecasts predicted the UK would be the fastest-growing major economy this year. Mr Osborne used his keynote speech to reject the arguments of the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who warned last year that the UK's austerity policies were strangling growth. And the chancellor also dismissed suggestions that the West is locked in a cycle of economic stagnation, declaring: \"Our nations' best days lie ahead.\" He said that the strengthening economy in Britain is underpinned by well-capitalised banks and a \"credible\" fiscal policy. \"Our economy has grown faster than any other in the G7 over the last year and is now forecast by the IMF to do the same in 2014,\" Mr Osborne said in his address to the American Enterprise Institute think tank. \"This is despite warnings from some that our determined pursuit of our economic plan made that impossible. \"All of this demonstrates that fiscal consolidation and economic recovery go together, and undermines the pessimistic prognosis that only further fiscal stimulus can drive sustainable growth.  \"Indeed, that is precisely the wrong prescription for our economies. \"Instead of more debt or more government spending, we need to get our public finances in order, make structural reforms and compete in the world again.\" But Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The last thing millions of people facing a cost-of-living crisis want to hear is an out-of-touch chancellor trying to tell them everything is going well. \"In 2010 George Osborne promised sustained rises in living standards, a secured rather than choked-off recovery and the books balanced by 2015. On every single pledge he has badly failed.\" Mr Leslie said Labour's plans would \"boost living standards for all\" and \"secure a strong and balanced recovery\".

Output fell by 2.8% - \u00a3270m - compared with a month earlier, the   said.  But in the three months to the end of February, construction output grew 0.3% compared with the previous quarter.  Despite signs of improvement, the construction industry remains 13.2% below its pre recession peak. The ONS said the heavy rain and flooding that marked the wettest winter on record had caused delays in building work.  It added that repairs of flood damage had not yet filtered through to its data. The fall in February's construction output was the biggest monthly decline since November 2013 and dragged the annual growth figure lower.  The ONS said construction output increased 2.8% in the year to February, compared with a 5.7% increase in January. Output measures the amount charged by construction companies to customers for the work they do.  Within the figures, private sector new housing activity, which had driven growth in the construction sector in 2013, fell by 6.3% in February - the biggest fall for nearly a year. The construction industry contributes 6.3% to overall UK economic growth. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at HIS Global Insight said despite February's sharp fall, it was still likely that construction output would still see clear overall expansion in the first quarter of 2014, He pointed out that construction output in January and December had risen strongly and added that a rebound in construction activity in March of just 1% would result in quarterly growth of 0.5%. \"In fact, any growth in construction output in March would result in some overall expansion in the first quarter, as even flat output in March itself would see output up 0.1% in the first quarter,\" he said. \"It needs to be remembered that the implications for overall GDP growth in the first quarter are relatively limited.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26987375", "title": ["UK construction output shrinks 2.8% in February "]},
{"article": "The Co-operative Bank has confirmed it made a loss of \u00a31.3bn for 2013. The losses, in line with expectations, come after the bank's failed bid to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Bank last year. The deal collapsed after the discovery of a \u00a31.5bn black hole in the Co-op Bank's balance sheet.  Parent company the Co-operative Group lost control of the bank to a group of US hedge funds that launched a rescue deal in December. The bank said it did not expect to make a profit in 2014 or 2015. It also apologised to its 4.7 million customers.    Media requires JavaScript to play. Co-op Bank chief executive Niall Booker said: \"We appreciate that customers and other stakeholders continue to feel angry about how past failings placed the future of the business so seriously at risk.  \"I would like to apologise to them, to thank them for their continued loyalty and to thank colleagues for their commitment during such difficult times.\" The bank said it would not pay out \u00a35m to former executives who left the bank after its near collapse last year. But Mr Booker will receive a \u00a32.9m pay package, which includes a basic salary of \u00a31.2m and up to \u00a31.7m in performance related bonuses.  Mr Booker could also receive a potential \u00a31.2m as part of a three year incentive plan based on the future performance of the business.  It said up to 40 of its high street branches will close this year, which is likely have an impact on jobs, although the bank has yet to put a figure on the number of posts under threat. The results were published after two earlier delays.  Beneath the news of the losses that were widely expected, those interested in the future of the Co-op Bank will focus on two things.  How is the bank progressing on its plans to raise a further \u00a3400m and is there any evidence of a decline in customer numbers? On the first, I am told negotiations are going well.  As yet, the Co-op Group - which owns 30% of the bank - has not agreed to inject more money and there will be a lot of interest in what it says about the issue when it publishes its own annual results next week. On the second there is mixed evidence.  The number of current account holders is up slightly while business customers - far more affected by the ratings downgrades suffered by the Co-op - has declined.  In March, Co-op Bank was forced to admit it had found another \u00a3400m black hole in its finances, forcing it to issue new shares in an attempt to raise the funds from investors.  The shortfall became apparent after the discovery of additional costs related to past misconduct and poor documentation. The biggest part of the additional costs relate to payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling and lapses in the provision of mortgages. The bank said it would pay \u00a3114m to compensate customers who had been overcharged on mortgage repayments,  It has also set aside \u00a3110m to cover breaches of the Consumer Credit Act and \u00a3103m to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI).  Small businesses that were mis-sold complex interest rate hedging products will collectively receive \u00a333m in compensation. The Co-op Bank's additional rights issue has also triggered speculation that the Co-op Group's remaining 30% stake could be diluted, because it would struggle to find additional funds to maintain its shareholding. In December, the bank was the subject of a dramatic \u00a31.5bn rescue deal in which its parent company, the Co-operative Group, lost control of the bank to a group of US hedge funds,  They took a 70% stake in the bank.  Chris Wheeler, a banking analyst at Mediobanca, told BBC the bank was in a \"parlous position\". He said: \"It needs \u00a3400m more capital, [it is] claiming it's going to be a rights issue, The Co-op Group has to put in \u00a3120m.    \"So, big capital gap to be filled, and if the Co-op is no longer a major shareholder, one asks the question as to really what is the future style of the bank, because it may no longer be part of the Co-op Group per se.\" He also questioned whether members of the Co-op Group would want to put more money into the bank, suggesting the group might chose to protect its other businesses, which include the supermarket chain Somerfield and the Co-operative funeral home business.  Lord McFall, a Labour Co-operative peer, told the BBC he thought the Co-op Group should still invest in the beleaguered bank.  \"If you break it you own it,\" he said, blaming bad management and a lack of leadership at the top of the group for the bank's misfortunes. \"Not only did they sell the crown jewels, but they vandalised them,\" he added. Mr Booker said he was confident the bank would raise the additional \u00a3400m it needed even if the Co-op Group chose not to put in any further cash. \"Shareholders are very, very supportive and I really, really think that we're going to get this through the gate,\" he added. The Co-op Group itself has been forced to delay the publication of its annual results, after the departure last month of its chief executive, Euan Sutherland. The group's losses are expected to be about \u00a32bn. Mr Sutherland left after it was revealed that in a Facebook post he had described the group as \"ungovernable\". Earlier in March, details of his basic salary of \u00a31.5m, including a retention bonus of another \u00a31.5m, were leaked to the press. On Wednesday, it emerged that former Labour City minister Lord Myners, who had been drafted in by the Co-op Group in December to lead a review of the business, had resigned his position on the board of directors. Lord Myners was appointed as an independent director by Co-op Group chair Ursula Lidbetter in December to undertake a full review of the entire business.  His initial findings showed the group's elected directors had overseen \"breathtakingly value-destructive\" decisions, among which were the Co-op's takeovers of Britannia building society and supermarket chain Somerfield. He also found its three-tier system of elected member representation - made up of area committees, regional boards and the group board - had \"consistently produced governors without the necessary qualifications and experience to provide effective board leadership\". Too many directors, he said, did not have any serious business experience and were therefore not qualified to keep senior managers in check. Instead, he recommended new group board directors should be appointed according to clear criteria of skills and experience. But some of the Co-op's most influential members are worried that the changes could damage the group's values.

{"article": "Europe must be firm over sanctions against Russia, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said. Even if future sanctions result in economic weakness in Europe, Russia's annexation of Ukraine \"will not be tolerated,\" the influential politician told the BBC. However, Europe wanted close partnerships with Russia, he said. Mr Schaeuble's comments came ahead of a meeting of the IMF and G20 finance ministers on Friday. The issue of Russia in the Ukraine must be solved, Mr Schaeuble said. \"We in Europe know that we can't solve such a problem with military force, therefore it has to be solved with diplomatic and economic instruments,\" he said.  \"We can't accept that someone is changing international rules and borders. That must not be tolerated, and that will not be tolerated.  We have to defend the freedom of movement for all people who want to work in Europe, because it's a huge achievement\u201d \"Therefore, [even] if that would cause some economic weakness, we will stick to this position.\" Mr Schaeuble said that it was in the interests of Europe and Russia to have close partnerships, but that Russia was taking the most risk in continuing on its course. In a in a wide-ranging BBC interview, Mr Schaeuble also addressed the issue of European immigration. Immigrants within the European Union should not be able to claim benefits from their host country, he said. Instead, EU immigrants should get benefits from their home country if needed, he said. Freedom of movement for people to work within the EU is vital for the prosperity of the European Union, he added. \"We have to defend the freedom of movement for all people who want to work in Europe, because it's a huge achievement,\" he said.  \"But, we must find a solution so that people can only have freedom of movement, but not choose wherever they want to get social assistance. \"You can do it if we make European law in a way that it's clear that you have the freedom to work, but you can't ask for social assistance in the member state you want to choose.  \"If you need social assistance, then the responsibility is on your home state,\" he said. Anna Platonova, a regional labour migration specialist at the International Organisation for Migration, said that European social security systems would need to be coordinated before this idea could be put into practice.  \"Improving coordination of social security rights among states in the EU is much needed and would benefit from more in-depth evidence and collaboration between EU countries,\" she said. \"Despite their skills and efforts to find work, EU citizens face many obstacles in securing a job before arrival, but also while job-seeking in the country of destination.  \"This is where access to social security can make a difference to a migrant's dignity, productivity and even the ability to return to her or his country,\" she added. There has been debate throughout the EU on the effects of immigration between member states for a number of years. On 1 January this year, Bulgarians and Romanians gained the same rights as other EU citizens to work in member state countries, sparking a fresh round of debate. The German government has been concerned about welfare-abuse, and is in the process of revising its benefits for EU migrants. Mr Schaeuble said that it is possible for a Bulgarian to earn more from benefits in Germany than from working in Bulgaria. \"It makes no sense,\" he said. Recently, the UK government has put in place a series of measures designed to restrict access to benefits for migrants from other EU countries, including a minimum earnings threshold of \u00a3149 per week to claim benefits. The eurozone's fragile economic recovery is not yet complete, Mr Schaeuble said.  \"The crisis is not over, but we are on the right way, we have [had] impressive success,\" he said. \"The average deficit of all member states has halved in the last couple of years. \"The eurozone as a whole has left the time of recession and has moved to growth. Greece is moving to growth this year. \"The most risk is always complacency. As soon as we have some success we are tempted to be a little bit more flexible, and that is dangerous. We have to stick on the right course.\" The European Central Bank has been holding interest rates down as part of measures to encourage the eurozone economy, but inflation has gradually fallen, raising the possibility of deflation. ECB president Mario Draghi has said economic stimulus through quantitative easing will be deployed if necessary. Mr Schaeuble said that the eurozone is not facing a situation where deflation is likely. \"I think that growth is too low in the eurozone still, but I think the forecast for the coming year is fine.  \"Nobody sees a real danger of deflation... It's the expectation that investors and consumers wait on lower prices, and there is no sign for this.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26985252", "title": ["Russia action in Ukraine 'will not be tolerated', Schaeuble says"]},
{"article": "US banking giant JPMorgan Chase has reported a sharp fall in profits at the start of 2014, which it blamed on declines in its mortgage business. The bank said net income in the three months to the end of March was $5.3bn (\u00a33.1bn) - a fall of 19% compared with a year earlier. Profits from its mortgage business stood at $114m, down $559m from last year.  The figures mark the second successive quarterly fall in profits at the bank.  It comes as Wells Fargo, the biggest US mortgage lender, reported a higher-than-expected 14% rise in first-quarter net profit. But it said the rise in profits was the result of a series of equity investment gains, which helped offset a continuing slowdown in its home loan business. It said net income rose to $5.6bn in the first three months of 2014, from $4.93bn a year earlier. Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo suffered from a fall in remortgaging activity.  Wells Fargo provides almost one in five US home loans. It said income from mortgage banking fell by 46% to $1.5bn from $2.7bn a year earlier. Applications for refinancing fell to their lowest share of total mortgage applications since July 2009 in the week ending 4 April, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said. And Black Knight Financial Services said February was the worst month for new home loans since at least 2000.  Wells Fargo's new home loans fell to $36bn in the quarter from $109bn a year earlier and from $50bn in the fourth quarter.  The company had not made so few home loans since the third quarter of 2008, when the housing market was under heavy stress. At the same time, profits from JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking division stood at $2bn, down from $2.6bn just three months earlier.  For JPMorgan, 2013 was marred by huge legal settlements over its mortgage practices in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. The \"London whale\" trading scandal and other controversies including legal costs relating to the fraudster Bernie Madoff also dented earnings in 2013. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon still described the bank's first quarter results as \"good\" given the industry-wide headwinds in both investment banking and mortgages.  \"We have growing confidence in the economy -- consumers, corporations and middle market companies are in increasingly good financial shape and housing has turned the corner in most markets -- and we are doing our part to support the recovery,\" Mr Dimon said. Mr Dimon called the conditions of 2013 \"painful and nerve-wracking\" in a letter to shareholders in April.  However, bank officials are hopeful 2014 will see fewer large legal settlements with regulators and private parties.

{"article": "US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has urged other countries to contribute more to the economic rescue of Ukraine. He told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that Ukraine's \"sizeable financing needs\" meant other nations must add to its $1bn (\u00a3597m, 720m euros) loan guarantee. The appeal came as Ukraine's interim prime minister offered to devolve more powers to eastern regions. Pro-Russian separatists there are defying the government.  Meanwhile, Washington on Friday announced a third round of sanctions against individuals it has linked to Russia's annexation of Crimea. The US Treasury said it had frozen the US-based assets of one former Ukrainian official, a Crimea-based energy firm and six Crimean leaders, including the chairman of the Crimea electoral commission and the mayor of Sevastopol.  Mr Lew says the US is \"bolstering the IMF program through a complementary aid package, which includes a $1bn loan guarantee and additional technical assistance,\" in a   to the IMF. \"It is critical that the international community - multilateral development banks and bilaterals - take immediate steps to also support the IMF program by providing financing support, given the sizeable financing needs,\" he adds. The IMF announced a rescue package worth as much as $18bn last month in a bid to aid Ukraine's economy, and this has been bolstered to $27bn with contributions from Europe and the US. In exchange, the IMF has demanded from Ukraine strict government spending cuts and tax increases.  Ukraine is being squeezed by   to stop providing Ukraine with subsidised natural gas.

Interim Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk: \"We've made an offer... but it's up to them [the separatists] to decide\" Separately on Friday, Ukraine's interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk offered to devolve more powers to the east of the nation and is holding talks with regional leaders in Donetsk, where activists demanding self-rule had occupied a government building. The separatist protests in Ukraine's eastern cities follow Russia's annexation of Crimea last month - described as the biggest political confrontation in Europe since the end of the Cold War. The IMF is also asking Ukraine to crack down on corruption and end central bank support for the Ukrainian currency. Ukraine's new government has said it needs $35bn to pay its bills over the next two years. Ukraine has not paid off its debt to Russian gas supplier Gazprom despite the passing earlier this week of a deadline for the nation to start reducing its debt. Gazprom says Ukraine owes it $2.2bn. European Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger told Austria's ORF radio he was working on a plan to help Ukraine pay its gas bills to ensure its debts do not rise. On Friday, President Putin moved to assure the EU it would not cut off gas supplies. Brussels said it would stand with the new authorities in Kiev if the Kremlin carries out a threat to turn off the tap to Ukraine. \"I want to say again: We do not intend and do not plan to shut off the gas for Ukraine,\" Mr Putin said in televised comments at a meeting of his advisory Security Council, the Reuters news agency reported.  Russia has turned off the gas tap to Ukraine before, in 2006 and 2009. As the 2009 row escalated, gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine were suspended for two weeks. But Russia may be reluctant to do it again as it is dependent on revenue from EU customers. The EU and US have imposed sanctions on a number of Russian and Ukrainian officials in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea. The US Treasury says its latest round of sanctions target the US-based assets of one former Ukrainian official, a Crimea-based energy firm and six Crimean leaders, including the chairman of the Crimea electoral commission and the mayor of Sevastopol.

George Osborne: \"If you are hiding your money offshore, we are coming to get you\" People who hide their money overseas to avoid paying tax face bigger fines and could be jailed more easily under government plans to fight tax evasion. To prosecute at present, tax officials must prove a person holding income offshore has intended to evade tax. But under a new criminal standard officials would only have to show money was taxable and undeclared. Chancellor George Osborne said the changes would mean there was \"no safe haven\" for those evading tax. But Labour said the government was \"failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion\". A consultation will be held to let the public have their say on the plans.  In recent months, the UK has joined other G20 countries in focusing on moves to share information about tax evasion. Now, Mr Osborne says the government will consult on a new criminal standard, harsher fines and increased jail sentences.   At present, offshore tax evaders can be fined twice the amount they owe, and can face criminal prosecution and a possible prison sentence. The government will look at options to increase these penalties, as well as the possibility of financial rewards for whistleblowers who \"help uncover\" untaxed offshore assets. Mr Osborne, who is in Washington DC for the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, said: \"A very important part of our economic plan is that everyone makes a fair contribution.  \"We've already done a lot to crack down on those who don't pay their taxes, now we're introducing a new criminal offence for people who hide their money offshore. \"And the message is very simple - if you're hiding your money offshore, we are coming to get you and the criminal law is going to come and find you.\"  Media requires JavaScript to play.

At a time when families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and the deficit is still high, this simply isn't good enough\u201d \"That certainly has been the objective that they've followed up to now, with their various... so-called amnesties,\" he said. \"And I think that they are thinking that they may get a greater number of people coming forward if the threat of criminal prosecution is there.\" Mr McCann added: \"The over-arching difficulty that the Revenue have got is that for about 100 years in this country, we've operated a sort of prodigal son policy. \"So if someone who has got hidden assets decides to come clean and march into the local tax office, put their hands up and confess all, then the public policy put forward by the government in this country was not to prosecute them. \"And that policy is still in place.\" Mr Osborne predicted a tax deal struck between the British and Swiss governments in 2011 would recover about \u00a33bn in previously unpaid taxes in 2013.

{"article": "Governments are likely to be warned next week that a \"dash for gas\" will not solve climate change.  The chancellor and prime minister have promoted gas as a clean option for powering the UK. But a draft report for the United Nation's third panel on climate change says gas cannot provide a long-term solution to stabilising climate change.  Gas is only worthwhile if it is used to substitute a dirty coal plant - and then only for a short period, it says.  Instead the world should be trebling or quadrupling the share of renewables for electricity, the authors say. The report will offer ammunition to the Department for Energy and Climate Change, which has fought attempts from the Treasury to switch more of the UK's energy sources to gas with the projected \"shale gas revolution\". The UK hopes to emulate the success of the US, where shale gas has slashed energy prices and stimulated manufacturing. However, the draft report backs the position taken by the Environment Agency chairman, Chris Smith, who has told the prime minister the UK could only expand the role of gas in power generation if power stations were fitted with carbon-capture equipment to suck carbon dioxide from exhaust gases and store them in underground rocks. The UK is currently committed to trialling this technology in a gas power station in Peterhead. But the technology is so far untried at scale. It also adds to the cost of gas burning and reduces the efficiency of power stations. The UN report draws an implicit difference between a nation like the US, which has seen a huge fall in emissions by switching from coal to gas, and a country like the UK, which enjoyed its \"dash for gas\" in the 1980s and has since passed the Climate Change Act, requiring an 80% emissions cut across the UK by 2050. Some Conservatives want the act to be repealed and it is not yet clear whether the party's election manifesto will reflect their views.  Labour and the Liberal Democrats back the act. One senior Conservative told me many of his backbench colleagues were heavily influenced by the Mail on Sunday's campaign to define climate change as a con trick. Elsewhere, the UN's draft report spells bad news for coal-exporting countries.  It warns that their exports are likely to be hit as the world turns its back on the fuel.

There are fears that current tensions between Russia and Ukraine could trigger gas shortages in Europe, as pipelines transiting Ukraine deliver Russian gas to several EU countries.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Could Russia turn off the taps? The BBC's Daniel Sandford reports Russian energy giant Gazprom says Ukraine owes it $2.2bn (\u00a31.2bn; 1.4bn euros) and recently doubled the price it must pay.  Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote to 18 European countries on Thursday warning that Ukraine's delays in paying for Russian gas had created a \"critical situation\". The   says that if Ukraine does not settle its energy bill, Gazprom would switch over to advance payment, and if those payments are not made, it would \"completely or partially cease gas deliveries\". Previous Russian gas disputes with Ukraine have led to gas shortages in several EU countries. The EU says it has extra supplies to deal with any such disruption now. Meanwhile, US President Barack Obama has spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone about the growing crisis in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists remain barricaded inside government buildings in Donetsk and Luhansk. President Obama told Ms Merkel that the US and its allies should prepare for fresh sanctions against Russia if the crisis escalates.  The separatists in the east - a mainly Russian-speaking region with close ties to Russia - are demanding referendums on self-rule.  In Donetsk they have declared a \"people's republic\". Gunmen have been seen among the protesters in Luhansk. Ukraine fears that the separatist actions are a provocation similar to the protests that gripped Crimea days before Russian troops annexed the peninsula last month. Russia denies the claim. President Obama and Chancellor Merkel also discussed issues relating to talks due to take place in Geneva next week between Russia, Ukraine, US and the EU to try to end the impasse - the first four-way talks since the crisis began.

The billionaire had been trying to gather support for the proposed split before the e-commerce giant's annual shareholder meeting in May. But Mr Icahn, who first made the call in January, said it had become clear that several major shareholders would not back the plan. However, he said he still believed in the merits of a PayPal spin-off. \"I continue to believe that eBay would benefit from the separation of PayPal at some point in the near future,\" he said in a statement. As part of the agreement reached on Thursday, Mr Icahn, who owns a 0.8% stake in the firm, has also withdrawn his proposal to add two of his own nominees to eBay's board. But in a concession to the investor, eBay said it would follow his recommendation of adding David Dorman, a founding partner of investment firm Centerview Capital Technology, as an independent director on its board.  In the weeks after eBay revealed Mr Icahn's proposal, the investor wrote several letters to fellow shareholders questioning the abilities of eBay chief executive, John Donahoe, and calling corporate governance at the company among the worst he had ever seen. \"We are very pleased to have reached this agreement with Mr Icahn...enabling our board and management team to focus our full attention on a goal every shareholder agrees on - growing PayPal and eBay, and delivering sustainable shareholder value,\" Mr Donahoe  . He and other board members, including eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, have repeatedly said eBay had been funding PayPal's growth, and that the two were better off together. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5bn (\u00a3905m), and the payments company is now the Silicon Valley firm's fastest-growing business, with 143 million active users at the end of 2013, up 16% from a year earlier.

{"article": "Scotch whisky exports stagnated last year, as sales were hit by slowing demand in China and other emerging markets. Figures from the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) showed overseas sales remained flat at \u00a34.3bn by value. In volume terms, exports increased by 2.5% to the equivalent of 1.23 billion bottles.  Scotch whisky performed strongly in the US, Mexico and India but direct exports to China fell by nearly 30% to \u00a351m.  Sales to Taiwan, South Korea and Japan also fell in value, by between 13% and 15%.  We've heard from individual distillers that the fall-off in the Chinese market has a lot to do with official government disapproval of conspicuous consumption, and a crackdown on the culture of business gifts, as they easily cross the line into corruption. It's a challenge that has hit the premium and luxury goods market in quite a big way.  The best performers included the US, which saw exports of Scotch grow 8% on 2012 to a record \u00a3819m.  The US was by far the largest market for whisky by value.  France remained the largest volume market for Scotch.  SWA said sales there rose by 16% as the market recovered following a tax hike on spirits at the start of 2012. India,  which is now Scotch whisky's fourth biggest market by volume, saw the value of whisky sales climb by 12% to \u00a369m.  SWA said it hoped EU-India Free Trade Agreement negotiations would restart following this year's Indian elections, leading to a reduction of the current 150% import tariff. Exports to Brazil and Mexico grew by about 20% - to \u00a399m in Brazil and \u00a3110m in Mexico. A career in the British diplomatic service means David Frost is schooled in the art of choosing his words carefully. The Scotch Whisky Association's chief executive has concerns about independence but he is careful not to overstate them, insisting the vote is a \"decision for the people of Scotland,\" not for its companies. Nonetheless, Mr Frost is seeking \"reassurances\" about the \"risks\" of a 'yes' vote. In the SWA's sunny boardroom in Edinburgh he told me he was concerned that the Scottish government's white paper on independence \"talks of a network of 70 to 90 overseas embassies,\" compared to \"getting on for 200 posts\" in the existing UK diplomatic service. According to the SWA, Scotch whisky represents about 85% of Scottish food and drink exports and about one quarter of the British total, with the industry's exports worth \u00a3135 a second to the UK balance of trade. \"It is important that an independent Scotland gives the same kind of support to the industry and finds ways of doing it that are comparable to what we have now,\" said Mr Frost. \"We're confident this industry is going to succeed whatever the situation after the 18th of September. So we are concerned about the conditions in which we would be operating. We see some risks. We want reassurances. But are we going  to be successful? Yes, you bet.\" In January, spirits producer Diageo reported slowing sales in China and other emerging markets. The company said new rules over gift-giving and spending by Chinese officials dented sales in the country by 66%.  SWA chief executive David Frost said: \"Scotch whisky exports remain strong and the industry's impressive performance makes a major contribution to the UK's trade performance.  \"The unprecedented investment programmes in Scotch whisky by producers show that in the long term they are confident that demand will continue to grow.   \"However, in the short run, there are some economic headwinds. Formal and informal barriers to trade remain.\"  He added: \"We should remember that the industry's success does not come automatically but is based on hard work, investment and careful stewardship.\"  Mr Frost also made a plea for strong government backing for the industry. He said: \"As a former ambassador, I know that the industry also depends on strong political support from government, for example to influence European Union negotiations on our behalf or to press other countries to allow better access to their markets.  \"Both the UK and Scottish governments have played an important role in this so far.\"  He added: \"Whatever the outcome of the Scottish referendum, as an industry exporting to around 200 markets we will continue to need the backing of an effective diplomatic network with the necessary global reach, commercial expertise, and capacity to influence.\"     Overall, Scotch whisky accounts for about 85% of Scottish food and drink exports and nearly a quarter of the British total.

{"article": "France has brought in rules to protect employees from work email disturbing them outside office hours. Would a law to this effect be feasible elsewhere? You're reclining on the beach admiring the surf when your phone goes beep. You've got mail. From your boss. In many jobs, work email doesn't stop when the employee leaves the office. And now France has decided to act. It has introduced rules to protect people working in the digital and consultancy sectors from work email outside office hours. Media reports took that to be before 9am and after 6pm. The deal signed between employers federations and unions says that employees will have to  .  Michel de La Force, chairman of the General Confederation of Managers, has said that \"digital working time\" would have to be measured. Some emailing outside of office hours would be allowed but only in \"exceptional circumstances\".   France has a 35-hour week, adopted in 1998. But the French are not alone in worrying about how portable devices have exposed employees to longer hours. In December 2011, Volkswagen announced that servers would stop sending emails 30 minutes after the end of employees' shifts, and only  . Their move  .  In the UK there is protection for many types of worker in the form of the Working Time Regulations, but the TUC argues this simply doesn't cover out-of-hours email. And there are exemptions for categories of worker like lawyers and doctors.  Employers can't force adults to work more than 48 hours a week - normally averaged over 17 weeks.  Exceptions apply:  Workers can opt out of the 48-hour week.  If an out-of-hours email ban was brought in, the situation could be similar and not everybody would be protected, says Andrew Lilley, an employment lawyer and managing partner at law firm Travers Smith. \"I imagine many jobs would be exempt, a bit like some of the exemptions in the Working Time Regulations.\"  Disruptive email is mainly a white-collar problem. It goes with the territory for certain jobs, such as lawyer or financier, where staff are managing their own time. But others further down the hierarchy working on fixed hours contracts are perhaps also in need of protection.  Technology has redrawn the working day. Woody Allen's 1972 film Play It Again Sam contains a running gag about a workaholic businessman. Played by Tony Roberts he begins every scene by phoning the office to give the telephone number where he can be reached and for how long, followed by the next contact number. He was the exception - workers used to be able to disappear. Today anyone with a smartphone is usually reachable.  An advertising professional who moved from London to New York describes a different email culture. \"I remember on my second day seeing an email from a work colleague sent very late that evening. To my surprise someone replied to it, and then the interaction continued online. And lo and behold we 'were working'. By contrast, in the UK, if I worked late I would often draft emails but save them in my inbox and send them first thing the next morning. That now seems ridiculous and archaic to me. Emails are constant here. It's not that they expect you to answer out of office hours. More that everyone is 'switched on' all the time - that's the culture and pace of New York. I never really heard the concept of work/life balance when I got to the US. There wasn't much complaining as people's expectations were different. It's not just in the corporate world. When my family were moving here and trying to get an apartment I remember being surprised and delighted that our realtor was calling and emailing us late on a Saturday night.\"  Michael Reid, an IT teacher at a Liverpool comprehensive, says his evenings are regularly interrupted. \"An email arrives at 11.45pm and you know a colleague is working late and you want to support them.\" When he sees it in his inbox he is \"crestfallen\", he says. \"It takes the joy out of what you are doing.\"  An advertising consultant in London, who wants to remain anonymous, says she is expected to respond to emails. Many come through between 18:00 and 22:00. \"Needless to say not all emails require an immediate response though if I'm to tell which do and don't, I do need to check them.\" Requests for information she accepts as part of the job. Others - \"can I remind you of X\" or invitations to meetings with no context - drive her \"nuts\", she says. She now switches her phone off when she goes to bed to ensure an uninterrupted night's sleep. Enforcing an email ban would be almost impossible, argues Alief Rezza, an oil analyst in Stavanger, Norway. He checks email every half hour when he leaves work at 16:30 until 19:00. The stock market is still open and he might get an urgent message from colleagues in London. When he wakes he checks to see if colleagues in the US or Singapore have been in touch. \"I don't think a ban would work. If Norway bans my company from sending emails to me then my company needs to make sure someone is able to cover the request that should have been in my inbox.\" The industry would find a way around it, he argues. Like many other lawyers, Lilley checks work email every hour or so during the evening and the same on holiday. In the days before smartphones he would receive phone calls. An email is less intrusive, he argues. \"The ability to be contactable on email means that a lot of people leave the office earlier than otherwise would be the case.\" It can be inconvenient of course. \"You can't deny there are occasions where you think I'd prefer to finish what I'm doing. I've had to stop working out in the gym to reply to a work email.\" But if you want to do a certain kind of legal work you have to be willing to be interrupted, he argues. And there is reassurance in knowing that colleagues can get hold of you to check crucial details. In the office we shop, email friends and go to the gym - the only thing we don't do much of is work. Meanwhile, at home we do our work email, take part in conference calls, write reports and have our best ideas, says Lucy Kellaway. Paul Sellers, TUC policy adviser, says the same problem that France is seeking to address exists in the UK.  He says people in the law, media, finance and local government are not being allowed to switch off. \"Why are we expecting people to work at 8.30 at night?\" The Working Time Regulations were drawn up in the 1990s before mobile phones were in wide circulation. The rules have not caught up.  NHS workers are paid to be on call even if they end up not working. \"If you're not being paid you're not being valued,\" Sellers says.  But another view is that leisure and work now increasingly blend into one. The new reality is that  , Financial Times columnist Lucy Kellaway has argued.  A ban on email is not the answer, argues Ksenia Zheltoukhova, research associate at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. It could even hurt workers who increasingly require flexible working - keeping in touch on trains, emailing between time zones and leaving early to look after the children. A better approach is to educate managers about work-life balance and encourage them to prioritise.  For some employees, the problem is not the email itself, but the collateral damage to loved ones.  \"For me out of hours emails go with the territory,\" says the advertising consultant. \"But my partner does mind.\" Lilley once thought he'd perfected the discreet glance at the phone during dinner. Now he's not so sure. \"I suspect you're more distracted in company than you think you are. It can be very irritating to people around you.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26958079", "title": ["Could work emails be banned after 6pm?"]},

Current account holder Charlotte Brooks on why she switched banks More than 600,000 people have changed their current account provider in the first six months of a scheme designed to make switching banks easier. The 609,300 switches in the six months to the end of March marked an increase of 14% on the same period a year ago. Two thirds of customers are now aware of the service, according to the Payments Council, which oversees it.  But, with 46 million current account holders in the UK, switching levels remain relatively low. The Payments Council said the new, quicker service had taken the \"fear factor\" and \"barriers\" away from switching. Under the new rules current account holders should be able to move their bank account to another provider within seven days. It had taken up to 30 days to switch previously. The switching guarantee also means the new bank or building society has to arrange for the transfer of all existing incoming and outgoing payments to the new account. \"By making the Current Account Switch Service quick, hassle-free and removing the fear factor, we've taken away the barriers customers told us they had when it came to switching,\" said Gary Hocking, managing director of the Payments Council. Current accounts should also not be ignored when it comes to shopping around for the best rate\u201d \"There's also been a noticeable surge of advertising activity from current account providers, big and small, suggesting that the new service is helping foster competition and choice for customers.\" However, some have questioned the success of the new scheme. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: \"Despite an increase in public awareness and confidence, switching levels are still low, suggesting that the new seven-day service is not the game-changer that can significantly increase competition in banking.\" Tesco Bank and Virgin Money plan to launch current accounts this year, while existing providers have offered a range of incentives for customers to change or stick with their current bank, from interest on balances to one-off cash payments. Some current accounts now offer three times the interest rate of some instant access savings accounts, according to price comparison website Moneysupermarket. \"Current accounts should also not be ignored when it comes to shopping around for the best rate - especially as providers are also offering cash incentives to those who switch,\" said Kevin Mountford, head of banking at the website. \"However, people should be aware of high overdraft charges on some of these accounts.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that \"even the most astute consumer could struggle to understand what they are paying for\" with an unarranged overdraft. An estimated \u00a38bn is owed to banks and building societies through overdrafts. A banking trade body said overdraft charges had plummeted. The FCA will investigate the market over the summer. The regulator studied overdrafts that come as part of a current account, as well as unarranged overdrafts, where banks and building societies allow customers to go beyond their overdraft limit. It found that many people were confused about the costs and that overdrafts were not providing good value. \"Just about everybody who banks can have access to some sort of overdraft facility - whether they have signed up for it or not,\" said Christopher Woolard, director of policy at the FCA.  If you are unhappy with how much you are being charged, we recommend you shop around\u201d \"The sheer size of this market is huge and with overdrafts bolted on to over 30 million UK current accounts, we want to make sure it is working well for consumers.\" The regulator said that people failed to switch banks on the basis of overdrafts, so there was little pressure on banks to ensure these products offered good value. It also said that it was too simplistic for banks to claim that overdrafts subsidise the fact that there is no specific charge to open a bank account. The British Bankers' Association, which represents the major banks, said that overdrafts were still a good option for many people. \"Millions of people find overdrafts are an easy way to borrow money, more flexible and convenient than taking out a loan,\" said Eric Leenders, the BBA's executive director in charge of retail.  \"Anyone who uses this type of borrowing receives details of how much they are charged in their accounts statements.\" Overdraft charges were the subject of a major court battle four years ago. Banks defeated the Office of Fair Trading's attempt to regulate bank charges following the long-running legal case, but many have since made changes to their charging structures. They also had to process millions of complaints about charges, with payments made to many thousands of customers. \"Overdraft charges have plummeted in recent years, with estimated savings of up to \u00a3928m for customers since 2008,\" Mr Leenders said. \"But if you are unhappy with how much you are being charged, we recommend you shop around for an account better suited to your needs.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26973751", "title": ["Overdrafts complex and poor value, says FCA"]},

Meanwhile, providers will contact pension customers if recent decisions are affected by the new reforms.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Whole Foods bosses on sharing leadership: \"It's like a marriage\" Would you feel uncomfortable chatting to your boss in your pyjamas? How about brushing your teeth together in the morning, or preparing breakfast with one another? While sleepovers are standard fare when you're a child, spending the night with your boss is a level of intimacy that most people would rather avoid. But for Whole Foods Market chief executive and founder John Mackey, escaping the constraints of the office and spending time with colleagues in a more personal setting is the best way to build up a trusting relationship. \"I know this sounds weird, but there's something about sleeping in the same house and then fixing breakfast or dinner together that is very much a bonding experience,\" he says. People have got to have that sense that their work matters\u201d This level of personal interaction, says Mr Mackey, prevents staff compartmentalising their work life and personal life, and means workers can relate on a deeper level. His approach stresses the importance of emotionally involved leadership and creating a culture that allows workers to flourish. Gallup's most recent study of   in the US workplace found an alarming 70% of those surveyed either hated their jobs or were completely disengaged.  Right from when he founded the natural and organic food firm in 1980 with just one store and 19 staff, Mr Mackey has been on a mission to change this.  The company now has 80,000 staff across 373 shops in the US, Canada and the UK, but his main objective remains ensuring employees feel valued and that their work is more than just a pay cheque. \"If you want to create a good culture and a good company then people have got to have that sense that their work matters and that they matter.\" To get this across, Mr Mackey says \"caring leadership\" is emphasised from the top down, with a conscious effort not to promote \"the jerks\". You have to create a culture where everybody has an opportunity to be recognised\u201d This isn't just rhetoric. In each store, workers are divided into eight teams in different departments.  When new employees join they are assigned to a team and put on two months' probation. Only when they are approved by at least two-thirds of their team members in a secret ballot can they stay on permanently. While it is easy to be sceptical about an approach that appears to have come straight from the 1960s hippie era, the results suggest it is very effective. For the 2013 financial year,  .

And for the past 17 years in a row, it has been listed as one of the   in the US by Fortune magazine.  Part of its appeal for workers is the consensual culture. Even the very top job is shared, with Mr Mackey leading the firm alongside co-chief executive Walter Robb.  This approach continues throughout the firm, with individual stores having control over budgets and staff having the power to make decisions. Mr Mackey says this \"decentralisation\" approach differs from the standard corporate chain model and helps to drive innovation.  One idea that came via this process is the \"tap room\" - an in-store beer and wine bar that lets customers nibble on food while sampling local wine and beers by the glass. It started out in one store after an employee came up with the idea, but has now been rolled out to more than 100 stores. Mr Mackey believes most chief executives are afraid of handing their staff this level of responsibility, mainly because they fear they will lose control.  He admits the approach can be messy and inefficient, with time wasted duplicating existing ideas, but says the upside - \"a much more dynamic and turned on workforce\" - is worth it.  Pay is equally egalitarian. The seven-strong executive team, which includes the co-chief executives, all earn the same salary, which is capped at 19 times the average pay of a full-time worker. And it ends all meetings with what it calls \"appreciations\", thanking people on the team for specific contributions to the firm, a simple idea that Mr Mackey says has had a \"huge revolutionary impact\" in terms of improving staff relations. \"You have to create a culture where everybody has an opportunity to be recognised,\" he says.

{"article": "A vote for Scottish independence would delay the UK's return to triple A credit status, according to the ratings agency, Fitch. The agency said there would be a \"one off\" increase in the UK's debt if Scotland left the UK. It said it expected any transition to independence to be managed carefully, with compromises on either side. And it would be in the rest of the UK's interests to make an independent Scotland \"a success\", it argued. In its report, Fitch said it assumed a No vote was most likely in September's referendum, based on current polls, but a Yes vote would mean it would review the UK's credit rating. It has been more than a year since the UK lost its AAA credit rating and although the government have downplayed the significance of ratings, the prospect of waiting longer before getting the top rating back will not delight anyone in the Treasury. Fitch had said before that Scottish independence was unlikely to impact the UK credit rating, but recent developments have changed their mind. Today's report focuses on UK debt and its impact on the credit rating.  They say that the commitment the UK government made in January to honour all the debt already issued - even the chunk that an independent Scotland would take on - would bump up the UK's debt to GDP ratio. Fitch say that would delay the possibility of the UK getting its AAA credit rating back again, because having a bigger debt burden is seen as more risky.  That's a concern for the UK government because when ratings agencies like Fitch lower their ratings, investors see it as a more risky loan, so countries have to pay more in interest. The agency's report said there would be \"moderate risks\" in the areas of public debt, external finances, currency arrangements and the financial sector. The Scottish government has said that, if voters back Yes in September's independence referendum, it regards 24 March 2016 to be \" \". Fitch said the UK's government's undertaking to honour all of the UK's debt would lead to \"a one-off increase of 9.5% of GDP\" in the UK debt ratio if Scotland became independent in 2016. \"We assume Scotland would gradually repay its loan to the UK,\" the report said. \"However, it would be illiquid and leave the UK exposed to Scottish credit risk, at least in the early years of independence.\" It would be in the best economic interests of the UK to ensure that an independent Scotland was, in the broadest terms, 'a success'\u201d Fitch said independence would \"likely be mildly negative for the UK's balance of payments\" as the UK would lose most of its oil export receipts to Scotland. The report said that all of the possible currency options, \"from a pegged or free-floating currency to a currency union\", would pose risks to the remaining UK, including \"competitive devaluation\". But it said that Fitch would expect a compromise could be reached between Scotland and the rest of the UK in any transitional negotiations. \"It would be in the best economic interests of the UK to ensure that an independent Scotland was, in the broadest terms, 'a success'\", it said. The agency added that some financial institutions could move their headquarters to London in the event of independence, which would \"expand the size of the UK banking sector from an already high level of 492% of GDP; it would also increase cross-border and potentially cross-currency exposure\". In a previous assessment in 2012 the agency had concluded that Scottish independence would be likely to be neutral for the UK's credit rating, but said it had revised its view as it could no longer assume there would be \"no impact on gross public debt\". In its new report it added: \"We expect a compromise would be reached that is not punitive for either party. Given the institutional strength of the UK, we would expect the transition to be managed very carefully, avoiding major financial dislocations. Were this not the case the pressure on the ratings would be much higher\". The UK Treasury produced analysis predicting an independent Scotland would have the second highest deficit amongst advanced economies in its first year. The Treasury analysis said Scotland would have a fiscal deficit of 5.5% of GDP in 2016-17, the equivalent to \u00a39.5bn, or \u00a31,760 per head of population. The total would be about \u00a31,000 more than the UK deficit per head in the same year, the Treasury said, contradicting Scottish government estimates of a deficit between 2.5% and 3.2%. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: \"A range of independent experts, including the IFS, CPPR, Citigroup, and now Fitch all show that the broad shoulders of the UK mean lower tax bills and higher spending on public services in Scotland.\" But a Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"This Fitch report shows exactly why it will be in the overwhelming economic interests of the rest of the UK to negotiate fairly and openly with Scotland following a vote for independence, ensuring a smooth transition. \"Their analysis makes clear the implication of Westminster's announcement that it would honour all existing debt. \"It also makes clear the potential implications for the rest of the UK's credit rating and its balance of payments. \"The Scottish government has outlined that we would take responsibility for our fair share of debt, and agree to service this alongside a wider agreement on assets and a formal currency union.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26974826", "title": ["Scottish independence: Yes vote could mean UK credit rating review, says Fitch"]},
{"article": "Under eerie blue lights designed to simulate the ocean depths, hundreds of fish swim serenely through the bubbling waters of their circular tanks, 15 floors up in the sky. There are 11 plastic tanks in total, holding a combined 80,000 litres of salt water.  They are full of grouper, a white-fleshed fish, which are all destined to end up on the plates of restaurant-goers across Hong Kong. This is the scene at Oceanethix, one of the numerous so-called \"vertical fish farms\" in the special administrative region, which have become a key fixture of its supply chain. If you like, this is rooftop farming on steroids\u201d For while most fish farms around the world are at sea, or at least, land level, in Hong Kong it is more often a necessity to put them many floors up in tall buildings. This is because as one of the most densely populated places in the world, there is simply very little spare space. So fish farms have to fit in where they can. For the small firms that dominate the industry, it is worth the effort, as Hong Kong has an insatiable appetite for fish and seafood. It consumes more than 70kg (11 stone) per capita every year, 10 times more than in the US. \"We're way above the hustle and bustle,\" jokes Lloyd Moskalik, managing director of Oceanethix, which is based in Hong Kong's New Territories. \"If you like, this is rooftop farming on steroids.\" His business, which employs six people in Hong Kong, buys in the groupers as baby fish, or fingerlings. They then take between 10 and 13 months to get up to market weight. If you come here on a Saturday it's an absolute theme park - there are people running everywhere\u201d Oceanethix sells about two tonnes of groupers to fish wholesalers each week, and Mr Moskalik says he can get as much as 776 Hong Kong dollars ($100; \u00a360) per kilogram. As demand for farmed fish has soared in the region, wholesale prices have risen at a rate of between 10% and 15% per annum for the past five years. Oceanethix also sells its water-recycling systems to other companies across Asia setting up similar fish farms in the sky. \"We've been selected by the Korean government as part of an ambitious plan to establish vertical farms in multi-story buildings... in Seoul,\" says Mr Moskalik. The Singapore government has also bought a country licence for Oceanethix's water-recycling systems, and the company has its own sister facility in Shanghai. But it is not just fish farms that have been taking to the skies in Hong Kong, as a growing number of organic fruit and vegetable plots are being created on top of skyscrapers and other spare rooftop spaces. No doubt in part caused by a string of recent food safety scandals in mainland China, from where Hong Kong sources most of its food, a growing number of Hongkongers are wishing to grow their own produce as naturally as possible. Helping to meet this demand is Osbert Lam, the owner of Hong Kong City Farms. From just a hobby 10 years ago, he now runs three farms that convert thousands of square feet of rooftop space into organic plots he rents at about 190 Hong Kong dollars per month. \"We've got a list of about 30 people all waiting to get boxes,\" he says, from the top of a 14-storey industrial estate building in Quarry Bay, in the heart of one of Hong Kong's business districts. \"If you come here on a Saturday it's an absolute theme park - there are people running everywhere.\" He says the urban farms reveal just how shallow Hong Kong's urban roots are. \"Many of the people that come here are not even two or three generations away from the land,\" says Mr Lam. \"In many cases, it's just one generation before they were from farming families. A lot of people come here with a lot of knowledge.\" The growth of rooftop gardens has also meant more business for Hong Kong's urban beekeepers. Michael Leung, founder of HK Honey, is always on the look out for new places to put his hives, and to help him locate them, he looks up for papaya trees. \"The papaya tree grows very well in Hong Kong - most people, if they grow anything on the roof, it's a papaya,\" he says. \"The height of the tree allows you from ground level to see that someone is using the rooftop.  \"We're always looking for little trees that stick out. They're like a flag, a modern agricultural flag,\" he says. \"Through that, we then try to approach the people growing on the roof.\" Mr Leung then arranges to rent space for his hives. He says that the honey his bees produce has a spicy tang, which reflects the biodiversity of Hong Kong's urban flora, and particularly the Chinese basil many people like to grow. Such is the quality of Mr Leung's honey that he is able to sell it for a whopping 240 Hong Kong dollars per jar. For Hong Kong's larger commercial organic farming operations, which buy produce from Hong Kong's dwindling slivers of agricultural land near the border with China, the continuous pressure on agricultural land from developers could mean that rooftop farms will one day be all that's left to the special administration region, which even now produces 2% of the food it consumes. Todd Darling, of Homegrown Foods, an organic grocery delivery business in Hong Kong, said permissive zoning regulations make it more cost effective for owners of agricultural land to store shipping containers on the space than to farm it. In the meantime, however, the food scandals that creep across the border from mainland China have, perversely, been good for his organic business.  \"I would never like to say that, but it does tend to encourage people to consider alternatives,\" he says.

{"article": "The sale of long term debt by the Greek government was eight times over subscribed, the government has said. Greece's deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos said demand for 3bn euros (\u00a32.4bn) worth of five year bonds proved the country's debt is sustainable. The sale attracted interest from 550 investors. Greece is retuning to the capital markets for the first time since its economy nearly collapsed in 2010.  The Greek government had initially priced the bond to provide a return of between 5% and 5.25%.  But with investor orders running at 20bn euros (\u00a316.5bn) it was able to lower the yield to 4.95% - far lower than analysts had expected.  This is certainly an important moment in the eurozone's rehabilitation after the financial crisis.   That Greece was able to borrow five year money at all is mark of progress of sorts, when you consider that private sector creditors have already taken severe losses.  They had a very short \"haircut\" to use the financial jargon. It was also remarkable that Greece managed to achieve an annual borrowing cost of less than 5%.   Last year, the government managed what's called a primary surplus in its finances, that's to say tax and other revenue covered all spending, except interest payments.  But let's not get carried away. Greece has an enormous burden of outstanding debt.   So why are markets relatively comfortable with lending to Greece?  They probably assume that the rest of the eurozone would, reluctantly, come to the country's aid yet again rather than allow a default.  The country still has a \"junk\" credit rating, nine notches below investment grade at Caa3 by Moody's. Standard and Poor's and Fitch rank Greece six notches below investment grade at B-. Greece has been locked out of capital markets by high borrowing costs since 2010. The bond sale comes almost four years to the day the government said it could no longer fund itself. It received an international bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Union (EU) and a further bailout two years later as well as loans of 240bn euros. The bailouts were granted on condition Greece imposed a series of deeply resented spending cuts and tax hikes.  However, the country's interest rates have been falling recently as its public finances have improved following tough austerity measures. The bond sale came amid reports that a car bomb had exploded outside one of the Bank of Greece's offices in central Athens at dawn.  Police, blamed leftwing or anarchist extremists, but said no one was injured.  Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel is due to make an official visit to the country on Friday. Many Greeks blame Germany for insisting on spending cuts and tax increases in return for loans. On Wednesday thousands of striking Greeks marched on parliament to protest against job and spending cuts. More than 20,000 people marched peacefully through the streets of Athens chanting: \"EU, IMF take the bailout and get out of here!\" The 24-hour strike left schools and pharmacies shut, ships docked at ports and hospitals operating with only emergency staff. Greeks have lost about a third of their disposable income since the debt crisis started and unemployment has soared, leaving more than one in four without a job. Turnout at the march, which lasted two hours, was similar to protests held during the last nationwide strike in November, according to the Reuters news agency. The country's economic output has shrunk by a quarter and unemployment remains close to 28%. There are fewer Greeks employed than at any time in the past 33 years. In recent weeks, the Greek parliament agreed further austerity measures - including the sacking of 11,000 public sector workers - in exchange for the latest instalment of bailout money.  Last month, Greek lender Piraeus Bank sold its first bond in more than four years. The bond offered investors a yield of 5.125% and now trades with a yield of about 4.125%.

The lack of homes for sale was a \"major concern\" and there was a \"desperate need\" for more, the Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said. Buyer inquiries rose in every area of the UK except Wales in March, its latest survey found. Various surveys suggest house prices are still below their peak. The Rics report said that house prices \"continue along their upward trajectory\" as the economy recovers, with the survey recording an 11th month of house price rises. Many more surveyors expect prices to rise in the next three months and the next year, compared with the number of surveyors predicting price falls. The survey suggested that prices would rise by 6% a year, on average, over the next five years. \"It is a major concern that we are not seeing enough houses coming on to the market,\" said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics. \"For the market to operate effectively, we desperately need more homes in areas where people want to buy and want to live.  \"Until this happens, we are likely to see prices continue to increase and it is going to be ever harder for many first-time buyers to conceive of ever owning their own home.\" Many potential first-time buyers have found it easier to secure a mortgage owing to greater competition in the home loans market, but price rises - especially in the south-east of England - have made ownership unaffordable for some.

{"article": "Adrin Loi, 59, executive chairman of Ya Kun Coffee International, never set out to be Singapore's coffee king. The youngest of seven in a close-knit Chinese-Singaporean family, Mr Loi grew up working with his brothers and sisters in his father Ah Koon's humble coffee stall. \"I was very good at making toast,\" he says with a laugh. Mr Loi's father, known as Ya Kun, a bastardisation of his Chinese name, operated from Telok Ayer Square and later the Lau Pa Sat hawker centre, serving the classic Singapore breakfast offering: runny eggs, coffee and toast spread with kaya, a jam made of coconut milk and flavoured with pandan leaves. But when Mr Koon fell ill, after serving hungry crowds for more than 60 years, Mr Loi felt that it would be a shame if the family business disappeared. Most of his siblings were all older - his eldest sister is 20 years his senior - and did not want to take over the stand. But Mr Loi, who had seen the easy rapport his father had with his customers, and in return the loyalty they showed him, wanted to keep that essence alive. So one day he and his brother, Algie, finally worked up the courage to ask his father if they could take over running his stall. Sure, his father said - but it is very hard work. \"So he challenged us - do you think you can do it?\" says Mr Loi. The answer was almost instantly a resounding yes. After taking over from his father in 1998, Mr Loi and his brother were forced to relocate the business because of construction at Lau Pa Sat. They renamed the coffee stall Ya Kun Kaya Toast, and borrowed 10,000 Singapore dollars ($8,000; \u00a34,700) to get the business up and running. Mr Loi says his wife helped him write the tagline \"Coffeestall since 1944\", to place a large focus on the family history - which became even more important when his father died in 1999. The publicity materials for the new stall highlighted the story of how Mr Loi's father fled to Singapore on a junk boat from Hainan, China, in search of a new life in 1926, and how he worked his way up from coffee assistant to running his own stall. Although Mr Loi says he was anxious - renting the 1,000 sq ft (90sq m) space cost a considerable sum - within two weeks the new stall had already broken even. \"We realised, hey this is a good business, because my dad really built a name for himself,\" he says. After that initial success, Mr Loi brought in consultants to see if he needed to get outside investment to help the company grow. In the end, he decided instead to apply for a grant from the Singaporean government instead of diluting his ownership share, which is now around 75%, after he bought out one partner and his brother reduced his holdings. I hope to slowly pass on my skill and my knowledge to my son so that one day he can take over my business\u201d That grant allowed him to investigate franchising opportunities - which he says was a resounding success, with more than 400 applications from potential franchisee owners in just six months. Since then, he has grown the business to more than 50 Ya Kun coffee shops in Singapore as well as 49 outlets across the globe, from Indonesia to Abu Dhabi. Last year the company's turnover was approximately 25m Singapore dollars - a 2,000% increase since Mr Loi took over in 1998. \"Singapore is one of the most cosmopolitan countries in the world,\" says Mr Loi.  That helps Ya Kun, because while workers are posted to the city state, they are exposed to Ya Kun's brand - so that when they see an outlet when they return home to say, Indonesia, they will often continue patronising the chain. Mr Loi says that the peculiarity of Singaporean eating habits has also helped the company grow. \"In Singapore, most people eat five meals a day - they have breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and supper. So every now and then they will come for coffee and then come back again,\" he says. That has helped Ya Kun become a household name, prompting one blogger to ask recently: \"Is there anyone here who has never eaten at Ya Kun?\" Mr Loi has also expanded the menu offerings to including noodle soups and other lunch dishes, as well as different types of toast and coffee. He says that he is lucky that his family have been incredibly supportive as the company has thrived. \"Once you have a lot of siblings there can be sibling rivalry - but not with us,\" he says. \"Even though we have grown so big, they don't envy me and they're still helping out in the business,\" adding that several family members continue to run individual stores. He says they joke that his dad would rise from the dead if he saw how far his humble stall has gone. \"He never would have expected how far we've grown,\" Mr Loi says with pride.

{"article": "The cost of home improvements could double if professional builders have to solve botched DIY jobs first, a building expert has warned. Harvey Ellingham, boss of Home Improvements Guarantee, said that pride often led to DIY disasters at this time of year. A survey, by the Nationwide Building Society, suggests that DIY projects cost an average of \u00a33,342. But one expert told BBC News that enthusiasts often overspent. Jo Behari, a former City worker who founded Home Jane, a team of handywomen and home improvement specialists, said that spring was a good time to look out for bargains. This time of year is the most popular for homeowners to start DIY projects. The Nationwide survey suggested that nearly half of those asked were planning a project and were willing to spend thousands of pounds. This average bill increased for the older generation, with those aged over 55 spending \u00a34,045. Richard Napier, director for savings and mortgages at the Nationwide, said there was an \"appetite\" for people to invest in their homes.  However, 7% of people aged 18 to 24 were willing to use a credit card to fund this work, with another 4% happy to turn to payday loans to finance it. Mr Ellingham, who has been in the building trade for 20 years, said that people risked a big bill by failing to do their homework. Overlooking an extension being built by professionals at a home in Sutton, west London, he said that people risked damage to their homes and their health if they did not plan DIY work sufficiently. \"If you are going to put a nail into a wall, you need to know what is behind that wall. If you are going to put a nail into the floor, you need to know whether there are pipes under there,\" he said. \"It is common sense, but some people believe they know what they are doing and go full-steam ahead.\" But mistakes are not just made by people who only work on their own homes. A survey by the TrustMark accredited trader scheme found that incompetent tradesmen have cost UK homeowners an estimated \u00a31.9bn over the last year. Ms Behari said that some DIY enthusiasts failed to learn the basics about their home and were too embarrassed to admit they had a problem. She also said that people did not need to spend as much as they did at this time of year. She suggested: \"Make sure you don't buy ridiculously expensive tools; I know it is easy to get carried away,\" she said.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. The BBC's Michelle Fleury talks to World Bank president Jim Yong Kim about attempts to reduce extreme poverty. Economic growth is \"not enough\" to end global poverty, the World Bank has said. It has urged developing countries to allocate more resources to their extreme poor, including through bigger welfare programmes. The bank, which last year set itself the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030,  said such measures would increase productivity and growth. But the impact on poverty of growth alone has its limits, the bank said. \"Even if all countries grow at the same rates as over the past 20 years, and if the income distribution remains unchanged, world poverty will only fall by 10% by 2030, from 17.7% in 2010,\" said World Bank president Jim Yong Kim. \"This is simply not enough, and we need a laser-like focus on making growth more inclusive and targeting more programmes to assist the poor directly if we're going to end extreme poverty.\"  to help end extreme poverty through welfare schemes, such as rewards for those who enrol their children at school or receive regular health checks. This, it believes, would lift the incomes of the poorest, who would then be able to contribute to broader growth. To achieve its 2030 target, the bank estimates the extreme poor - those earning less than $1.25 (74p) a day - will have to decrease by 50 million people each year until 2030.  That is the equivalent of a million people each week for the next 16 years. \"This will be extraordinarily difficult, but I believe we can do it,\" said Mr Kim, at the start of the bank's spring meeting. \"This can be the generation that ends extreme poverty.\" The country with the biggest extreme poverty is the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 88% of the population is below the poverty line. It is followed by Liberia, where 84% of people are in extreme poverty, and Burundi and Madagascar, where the figure is 81%.

{"article": "Russia has threatened to cut gas supplies to Ukraine because of the dispute over prices. That could also affect EU countries, as much Russian gas is delivered to the West through Ukraine. We examine what's behind the row, and its potential impact on Europe and its gas supplies.  The immediate dispute is about Ukraine's very large unpaid gas bill: $2.2bn (\u00a31.2bn; 1.4bn euros), according to the Russian state-controlled utility Gazprom.  If Ukraine does not settle its bill, Gazprom will in effect install the world's largest pre-pay meter, and Ukraine will be obliged to pay for its gas in advance. If it fails to pay, Gazprom says it will restrict or suspend delivery.  But lurking behind this is the power struggle between the interim Ukrainian government, which leans towards the EU, and Russia, which wants to keep Ukraine firmly within its sphere of influence.  In February, months of street protests culminated in the removal from power of Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. He had decided not to sign an association agreement with the EU, opting instead to join Russia's customs union.  But the interim government has reversed course. In return, the EU is providing development assistance, a loan of 1.6bn euros (\u00a31.3bn; $2.2bn), the temporary removal of customs duties on Ukrainian exports to the EU, and a programme to lessen Ukraine's energy dependence on Russia. That has angered the Kremlin. Gazprom has raised the price Ukraine will have to pay for its gas in future by 81%: up to $485.50 (\u00a3293; 354 euros) from $268.50 for 1,000 cubic metres. Previously, Ukraine's gas imports were subsidised in return for Russia's lease of the naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea, the home of the Russian Black Sea fleet. But since Russia annexed Crimea last month, that agreement is no longer valid.  Quite possibly - the EU gets about a third of its gas from Russia, with some 50% of this flowing through Ukraine.  Outside Ukraine, two other pipelines link Russia to the EU: the North Stream (under the Baltic) and the Yamal, which flows through Belarus and Poland.  Germany and Italy are the two biggest customers for Russian gas. However, Germany is building more coal-fired power plants and renewable energy installations, including offshore wind farms.  Source: Oxford Institute for Energy Studies Italy 25.33 15.08 Turkey 13 14.02 Germany 11.71 21 Czech Republic 7.32 7.28 Hungary 6 5.29 Slovakia 5.42 4.19 Another pipeline, the South Stream, is under construction, running from Russia under the Black Sea to Bulgaria and then splitting into two branches, north through Hungary to Austria, and south to Italy. The project website says the South Stream is scheduled to begin supplying gas late next year and  .  However, the EU could decide to freeze construction as part of a further round of sanctions on Russia.  Interconnectors between different pipelines could also help. South-eastern EU countries such as Austria and the Czech Republic receive their supplies via Ukraine and are most at risk if Russia turns off the taps. However, they could receive relief supplies via the interconnectors flowing down from Germany.  Other countries, such as Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland, are looking to diversify their energy supplies, for example by bringing in more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from non-European countries, such as Qatar, or shale gas from North America.  One factor working in the favour of EU consumers is the weather: energy use falls in summer, reducing dependence on imports.  Yes - repeatedly.  The first instance was on New Year's Day 2006. Russia wanted to increase the price per 1,000 cubic metres by more than 400%. When Ukraine said no, Russia turned off the taps.  Within hours, other countries - including Austria, France, Germany and Italy - began reporting pressure drops in their pipelines of about 30%. The dispute was settled three days later, but prompted much nervousness in the EU about its dependence on Russian energy.  Three years later, again on New Year's Day, Russia again cut supplies. This was during a very cold spell, leaving countries such as Bulgaria and Slovakia with serious cuts to supplies. Industrial plants were shut down, while people struggled to heat homes and schools.  After more than two weeks of shortages, Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement that was supposed to run for 10 years.  However, with the political turmoil in Ukraine, the gas dispute has flared again. The   of using energy supplies to control Ukraine.  Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia has been subsidising Ukraine with cheap gas. Traditionally, more than 50% of Ukraine's gas needs have came from Russia, although the country has also been a big importer from Turkmenistan. Last year, Gazprom exported about 26 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to Ukraine, more than half the 50.4bcm it consumed. Although Ukraine's nuclear and coal sectors produce more electricity than gas, the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES) says that \"industry and municipal infrastructure are highly dependent on gas\".  The OIES estimates that Ukraine's gas requirement for this year will be about 50bcm, with about 20bcm produced inside the country. If the worst came to the worst, and Russia halted supplies, Ukraine would have to find alternative suppliers for some 30bcm. Talks are under way within the EU about helping Ukraine in an emergency by sending gas via pipelines in Slovakia.  Almost certainly.  The question is, would President Putin be prepared to suffer short-term pain for long-term gain (whatever that gain might be)? The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies estimates that last year, 53% of Gazprom's export revenues - or $33.3bn - went through Ukraine.  Any escalation of the gas dispute could seriously dent Moscow's tax earnings. It may also be a reputational disaster. Gazprom, and Russia generally, won't want to be known as an unreliable supplier.  That would curtail international investment in the country's oil and gas sectors, and spur on the West to find alternative sources of energy.

{"article": "As the celebrated architect Frank Gehry unveiled his contribution to redeveloping London's Battersea power station he felt it necessary to say, \"I want to create a set of buildings people will want to live in,\" as if there were an alternative aspiration.    He was addressing a concern that London's luxury new-build property market is becoming a repository for the wealth of the global super-rich. As such, many argue it is doing nothing to ease the city's acute housing crisis - especially if the new homes are left empty.    Figures compiled by the global real estate consultancy Knight Frank show that for the two years to June 2013, 69% of new-build buyers in the prime central London market were not British. Almost half, 49%, were not resident in the UK - thus raising the fear that homes have been bought purely as an investment and may be left empty.   In an earlier phase of the development of the Thames-side Battersea power station, half the apartments built in former power station's shell were sold outside the UK.      The chief executive of the Battersea Power Station Development Company, Rob Tincknell, is aware that empty properties create a perception problem.  \"If this place doesn't work and there's nobody living here, it just won't function properly,\" he says. \"It is essential we do what we can to make sure our homes are occupied, and we're doing everything possible\".  It is not contributing anything to the community because it is empty\u201d \"You can't stop investors buying, but even if they do they're going to rent these properties out because people will want to live here - they will be great investments.\" Walking beneath One St George Wharf, another luxury tower development along the river from the Battersea site, I meet a woman walking her dog.  \"There's no way normal Londoners can live here, no way,\" she says.    She agrees rich foreign buyers are squeezing out local people though she accepts it is \"not their intention - it is just they have the money and the wherewithal.\"    \"It's out of most people's range,\" says a man eating a sandwich as he enjoys the new riverside walkway.  \"Youngsters coming on the market don't have a chance.\"  Across London I meet Westminster councillor David Boothroyd outside one of London's most controversial new-build properties. One Hyde Park is a luxury development with, as the name implies, views of Hyde Park itself.  \"It is the most luxurious block of flats you could ever imagine in London and they sell for about \u00a370m each.\" The population of London is growing by about 100,000 each year - but we're only building about 18-20,000 new homes\u201d \"It turns out there's almost no one actually living here,\" he says. The flats themselves are mostly investment properties and it is easier for the owners to keep them empty than have the hassle of renting them out, he says.   \"It is not contributing anything to the community because it is empty.\" He surveyed his central London borough, Westminster, and found that even though the number of homes had increased, the number of voters and council tax payers had fallen because so many properties were unoccupied.  However, Grainne Gilmore, head of residential research at estate agents Knight Frank, argues that those who leave properties empty are few and far between. \"It is a very small slice of the market. As you move up the value chain you have billionaires - globally wealthy people - who own homes all around the world and they spend a fraction of their time in each.  \"They are different from the investors, they want to keep their homes for their use only, but it really is at the top end of the market and it is a small fragment of homes in the capital.\" Despite anecdotal evidence of foreign buyers stoking house price inflation by purchasing normal residential properties, research by Knight Frank suggests that away from the prime central London locations, foreign non-resident buyers - at least of new-build homes - are less active.   Source: Knight Frank More than 79% of all new homes, even in inner London, are bought by UK residents and in outer London the figure is more than 93%, according to Knight Frank.  \"We do not have enough supply of homes in the capital and that has driven up pricing. Houses are not being built full stop,\" says Grainne Gilmore.  Much of the building that is taking place is aimed at the top end of the market. According to the property consultancy EC Harri, the next decade will see 20,000 prime residential units completed in London, with a sales value of \u00a350bn.     Prof Tony Travers, who is local government expert at the London School of Economics, agrees and says that London's rapid house price inflation is more to do with the lack of building than with foreign buyers.   \"The population of London is growing by about 100,000 each year, but we're only building about 18-20,000 new homes.\"  Back at Battersea Power Station the modest plans for affordable homes, just 15% of the total, have drawn stiff criticism. And only half of those are expected to be social housing, accepts Rob Tincknell.   So the homes ordinary Londoners can afford are simply not being built.    Battersea Power Station stopped generating electricity in 1983 and since then differing development proposals have come and gone - but this one, backed by Malaysian money, looks likely to succeed.   A much-loved building will have been given a new lease of life, yet most of the 3,444 new homes will be beyond ordinary Londoners' reach.  For most, London will have gained another neighbourhood to look at rather than live in.

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Rory Cellan-Jones tests out the Samsung S5 The Galaxy S5's new heart rate reader could come in useful for Samsung Electronic's investors. The South Korean firm warned earlier this week that it expected its profits to fall for the second quarter running.  Several analysts suggest the high-end market is becoming saturated, meaning most people wanting a premium phone already own one, making it harder to sell them another.  \"Year to date, the share price of Samsung Electronics continues to underperform both in absolute terms and against the Kospi [Korea Composite Stock Price Index] as well,\" Taewoo Kim, portfolio manager of Fidelity's Korea fund tells the BBC. \"This weak performance reflected investors' concerns on its smartphone business particularly in the high-end segment as a result of elevated competition.\" But Mr Kim believes things are about to improve, thanks in part to the improving performance of Samsung Electronic's memory and home appliance divisions. The new Galaxy could guarantee such a turnaround if consumers warm to its water-resistant build, improved camera and fitness-tracking facilities. To mark the S5's global launch the BBC asked five experts for their thoughts: Samsung has packed in all the latest technology to make this a powerhouse\u201d The Samsung Galaxy S5 plays it safe on design, sticking to a tried and tested formula with its plastic body and chrome-trimmed finish.  There's plenty of grip around the back and you still have the advantage of being able to change the battery, both to the phone's credit. Under the hood Samsung has packed in all the latest technology to make this a powerhouse.  There's raw processing power and battery performance to get you though the day, fronted by a stunning 5.1in (13cm) display, with a camera that offers nice vibrant photos and the option for 4K ultra-high definition video capture, ready for the next generation. But the implementation of the fingerprint scanner isn't as tidy as the iPhone and we're not convinced that the heart rate sensor was a feature that anybody was crying out for.  There is a huge number of features on offer making for a super-connected device, but we feel the user interface could be a little slicker and faster.  The Samsung Galaxy S5 is undoubtedly a great device, we're just not convinced it's the greatest. A heart rate monitor... is hard to see as much more than a gimmick\u201d The Samsung S5 launch was largely underwhelming and I think that most consumers will be hard pressed to tell the difference between the new phone and last year's model. Whereas handset launches used to have us on the edge of our seats, they have increasingly lost their wow factor.  This is symptomatic of the maturity of the smartphone market, where ground-breaking innovations are hard to come by.  Take the S5 - one of its headline features is a heart rate monitor, which is hard to see as much more than a gimmick.  It's true that consumers do use heart rate monitors for running and cycling, but these activities demand specialist devices that provide the constant monitoring required, rather than the one-off measurements offered by the S5. And this perhaps shows us where innovation will come from in the future, where the individual functions of the device are broken out into wearable devices and accessories that connect back into a smartphone.  Of course Samsung itself is not blind to this trend and spent almost an equal amount of time at the S5 launch talking about its new smartwatches and connected fitness band.  The smartphone isn't going away any time soon, but if you are looking for the latest innovations then look instead at the myriad of wearables and smart accessories that are starting to flood on to the market. [Samsung] hires the best and brightest from Korea and increasingly abroad\u201d Samsung Electronics is now the biggest tech company in the world by revenue, with leadership in many product categories.  However, its shares trade at a deep discount to peers on all metrics as investors worry about saturation of the high-end smartphone market and the increasing challenge from Chinese rivals. The company is the bellwether of South Korea and the jewel of the Samsung Empire, the largest and most important chaebol - meaning conglomerate - on the Korean peninsula generating hundreds of thousands of jobs.  It is still one of the most prestigious places in Korea to work for new college graduates and as such hires the best and brightest from Korea and increasingly abroad. We believe concerns around the handset business are well overdone.  Although we have seen the fortunes of Nokia, Blackberry and HTC change rapidly, this was all due to the huge shakeout in the smartphone revolution.  Now, we are settling down for a period of more incremental innovations, where scale and breadth wins. Similar to how Nokia dominated the featurephone era, Samsung will continue to dominate this new smartphone era. Beyond scale and breadth, the other massive difference between Samsung and other rivals is its vertical integration including internal manufacturing and core components such as memory, display, processors and batteries.  Together this gives Samsung access to the latest and greatest technologies much faster than competitors, and also allows Samsung to have the lowest cost position. In an era of increased commoditisation, Samsung's cost competitiveness will enable it to continue to make profits while others falter. Consumers are yearning for... more premium materials\u201d With Samsung poised to release its latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S5, there are some of us whose minds are already focused nearly a year down the road: on the presumed Galaxy S6. Unlike this past cycle, the South Korean giant will very likely be forced to make significant upgrades in the area of specifications. While the transition from the S4 to S5 involved only minor spec bumps, we'll probably see Samsung in a position of playing catch up with rival LG, whose upcoming G3 handset is rumoured to feature a higher resolution display.  Likewise, we should see a more substantial jump in processor speeds, as well as a move from 32-bit to 64-bit chip architecture - a choice which would help developers offer the same apps on disparate platforms. Samsung also has a growing problem it needs to address which has nothing to do with spec parity: consumers are yearning for the company to begin employing more premium materials like the aluminium of the HTC One or wood backs on the Moto X. Until Samsung is ready to take mass production to the next level - in the areas of software and hardware alike - there is always going to be a relatively easy marketing strategy rivals can employ to capture market share. Samsung is driven by strong execution- oriented culture\u201d While many Chinese players rush to introduce low-end smartphones at a half or even one-third of the prices of Samsung's, Samsung will not easily lose its market share.   Samsung has invested a lot on its brand for many years and is now considered as cool and sharp among its dedicated users - although not as loyal as Apple's.   Samsung is also trying very hard to create differentiation-based advantages by offering complementary products and services such as wearable pieces, contents and software.   If home electronics networks - including freezers, air-conditioning, washing machines - become a reality in the near future, it will be in the best position to integrate all the devices. While I expect Samsung will not easily lose market share to its competitors, its profit margin will be severely under pressure.  It has already expanded its product offerings in the medium to low-end segments, which will affect its pricing in the high-end segment.  Yet, Samsung is driven by strong execution-oriented culture, and will remain competitive in the future.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26971025", "title": ["Galaxy S5: Expert views on Samsung's latest smartphone"]},
{"article": "When Simeon Penn, director of powerboat experience company Saber Powersports, needed a loan for a new boat, he didn't go to his bank. Instead, he got the money from Funding Circle, an online marketplace that allows individual savers to lend money directly to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Mr Penn's accountant suggested he try this alternative form of funding after the bank failed to respond to his loan request after three weeks. With Funding Circle, the \u00a325,000 that Saber needed was in the company account two weeks later and the application process was very simple, Mr Penn said. Even more unusually, he spoke to a \"real person\" who took an interest in his business. By contrast, the bank \"was making him jump through hoops\", he said. He was so impressed by the process that when he needed a further \u00a315,000 to replace an engine and to increase his company's marketing before the peak summer season, he went back to Funding Circle. \"It's definitely the future; it's where businesses are going to go,\" he said. This type of peer-to-peer funding (P2P) - also known as crowdfunding - turns financing on its head. Instead of asking a bank or a few individuals for large sums of money, a business can ask a large number of people for just a small amount each. The more people who come forward to lend, the lower the interest rate a company can secure. Samir Desai, Funding Circle's chief executive and co-founder, believes speed is the key advantage for SMEs, with businesses getting access to cash within two weeks rather than the three months it typically takes the banks to stump up. \"There is no doubt that technology is now in the middle of changing financial services for good,\" he says. Carol Sullivan, who runs Divorce Negotiator, a firm which aims to help separating couples divide their financial assets, borrowed \u00a315,000 over three years at a rate of 6% from Zopa, the UK's oldest P2P lender for SMEs.  She used the money to fund a TV advertising campaign and says: \"The application process was much simpler and quicker than it would have been with a bank.\"  Open-source data handling systems, such as Hadoop, MongoDB and Cassandra, which can process and structure vast amounts of data from a wide and growing range of sources, including social media, have helped alternative lenders assess borrowers' creditworthiness to a much higher degree of accuracy than before. And this data crunching ability is encouraging new, flexible forms of finance. For example, Kabbage, a fast-growing Atlanta-based company, offers working capital of up to \u00a325,000 to small online businesses selling through eBay and Amazon. It decides how much businesses can have by analysing their social network profiles and user feedback ratings, as much as their commercial transactions. After merchants have been approved for funding - a process Kabbage says can take as little as seven minutes - the cash is deposited in their PayPal accounts, enabling them to buy more inventory and respond quickly to consumer demand. Technology also underpins new \"equity crowdfunding\" platforms, whereby businesses give up a stake in their company in return for investors' cash. For example, Inform Direct, a start-up that aims to make it easier for businesses to deal with Companies House, raised \u00a3450,000 in just two weeks using SyndicateRoom. The platform, which is similar to Crowdcube and Seedrs, offers investment so long as the company seeking capital has secured backing from a lead investor first. And philanthropic funding platforms such as Kickstarter have helped many small businesses and artists bring their projects to fruition. P2P lending may be fast, but it isn't necessarily the cheapest way to raise business capital. Interest rates for the past 100 loans made via Funding Circle's platform ranged from 7.3% to 12.4%, the company says. This is higher than the 4.4% to 7.2% range charged by banks for fixed-rate loans to SMEs, according to the British Bankers Association (BBA). This may be one reason why the UK alternative finance market is still relatively tiny, albeit growing fast. In 2011, it provided \u00a326.7m of finance to SMEs. By last year, that figure had jumped to \u00a3332m, benefiting an estimated 5,000 SMEs, according to research from enterprise charity Nesta.  Poor service from banks is certainly helping this growth.  Last November, government adviser Lawrence Tomlinson issued a damning report on the banks' \"disturbing patterns of behaviour\" towards SMEs. He said many businesses were being \"actively deterred from accessing finance before being given the chance to apply\". But awareness of funding alternatives remains low. A recent survey from the Federation of Small Businesses found that just 37% of SMEs knew about them. And according to the BBA, the UK's main five banks still account for 60% - around \u00a3100bn - of all loans and overdraft borrowing by SMEs. The reliability of the underlying technology is increasing confidence in the sector, however. The UK government allocated \u00a320m in 2013 and a further \u00a340m this year to inject directly into small businesses via Funding Circle, and this month the Financial Conduct Authority began regulating the sector for the first time, giving it an official stamp of approval. And in this year's Budget, Chancellor George Osborne announced that P2P lending will be allowed within tax-free individual savings accounts for the first time.

{"article": "Germany is an enlightened leader in the global battle to reduce CO2 emissions, a pioneer in renewable energy and community power projects and a champion of energy efficiency. Or so the common narrative goes. But try telling that to Monika Schulz-Hopfner. She and her husband, along with 250 other residents of Atterwasch, a quiet village near the Polish border, face eviction from their home of 30 years to make way for the Janschwalde-Nord coal mine.  And not just any old coal, but lignite, the dirtiest form of this ancient fossil fuel that is mined in vast opencast pits. If the plans go ahead, the village, parts of which date back more than 700 years, will be demolished. \"Since the plans for the mine were unveiled in 2007, we have lived with this constant threat, which has taken over the lives of every individual and the community as a whole,\" says Mrs Schulz-Hopfner. \"Every single decision we make is affected by it.\" And the residents of Atterwasch are not alone.  In the eastern German region of Lausitz, nine villages are under threat, where up to 3,000 people could lose their homes to make way for five new lignite mines that are fuelling the country's renewed thirst for coal. Two further mines are under consideration. The mines are needed to power a new generation of coal power plants. Two new lignite plants were opened in 2012, with a further two in the pipeline. Another two hard coal plants also opened last year, with a further five opening this year or next, with two more awaiting licences. The effects are already being felt. Lignite production in 2012 hit its highest level for almost 20 years, while initial estimates suggest this brown coal was used to generate 162bn kWh of electricity last year, more than in any year since 1990. The use of hard coal also increased, meaning the two energy sources accounted for 46% of Germany's overall energy production. The impact on CO2 emissions has been immediate. \"There has been an increase of between 5%-7% in CO2 in the past two years,\" says Prof Claudia Kemfert, head of energy at the German Institute for Economic Research. And this in a country that aims to reduce emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020. As Prof Christian Hey, secretary general of the German Advisory Council for the Environment, says: \"Germany has a coal problem.\" There are many reasons why. One is the low cost of carbon. \"Due to the failure of the emissions trading system, the price of CO2 permits is very low,\" says Prof Hey. \"The EU has failed to address this issue.\" Oversupply and a fall in demand for energy - and therefore permits - during the economic downturn means the price now stands at around three euros per tonne of CO2. If everything had gone to plan, the price would be more than 10 times that by now. Overcapacity has also pushed the price of coal lower, while the lignite industry has benefited to the tune of 60 million euros from being exempt from supporting the renewables industry, says Prof Hey. This means the fossil fuel has moved down what is called the merit order curve. This was introduced in Germany in the 1990s, and determines the order in which energy sources are used to satisfy demand. The cheapest source is used first, the second cheapest second, and so on. Source: World Coal Association, Store Norske Renewables are currently the cheapest, followed by nuclear. Lignite comes next, followed by hard coal. And as the government has resolved to phase out nuclear power by 2022, lignite will move further down the curve. Until the carbon price rises, then, lignite is set to remain at the heart of German energy production.  \"This is one of the biggest inconsistencies of the energy transition, and if the government wanted to address it, it could,\" says Prof Hey. \"To address this paradox, the government needs to adopt a regulatory approach on coal. It is relying on the market, rather than regulation, and this is key to the problem.\" Or as Prof Kemfert puts it: \"The government isn't doing anything.\" In fact, the new coalition has said that all fossil fuel power sources are equally important for the security of supply for the foreseeable future. But despite government inaction, there are some reasons to believe the growing use of lignite may not last.  All the new coal plants built in recent years, together with those that are due to open this year and next, were given the go-ahead about 10 years ago, when energy prices were much higher than now. Some argue that such massive investments are simply not viable in today's economic climate. As Mariana Heinrich at Poyry Managing Consulting says, these plants \"represent the end of a business cycle and not a longer term trend\". More importantly perhaps, \"there is no public or political appetite for building [new coal plants] for the next 30-40 years,\" argues Lars Waldmann, senior associate at the Agora Energiewende think tank. And he says that lignite is not needed to fill the gap that will be left by phasing out nuclear power, a decision taken as far back as 2000. \"We hope and think that gas will fill the gap, as there is enough installed capacity,\" says Mr Waldmann. This capacity is largely dormant right now due to the cheap price of coal, and the rising price of gas. \"From the economic side, renewables and gas can be the cheapest way to cover all demand.\" Mrs Schulz-Hopfner will take little comfort in that. \"It is idiotic. We don't need more and more lignite because we are using more renewable energy,\" she says. \"If we Germans truly want the Energiewende (energy transition), then no more villages should be demolished.\" But the new generation of coal plants means the fossil fuel will remain a key component of Germany's energy mix. The fact that lignite will always be cheap to produce, allied with a powerful pro-coal lobby in German politics, means the temptation to rely on this dirty fuel will remain strong as long as the carbon price remains low. For a country that, in so many respects, is a leader in clean energy, not to mention committed to stringent carbon dioxide emissions reductions, this contradiction seems odd to say the least.

{"article": "Bamboo is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. Sturdy and tenacious, it symbolises virtue. In fact, the plant has had a profound impact on the daily life, culture and spirituality of the Chinese. In the past, a wide variety of products were made from bamboo - from roof tiles and rafts, to shoes, furniture and agricultural tools. But despite the close relationship between Chinese-speaking societies and the natural material, Taiwan's bamboo industry has suffered a decline in recent decades. It nearly collapsed because of people's preference for more modern-looking products, or just cheaper plastic goods - and the impact of less expensive bamboo imports from China and South East Asia. Never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different products\u201d Nowhere was this more apparent than in central Taiwan's Zhushan or \"Bamboo Mountain\" town. Hundreds of families used to make bamboo products there in the centre of the country's bamboo industry. Now there are only about 50. It's a trend reflected in other parts of Taiwan - only about 240 bamboo-products businesses remain on the island. \"In the past, every part of Taiwan had people working in this industry, but over the years, bamboo has been replaced by plastic or steel to make all sorts of products, such as clothes hanging poles, baby cribs, and furniture,\" says Yang Chun-hsien, director of the Forestry Bureau's reforestation and production division. However, an earthquake and strong resolve on the part of the government and industry to continue using bamboo have led to a revival and transformation in its use. In recent years, bamboo has been used to make items never before associated with the plant - from shampoo and insect repellent, to socks, gloves, and even roasted peanuts. This reinvention of how bamboo is used has made it possible for the small family businesses which make up the industry to stay alive and to start reversing the decades of decline. At the height of bamboo production in Taiwan in the 1970s, more than 13 million stalks were harvested each year, and sales of the stalks alone - not including the finished products - amounted to $3.5m (\u00a32.1m) per annum. Plastic is very cheap and can be used for longer,  but what a shame, bamboo is more environmentally friendly\u201d But in the past decade, the annual harvest amounted to only about 1.67 million stalks with sales adding up to just $456,000 - a little over 10% of the peak level. Production and sales, however, have been steadily climbing in recent years.  Following a devastating earthquake on 21 September 1999 centred in Nantou county, where Zhushan lies, the central government decided to help the local economy by commissioning the country's non-profit Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to find new ways to help the bamboo industry grow. ITRI developed a method to carbonise bamboo stalks to produce high quality bamboo charcoal, which has a multitude of different uses. Naturally insulating, the charcoal can be turned into fibres and woven into fabric to make hats, scarves, gloves, socks and pants. Also said to be health giving, it is increasingly added to bodycare products, such as skin creams. Meanwhile, in industry it is used to purify water and air. Yet its most unusual application has to be in the production of bamboo charcoal-coated peanuts - which look exactly as they sound - peanuts covered with charcoal. Many people who have never tasted them are queasy about giving them a try, but they actually taste good, not at all like charcoal, and are believed to have health benefits. Such diversification has bought new hope to Taiwan's bamboo industry. \"When I was growing up, the toys we played with were made of bamboo,\" says Chen Ching-fu, general manager of the Bamboo Culture Park in Zhushan - a manufacturer of bamboo product, and the first visitor attraction in Taiwan devoted to the plant. \"Bamboo was all around us, but never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different types of products.\" Like other businesses, Mr Chen's now sells not only traditional bamboo furniture, but other products such as air fresheners and clothing. Besides bamboo charcoal, the Taiwanese have also found ways to use the actual bamboo to make a much wider variety of products than their ancestors did, including floor panels, pens, clothes hangers and even laptop casings. Sales of goods made from all forms of bamboo in Taiwan now reach $100m, with exports increasing alongside domestic sales. One of the trends helping to drive the revival of the industry is the return of second or third generation young people to help run family businesses. Lin Li-wei, 36, worked at a post office in the capital Taipei after graduating from college. But, making only about $600 a month, he came back to assist his father, who made bamboo ear diggers used by Chinese and Japanese people to remove earwax. He's now put a new spin on the family business - making modern looking clocks, lamps and wall lights out of bamboo. He has been receiving orders for his creations. \"My father supports me trying to innovate,\" says Mr Lin. \"Only through innovations can we add value to our products and continue our business.\" Now he and his father make $5,000 a month. Many of the manufacturers in Zhushan are breaking even, but not making big profits. Still, they persevere, seeing it as their mission to continue to promote the use of bamboo. Bamboo grows fast - just five years to reach maturity, making it one of the most environmentally-friendly plants to use. So growers and industry leaders hope they can replace the use of many types of other wood, and plastic. \"Plastic is very cheap and can be used for a longer time, but what a shame. Bamboo is more environmentally friendly, no chemicals are used to make bamboo products, and the trees grow without the need for fertiliser or pesticides,\" said the Forestry Bureau's Mr Yang. \"Bamboo can also absorb a lot of carbon dioxide and can reduce greenhouse gases.\" Back at the Bamboo Culture Park, Mr Chen has created a do-it-yourself workshop where schoolchildren and other tourists can learn how bamboo charcoal is made and make their own bamboo products. \"Taiwan can't be without bamboo because it's a material we've relied on for generations,\" says Mr Chen. \"I want to help people understand the importance and benefits of using bamboo.\" To hear Cindy Sui's radio version of her look at Taiwan's bamboo industry, check out  ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26891682", "title": ["Why bamboo is booming again in Taiwan"]},

{"article": "It was a revolution moving higher education from bricks to clicks\u2026 and now it's started to go back to bricks again.  Online university providers, which offered people the chance to study from home, are turning full circle by creating a network of learning centres where students can meet and study together. Instead of demolishing the dusty old classrooms, the online university revolution is responsible for opening some new ones. Coursera, a major California-based provider of online courses, is creating an international network of \"learning hubs\", where students can follow these virtual courses in real-life, bricks and mortar settings. And there are thousands of meet-ups in cafes and libraries where students get together to talk about their online courses. This is the latest stage in the rapid evolution of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses - where some of the world's leading universities have created digital versions of courses which are offered free over the internet. Coursera now has seven million registered users. That's bigger than the entire university populations of the UK and France combined. But it seems there is an irresistible social side to learning. Finding stuff out together seems to be more appealing than following a course alone. The Coursera learning hubs are running in more than 30 cities, from Baghdad to Buenos Aires, Moscow to Mumbai and Shanghai to Santiago. The learning hubs are run by partner organisations, providing a place where students following Coursera online courses can come to study together and get help from mentors. In Moscow, the learning hub is hosted by Digital October, a centre for technology and entrepreneurship. Yulia Lesnikova, director of educational programs, says it provides a more sociable way of following online courses. \"Education is a two-way process\u2026 It's a shoulder to lean on,\" she says. Students can work in groups on practical projects together with experts available to give advice. \"Mentors give a lot of help to people who don't understand.\" There have been four online courses so far followed in the Moscow learning hub. This includes a course about genetics created by the University of British Columbia, with students in Moscow being supported by an expert from one of Russia's oldest genetics institutes. There is a course on gamification from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, with sub-titles in Russian. When students are gathered for their Mooc classes it becomes a focus for other spin-offs, such as firms wanting to recruit staff or to get students involved in developing commercial projects. In Beijing, the learning hub has been set up with Guokr, a Chinese science-based social networking website. Yang Liu, Guokr's education director, says studying as a group provides a way of keeping students connected. It's also introduced the word \"Moocer\" into China, she says. \"Learning can be very lonely, they can drop out.\" It can be a more effective way of studying, she says. In a group of people there's likely to be a spread of knowledge, with students able to help one another. \"It's like a village, they form a small society.\" It also allows for different types of learner to be supported. About half of the people following Coursera courses in Beijing are university students, she says. But there are also isolated individuals who like the social setting, such as older people living alone or mothers looking after children at home. Yin Lu, responsible for Coursera's international development, says learning hubs have a wide range of local approaches. They can be based around tutors or around organised projects or else emphasise the social aspect of learning. In India, the focus is on teacher training and professional development. It means that courses designed for students in the US or Europe are being played out in classrooms in New Delhi and Mumbai. What has become apparent, she says, is that there is a much lower drop-out rate for students who attend a learning hub. Moocs allow anyone to enter, with no barriers from cost or qualifications, but that also means relatively few ever finish a course. Ms Lu says that the typical completion rate for a Mooc is about 5% to 10%. For Mooc students attending learning hubs, the completion rates are between 30% and 100%, she says. Ms Lu says it's likely that more hubs will open where there are concentrations of Coursera students. But she says there are no plans for these learning hubs to become fully-fledged colleges, where students might take exams as well as follow courses.  \"We exist to complement what universities can provide,\" she says.  But it wouldn't be difficult to imagine the commercial possibilities if they changed their mind. There is something almost organic about how these digital projects have taken root in the physical world. Moocs were meant to be the university courses of the laptop era, self-sustaining and free-standing, with students able to stop and start materials on the internet and get online support from social networking. But you can't stop people from wanting to talk to each other, outside the computer screen. As well as the more formal learning hubs, self-organised \"meet-ups\" for Coursera students have sprung up in more than 3,700 cities around the world, based around specific Coursera online courses.  For example, in London there are groups meeting in cafes at the British Library and the South Bank Centre. In Paris, there are meetings in the Pompidou Centre and in university buildings. Meet-ups are held in a whole range of public places, where students want to discuss and debate these digital courses.  They're scheduled and arranged online, with the only vital ingredients being a laptop, wi-fi and somewhere to talk. Even virtual students want to have a cup of coffee and a conversation after a lecture.  Will students always want to meet up and talk, even if they are studying online? Will Moocs end up creating their own colleges and universities? If you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on.

It said moves by rivals to compete with its direct delivery service meant its Ofcom-set profit margin may \"never sustainably be achieved\".  It fears rivals will be able to \"cherry pick\" which areas to provide services. Royal Mail called on the Ofcom to review UK delivery services.   However, the communications regulator rejected Royal Mail's call for a review saying it did not believe there was presently a threat to the financial sustainability of the universal postal service.  Royal Mail has put a threat to the universal service obligation on the table today. It says that competitors such as TNT cherry picking lucrative door-to-door delivery routes in cities means the Royal Mail will be left with the less economically viable rural services which it is legally obliged to operate. By 2016, the business suggests it could be costing the Royal Mail \u00a3200m a year by 2016. It will now be complaining to the postal regulator, Ofcom, and demanding \"immediate action\" to protect the service obligation. Ofcom has given its response. \"We would expect Royal Mail to take appropriate steps to respond to the challenge posed by competition, including improving efficiency,\" it said this morning. In plain speak, Ofcom seems to believe there is a lot more Royal Mail can do to save costs before it make a serious point about the threat of the competition. Under Royal Mail's universal service obligation it is required to deliver letters to all parts of the UK six days a week, however its competitors are not currently bound by the same obligation.  Royal Mail fears competitors will be able to provide delivery services to towns and cities, which are considered to be more profitable, and ignore rural areas which cost more to deliver to.  It said the impact of rival TNT Post UK's plans to launch its own letter delivery service could reduce its revenue by more than \u00a3200m by 2017-18.  Royal Mail said if action was not taken there was a reasonable prospect its profit margin target of between 5% and 10%, which is set by Ofcom, \"may never sustainably be achieved\".   Profit margin measures how much a company keeps from sales after its costs are stripped out. The warning came as Royal Mail release its first set of financial results since it was privatised in October.  They showed overall sales rose to \u00a39.46bn in the year to 30 March, up from \u00a39.15bn a year earlier.  Royal Mail's share price fell 7.5%. or 43.10p lower to 531.9p. The group's chief executive Moya Greene said the company's performance was in line with expectations but she admitted it faces a \"couple of headwinds\".  She said: \"The competitive environment on the parcels side is more intense. We are taking steps to remain the leader in this growing market. \"On the letters side, the headwind is direct delivery and we have strategies in place to counter its adverse financial impact.\"  Ofcom is already investigating a complaint from TNT over Royal Mail's decision to change conditions and increase the prices it charges to deliver post collected and pre-sorted by its competitors. Royal Mail believes an investigation into this complaint will lead to a long period of uncertainty around the prices it charges other postal operators. Ms Greene said: \"TNT Post UK can cherry-pick easy-to-serve urban areas, delivering easy-to-handle post to homes less frequently than Royal Mail and to no defined quality standard. \"Royal Mail is required to deliver six days a week, overnight, throughout the whole country, to stringent quality standards and at a uniform, affordable tariff. \"Moreover, we are also required to deliver any items TNT Post UK does not consider economic to deliver itself. If TNT Post UK is successful in delivering its stated objectives, this could threaten the fundamental economics of the universal service.\"  An Ofcom spokesman said: \"Ofcom keeps the market under constant close review, examining the future business plans of major operators. We have a duty to secure the universal service, and if we identify any future threat we have powers to step in to protect it. \"We would expect Royal Mail to take appropriate steps to respond to the challenge posed by competition, including improving efficiency.\" In a statement, TNT Post said: \"Where we do not deliver the mail ourselves, Royal Mail currently charge us a commercial fee which is reflected in Royal Mail's growing profits. \"Competition has created choice and driven innovation and Royal Mail, like its competitors, has no specific quality regulation on its key business mail services.\" Royal Mail's parcel delivery service overtook its letters business to become the biggest contributor to revenue for the first time.  Sales in its parcel delivery business rose 7%, although parcel delivery volumes were flat. Letter delivery volumes fell by 4%. Royal Mail has faced intense competition in its parcel delivery service over the past year as the market has boomed on the back of online shopping.  Its flotation on the London Stock Exchange last Autumn was criticised for selling shares in the company too cheaply, as Royal Mail's shares rocketed as much as 87% above the initial share price of 330p in the first few days after it was listed on the stock market.  On Wednesday, Royal Mail announced plans to trial a Sunday parcel delivery service in response to increasing demand for goods ordered online.  Later this summer it will open about 100 offices on Sunday afternoons for customers to pick up their parcels. Delivery offices with the highest parcel volumes across the UK will take part in the scheme. The company will also try out parcel deliveries to addresses within the M25 motorway on Sundays.

Separate figures showed that public sector borrowing in April rose by nearly 2% to \u00a311.5bn.  The UK's economy remains 0.6% smaller than its peak in early 2008, but analysts now expect this milestone to have been passed when the ONS publishes its estimate of second quarter GDP in July.

{"article": "The Co-operative Group has reported losses of \u00a32.5bn for 2013, the worst results in the organisation's history. The results come shortly after the loss of two directors amid a review into how the group ought to be governed.  Lord Paul Myners quit as a board member following resistance to his plans for reform. His departure followed the exit of chief executive Euan Sutherland who left after less than a year in the job. What exactly does the Co-operative Group do, and how is it run? And will it be possible for it to maintain its spirit and ethics through all the changes? The co-operative movement in the UK began in the north of England in the mid-19th Century. These societies were owned by their members and were usually small retailers which sold a variety of goods.  They came about to sell \"pure\" food at \"full weight and measure\" at a time during the industrial revolution when these things were not guaranteed at shops, according to one of their  . Coming together meant they could combine their buying power and control quality.  The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed in 1863. It has come to be called the Co-operative Group, and is the flagship organisation in the co-operative movement. Gillian Lonergan, head of heritage resources at the Co-operative Heritage Trust, says that in the 19th Century there were as many as 1,000 co-operative societies in Britain. Soon, a division for loans and deposits developed. Founded in 1872, this former part of the group turned into what is now called the Co-operative Bank. Today, the Co-operative Group has food, pharmacy, funeral, electrical, travel and legal businesses. It is the largest \"mutual\" business in the UK, owned by its customers and members who number almost 8 million. The grocer, called Co-operative Food, became the fifth-largest food retail business in the UK after buying Somerfield in 2009. It's the group's biggest business, making more than half of all sales. The Co-operative Group is also the biggest funeral provider and it owns the country's third-largest chain of pharmacies. According to its  , the Co-operative Group runs 4,500 stores, employs more than 90,000 people and has annual sales of more than \u00a313bn. The group lost full ownership of Co-operative Bank after owners of its debt had to bail it out when it uncovered \u00a31.5bn of unexpected losses. Co-op Group now owns about 30% of the lender. The group is owned by its members and 80 or so member societies.  Area committees are the grass roots of the organisation. There are about 48 of them, each with 10 to 12 members who serve three-year, elected terms. These area committee members elect members of the seven regional boards. They, in turn, elect 15 of the 21 members of the group's board. Of the remaining six, five come from member societies, such as Midcounties and Midlands, and there's an independent director, the role held by Lord Myners. There are also boards for the food business; the bank, which the group no longer fully owns; and specialist businesses, which include the pharmacies and funeral care. The group is very keen to point out the advantages of being owned by members and customers, as opposed to being a company owned by shareholders. Critics point to the complexity of how the business is governed and the sheer number of people who have some say in the running of the company. But Co-op say its democratic structure is part of its strength. It means a big organisation can make use of ideas and knowledge relevant to local communities. It can also listen on things like pay. But a   by Lord Myners casts doubt on how well the setup is working in practice. What makes matters more complicated is that while there are no shareholders, the group does issue bonds - loans held not by a bank, but by investors looking for a return.  While bondholders have no say in the running of the company, they can become influential when a company is in trouble. When the Co-op's bank needed rescuing, bondholders swapped their loans for a combined 70% ownership stake in the lender. Following the losses at the lender's bank, the company last year appointed former City minster, Lord Myners, to review the group's governance structure and made him its independent director.  The process has thus far been a painful one. Co-op Group lost its chief executive, Mr Sutherland, when he resigned following the leak of his \u00a33m-a-year pay package to a national newspaper. He told the BBC: \"The senior democrats talk the talk of reform, but in practice they won't do it.\" Lord Myners quit the board amid criticism of his plans to reform the business. His initial review was highly critical of the group's takeovers of Britannia and Somerfield. The first stage of the Myners review accuses the Co-op of suffering from a significant \"democratic deficit\" in which ordinary members have surprisingly weak constitutional rights and a limited ability to influence the group's social mission and activities. The three-tiered governance system of area committees, regional boards and a group board had \"consistently produced governors without the necessary qualifications and experience to provide effective board leadership\", he added.  Lord Myners also said the system meant ordinary members could not directly elect group board members. Midcounties, the largest of the Co-op's independent societies with revenues of \u00a31.2bn and more than 10,000 employees, has publicly opposed the planned reforms. Its president, Patrick Gray,   they would not support the \"menu\" Lord Myners is offering, and that there needed to be negotiation.  \"Among the independent consumer co-operative societies, it is demonstrably the case that it is the most democratic that are the most successful in commercial terms, not the reverse,\" Midcounties said. With  , it's a complex business. Reform in any format is unlikely to be quick. In short, no. The Co-operative Group says it accounts for about 80% of the total Co-operative movement in the UK.  Co-operatives UK, the trade body for societies, estimates the co-operative economy is worth about \u00a336.7bn and has 15.4 million members.

The supermarket giant said it would take away confectionery from near its tills by the end of the year after conducting research into the issue.

We all know how easy it is to be tempted by sugary snacks... we want our customers [to] lead healthier lives\u201d Tesco says its research found about two-thirds of customers questioned said removing confectionery from checkouts would help them make healthier choices.

The latest announcement will affect Tesco Metro and Express stores throughout the UK. Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke said: \"We all know how easy it is to be tempted by sugary snacks at the checkout, and we want to help our customers lead healthier lives. \"We've already removed billions of calories from our soft drinks, sandwiches and ready meal ranges... and we will continue to look for opportunities to take out more.\" Ms Ellison said Tesco was responding to the \"clear demands\" of customers for healthy checkouts.  \"This initiative will help people to make healthier choices, which all contributes to reducing the long-term cost to our nation of obesity and ill-health,\" she said.

{"article": "The US Federal Reserve has begun discussions on how it will raise short-term interest rates, minutes from the central bank's April meeting reveal. The Fed has kept its target rate at 0% since 2008, when it slashed rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and combat the recession. However, members cautioned   that a discussion did not signal a rate rise was imminent. Most observers expect a rate rise in the latter half of 2015. \"The committee's discussion of this topic was undertaken as part of prudent planning and did not imply that normalization would necessarily begin sometime soon,\" the minutes said. US stock markets seemed to accept those assurances, with all three indexes rising in the wake of the release. The Fed has been in the process of removing some of the stimulus efforts put in place to help support the US economy in the wake of the financial crisis and subsequent recession in 2008 and 2009. This pull-back has focused on reducing the bank's monthly bond buying purchases, known as quantitative easing, which were undertaken in an effort to keep long-term interest rates low and encourage spending. The Fed began \"tapering\", or trimming, these purchases, in January (although it announced the move in December). In April, the Fed announced it had cut its purchases to $45bn a month, from a high of $85bn. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen has said that the central bank believes the US economy is growing, and that growth is set to pick up in the latter half of this year. According to the minutes, Fed members felt that \"recent indicators pointed to a rebound and suggested that the economy had returned to a trajectory of moderate growth\". Nonetheless, the members of the committee also had concerns, noting that while the unemployment rate was falling rapidly, other measures indicated that the labour market was still shaky.  The employment situation is just one reason why the central bank has said it does not yet think the US economy is stable enough to exist without some support. The minutes were released on the same day that Ms Yellen addressed the graduating class of New York University, which also granted her an honorary degree. Ms Yellen  : \"Finding the right path in life, more often than not, involves some missteps.  \"My Federal Reserve colleagues and I experienced this as we struggled to address a financial and economic crisis that threatened the global economy.\" She also praised her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, for his \"grit\" in the face of the tough decisions that were made during the financial crisis. That emphasis on grit seemed to resonate with many of the young graduates in attendance, most of whom said they had not yet found jobs. It's getting better but things are still really scary for new graduates\u201d Chelien Brown is graduating from NYU's College of Arts and Sciences. He says that while he has not yet found a job, he is feeling optimistic. \"Most of the people who I know who graduated in 2009 seemed to have a harder time finding jobs than I have,\" he said. \"I've had an easier time getting interviews - I've gotten further down the line a little faster than they did.\" While most students the BBC spoke to agreed that they were better off than those who graduated while Ms Yellen's predecessor was in charge, they also said that the recession and its aftermath have left their mark. \"It's getting better but things are still really scary for new graduates,\" says Ilana Sufrin, who says that both her and her twin sister have yet to find work. \"I wouldn't say I'm optimistic, but I'm trying to be realistic about it,\" she said. \"People do need to work - we're going to need to do something about it.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27512643", "title": ["Federal Reserve weighs options for interest rate rise"]},

The site of the planned protest was changed after McDonald's vacated its headquarters in the US state of Illinois after consulting with police.

The closure affected one of five McDonald's corporate buildings and about 3,000 employees. Protesters - which included a few hundred McDonald's workers - said they were seeking to highlight how low wages have exacerbated income inequality in the US. The protest was planned before the annual shareholder meeting, where a vote is expected on executive pay. Last year, chief executive Don Thompson was paid $9.5m.

Fast-food workers and labour organisers have been protesting since 2012 in an effort to boost wages and win worker rights, such as paid sick leave.  Last week, they organised a global walk out in more than 250 cities to highlight what they say are the difficulties facing low-paid restaurant employees. US President Barack Obama has pushed Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from $7.25, however he has faced stiff opposition from Republicans.

{"article": "Russia's President Vladimir Putin has signed a multi-billion dollar, 30-year gas deal with China. The deal between Russia's Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has been 10 years in the making.  Russia has been keen to find an alternative energy market for its gas as it faces the possibility of European sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine. No official price has been given but it is estimated to be worth over $400bn. President Putin said in a statement to the Russian news  channel Rossiya: \"The price is satisfactory for both sides.  \"It is tied, like  it is envisaged in all our international contracts with  Western partners, specifically our partners in Western  Europe, to the market price on oil and oil products. It is an absolutely calibrated, general formula for pricing.\"  Gazprom shares rose 2% on the news.  Media requires JavaScript to play. How significant is the deal? The agreement, signed at a summit in Shanghai, is expected to deliver some 38 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year eastward to China's burgeoning economy, starting around 2018. The main argument has been over price and China is thought to have been driving a hard bargain.  Over the last 10 years it has found other gas suppliers. Turkmenistan is now China's largest foreign gas supplier, and last year it started importing piped natural gas from Myanmar. Alexei Miller, Chief Executive of Gazprom said the new deal was \"the biggest contract in the entire history of the USSR and Gazprom - over 1 trillion cubic metres of gas will be supplied during a whole contractual period.\" Rain Newton-Smith, head of emerging markets at Oxford Economics, said: \"The whole tenet of the deal has a symbolic value - it says that the two countries are prepared to work with one another. For instance there were other elements such as Chinese participation in Russian transport infrastructure and power generation. \"It is similar in many ways to China's investments in Africa where they drive a hard bargain over the price of raw materials but then provide infrastructure for the economies they are doing business with. Jonathan Marcus, the BBC's defence and diplomatic correspondent said tensions between Russia and the west were not just over Ukraine: \"There are fundamental differences over Syria and about the whole direction in which President Vladimir Putin is taking his country.  \"Thus this deal could symbolise an important  moment of transition - when both in economic and geo-political terms, Russia's gaze begins to look more towards the East than towards the West.\"  Another sticking point on the deal has been the construction of  pipelines into China. Currently there is one complete pipeline that runs across Russia's Far East to the Chinese border, called The Power of Siberia. It was started in 2007, three years after Gazprom and CNPC signed their initial agreement in 2004. But financing the $22-30bn cost of sending it into China has been central to the latest discussions. China is Russia's largest single trading partner, with bilateral trade flows of $90bn (\u00a353bn) in 2013. The two neighbours aim to double the volume to $200bn in 10 years.

{"article": "UK mortgage lending in April was 36% higher than a year ago, a lenders' group says, as a major bank moves to cool the housing market in London. Gross lending was up 8% compared with March to an estimated total of \u00a316.6bn, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML). The figures come shortly after Lloyds Banking Group said it would limit lending for higher-value homes. The data includes the first week of implementation of new mortgage rules. The regulations, introduced by the City watchdog - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), came into force fully on 26 April but some lenders were already applying the new rules. They ensure that lenders conduct a full affordability check on mortgage applicants. The extra time required for lending assessments was expected to slow down the mortgage market, and there have been falls in the number of mortgage approvals in recent months. Although total lending rebounded April, to the highest level for any April since 2008, the CML said it was too early to be accurate about the effect the new rules would have. \"The implementation of the Mortgage Market Review [rules] from late April has made it a little harder to interpret recent data. As we have pointed out previously, there may be some disruption to the monthly pattern of activity while MMR procedures bed down,\" said CML chief economist Bob Pannell. The latest CML data records mortgages that have actually been advanced, rather than just approved. The effect on those applying when the new rules are in full flow will not be seen in these figures for a few months.  Total mortgage lending remains well below pre-crisis levels. The number of homes sold per month are also well below the pre-crisis peak. In April, 94,960 homes were sold in the UK,  . This was up from 72,180 in April 2013, but much lower than the 126,450 homes sold in April 2007. However, various consumer groups, politicians and commentators have called for the housing market to be cooled. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics showed an annual house price rise in the UK of 8%, including a 17% rise in London. On Tuesday, Lloyds Banking Group said it would limit mortgage lending to four times income for loans worth more than \u00a3500,000, in order to address \"specific inflationary pressures in the London housing market\". The average property price in London is \u00a3459,000, according to the   from the Office for National Statistics. The move, primarily for new borrowers but also to those taking out additional borrowing or those remortgaging to move, applies to lending through Halifax, Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows Bank. Source: ONS, March 2014 The question now is whether this will be matched by other lenders, or give others the chance to make a land grab for this custom. Lloyds expects the policy change to affect around 8% of its lending in London.  Ray Boulger, of mortgage broker John Charcol, said the move may well pressure other lenders to follow suit. As yet, none have done so. HSBC and Santander said that affordability, rather than income multiples, was the deciding factor when making a decision. TSB, run separately from the Lloyds stable, said it was not considering following Lloyds' move at this stage. Barclays also said that affordability was the \"most important factor\". \"On income multiples, Barclays will lend up to 5.5 times income in certain scenarios but this will depend on a number of factors such as level of deposit, income levels and the amount of debt a customer might have,\" a Barclays spokesman said. Aaron Strutt, of Trinity Financial mortgage brokers, said: \"Lloyds is such a huge lender that there will be a void to fill, particularly as they have been keen to offer bigger mortgages for quite some time. Some of the other banks will see this as an opportunity to lend more money.\" He said many lenders were offering mortgages over \u00a3500,000 and, providing the borrower met affordability criteria, they would offer up to five times income. The CML is expecting the Bank of England to step in soon and change the territory for all lenders. \"The Bank of England has signalled that macro-prudential measures to limit the housing market upturn are likely in the near future, and possibly in the very near future,\" Mr Pannell said. \"Forthcoming measures will, in our estimation, be careful, calibrated, and proportionate, and designed to reinforce prudent affordability checks, rather than to apply the brakes to the housing market in a more dramatic fashion.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27499641", "title": ["Mortgage lending leap fuels housing market debate"]},

On Monday, a court re-affirmed the oil giant must pay some businesses economic damages whether or not they can prove the spill caused losses.  The ruling was seen as a blow to BP's attempt to limit the costs of settling claims. BP initially estimated it would pay $7.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in business claims. The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig, off the coast of Louisiana, killed 11 workers and caused the worst offshore oil spill in US history.  In the wake of that disaster, BP reached the terms of a settlement to compensate businesses.  But the oil company has argued that the terms are being misinterpreted and that it would face paying compensation for false claims. \"No company would agree to pay for losses that it did not cause, and BP certainly did not when it entered into this settlement,\" BP said in a statement. BP has previously said that unwarranted claims include a company that had a fire unconnected to the oil spill, and another business that closed before the disaster. However, in Monday's ruling, a judge said BP knew the terms of the settlement to which it had agreed.

Tiffany, which is known for its turquoise gift boxes, also boosted its earnings outlook for 2014.  The company  has been struggling for the past two years to find the right balance between the expensive jewellery, for which it is better known, and cheaper silver items that generate a quarter of sales. Tiffany chief executive Michael Kowalski said: \"This is an excellent and encouraging start to the year.\"  He also said that strength in fine and statement jewellery sales continued, while sales of Tiffany's new or expanded jewellery collections accelerated, led by its Atlas collection. The Atlas Collection is a new range that focuses on silver jewellery - including lariats, rings and pendants - priced below $500.

{"article": "A third of students in England, who pay up to \u00a39,000 in tuition fees, say their degree course is poor or very poor value for money, a study indicates.   A survey of 15,046 UK students found they have just 10 minutes extra with university lecturers despite the rise - for the majority - in fees since 2012. The findings are revealed by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and the Higher Education Academy (HEA). The government said students, \"quite rightly\", had higher expectations. Higher tuition fees in England mean undergraduates currently in the first or second year of university study are paying up to \u00a39,000 a year. The Hepi and HEA research found today's students in England  were more likely to say their course was poor value compared to 2012 - before the fee hike. One third of current first- and second-year students (33%) said they were receiving poor or very poor value for money, compared with 18% in 2012. And just 36% of these students thought their course represented good value for money, compared with 52% in 2012.   But the study found  students in Scotland were more likely to say their course was worth the money, with  70% of those at Scottish universities rating their course as good or very value. However, Scottish students pay no tuition fees, if they study at a university in Scotland.  The Hepi/HEA report says regional differences in perceptions of value for money are \"not unexpected given that Scottish and other EU-domiciled students from outside the UK, who constitute the vast majority of students at Scottish institutions, effectively pay no fees\". When asked what their top three priorities would be for institutional expenditure, 48% of UK students polled said \"reducing fee levels\", followed by having more teaching hours and reducing the size of teaching groups (both 35%). The survey also found 31% said they would definitely or maybe have chosen another course if they were to have their time again. The survey found that in the first and second years of their degree, undergraduates have an average of 14.2 hours of \"contact\" time - for example time spent in lectures and seminars, and spend another 14.3 hours on average in private study. This is much less than the 40 hours a week of study suggested in the Quality Assurance Agency's (QAA) guidelines, the report said. The findings show students do not attend about 9% of lectures and seminars laid on by their university, with the most common reasons for absence  being that undergraduates did not find the lectures very useful and that the notes were available online. Universities minister David Willetts said: \"Young people are more serious about their education than ever before. Universities need to raise their game [...] I don't think universities are worse, but students have higher expectations, quite rightly.\" Mr Willetts  said institutions would now have to do \"far better\" than simply offering lectures with 500 students sitting in a room taking notes from slides on a screen. He added: \"The days where the academic experience is simply sitting in rows with 500 other people taking notes from slides on a screen that you can access online on your laptop, universities now have to do far better than that.\" Nick Hillman, director of Hepi, said: \"The data suggest growing differences across the UK. Students in Scotland generally think they are getting good value for money.  \"Meanwhile, students in England are paying much more but receiving only a little more. In England, one in three students say they are getting poor value for money - nearly twice as high as before the \u00a39,000 fees were introduced. \"In this election year, students should press all the political parties to say what they will do to encourage universities to offer world-class teaching alongside their world-class research.\" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \"The increase in fees in England and the shift away from public funding to higher graduate contributions means that students are clearly demanding more from their courses.  \"The important thing is ensuring that students have enough information about their courses and that the experience matches their expectations. \"Due to the quality of its degrees, the UK has one the strongest and most highly respected higher education systems in the world.\" Sonia Sodha, head of public services policy at the consumer magazine Which?, said: \"A key problem is a lack of information that makes it difficult for students to make a fully informed choice. We want better data to be included in the key information set such as the amount and type of scheduled teaching.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27486606", "title": ["Degree courses 'not value for money', say many students"]},
{"article": "The Scottish referendum is the \"foremost issue for businesses\" in the UK, the head of the business lobby group, the CBI, will say later. In a speech this evening, Sir Mike Rake will say that the case has not been made that an independent Scotland would be better for the economy. \"It is difficult to see how independence would be better for investment and jobs,\" he will say. He is also set to highlight the importance of the European elections. Sir Mike will tell the CBI annual dinner that while the decision on independence is for the Scottish people to take, the CBI would continue to raise economic questions on the issue. \"The CBI has the right and duty to ask the difficult questions about issues which affect our members' interests and this country's economic future,\" he is expected to say. Sir Mike Rake's comments have renewed the debate about the CBI's role in the referendum. The business group registered with the Electoral Commission as a formal \"No\" campaigner only to nullify that registration saying it had been a mistake. But every time a senior CBI figure airs concerns about the impact of Scottish independence, supporters of a \"Yes\" vote cry foul, insisting that the organisation should re-register; that its professed neutrality is a fig leaf. They are also angry about the BBC's continued membership of the CBI, which has now been transferred to the broadcaster's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, saying it threatens impartial reporting. They point out that fellow broadcaster STV has resigned from the CBI. Opponents of independence say this is the latest example of Yes Scotland and its supporters focusing on process rather than substance. They say the debate should focus on the issues: currency, European Union membership and trade. And here, of course, there is no agreement. Campaigners for independence say Scotland has a unique opportunity to build a more prosperous and just society; opponents say business is better off with the size, security and stability of the United Kingdom. \"The effects of the decision will be felt by others, including businesses - not just in Scotland but in Wales, Northern Ireland and England,\" he will add. However, his comments were dismissed by Business for Scotland, a group supporting a Yes vote in the Scottish referendum. The group said that \"more and more businesses here see the opportunities that independence offers them\".  \"They see that Scotland's economy will thrive in the hands of a Scottish Government that understands its needs,\" it added.  The CBI had originally registered as a campaigner against Scottish independence, but the application was later nullified by the Electoral Commission. Most of Scotland's universities, several quangos, the Law Society of Scotland and two businesses - Aquamarine Power and Balhousie Care Group - left the organisation as a result of the initial decision to campaign for a \"No\" vote. Sir Mike will also argue that the second major risk for business is Britain's place in the EU. \"Open markets are an essential part of our open economy,\" he will say. \"We cannot be our best when in isolation.\" On the question of a referendum on EU membership he will say that even the possibility of having it has caused uncertainty in business and that while membership has its frustrations, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.

The sports presenter invested thousands into Icebreaker, a company which purported to support young musicians. However, a recent court ruling said the firm was \"understood by all concerned to be a tax avoidance scheme\". Logan says she invested in the scheme in \"good faith\" and vowed \"to pay any tax\" she owes. She added that she pulled out of the scheme in 2012. \"I have been completely open and honest with HMRC and I have never hidden anything\u201d Logan issued the following statement  , following press speculation about her involvement in the scheme. \"I was advised about a business opportunity six years ago (2008) and I invested in good faith.  \"It was explained to me as a way of funding new acts in the music industry. Because of information which came to light in 2012, I decided the investment was not right for me.  \"With new professional help and advisors, I have for some time been working to resolve the issue and I fully intend to pay any tax which should have been paid, had I not entered the business. The presenter said she had been \"completely open and honest\" with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), adding: \"I have never hidden anything.\" Take That singer Gary Barlow - along with band-mates Howard Donald and Mark Owen, and manager Jonathan Wild - were among about 1,000 people who put money into the Icebreaker scheme. Since March 2010, the four men have been directors of Larkdale LLP - one of 50 partnerships that Icebreaker arranged to harness tax reliefs that the government had intended would support those in creative industries. The tribunal found that shortly after money was put in to Larkdale LLP, it reported huge losses of more than \u00a325m. Those losses could then be offset against tax, reducing the men's tax bills. In total, around 50 partnerships with hundreds of members invested in Icebreaker, which claimed total losses of \u00a3336m. Last week, former Olympic hurdler and BBC broadcaster Colin Jackson admitted to being in one such partnership, Sparkdale LLP, along with a number of dentists and lawyers. He defended his decision to invest in the loss-making scheme,   he was proud to have supported struggling musicians.  \"If it means you have to take a hit then I'll happily take a hit,\" he said. \"People have invested in me in the past to help me get to the top of my game. I'll still invest in people to help them get to the top of their game.\" HMRC pursued Icebreaker through the courts after the Times newspaper first exposed the scheme in 2012.

{"article": "Ed Miliband says a Labour government would set a statutory minimum wage target linked to average earnings, as he set out plans to tackle low pay. The party will announce an exact figure - covering the years 2015 to 2020 - nearer the general election. Mr Miliband said it was a \"scandal\" that there were five million people in work who \"can't make ends meet\". Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have already said they want a rise in the minimum wage.  Media requires JavaScript to play. However any major increase is likely to be criticised by business groups worried that it would drive up costs and damage competitiveness. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said Downing Street believed that as a result of economic growth there could be a real terms increase in the level of the minimum wage, but that it should remain a matter for the Low Pay Commission to recommend its level. Mr Miliband said there would always be voices against change, but insisted it was \"time to raise our sights\" on tackling low pay. He said Britain's future lay in higher productivity, skills and wages. The Labour leader today unveiled a report by Alan Buckle, the former deputy chairman of KPMG International, which details proposals to overhaul the Low Pay Commission. The Buckle report sets out a new framework for the commission with a five-year target to increase the minimum wage, and a strengthened role in tackling poverty and raising productivity. It calls for greater powers for HMRC and local councils to tackle the 300,000 people illegally not paid the national minimum wage, and for the government to take the lead in becoming a \"living wage\" employer. Mr Buckle said a clear, long-term goal to increase the minimum wage over the lifetime of a parliament was achievable and would be good for citizens, business and government. In a speech to party activists in the West Midlands at the launch of the report, Mr Miliband said it was a \"basic right\" that hard work should be rewarded with fair pay. He said Labour's plan would restore \"the basic bargain linking hard work to economic security\". Labour will not say what the final level for the minimum wage would be, but a source said it would be a \"stretching target\". Addressing party activists, Mr Miliband said: \"This is the generational question, and it goes beyond party, it goes beyond one government, it goes much deeper than that. \"It is about who we are as a country, who we recover to be.\" Mr Miliband said: \"It is time to write the next chapter in the battle with low pay. And that is what our economy demands, because work doesn't pay for enough people.\" He added: \"The minimum wage will rise by more than average earnings in the economy as a whole as part of a five-year ambition to restore the link between doing a hard day's work and building a decent life for your family.\" Earlier, Mr Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This gets at what is a terrible scandal in this country, which is that we have still five million people in paid work unable to make ends meet... \"We've got to go further in tackling the problem of low pay.\" Mr Miliband said he wanted the minimum wage to rise in proportion to average earnings during the next parliament. He emphasised that he was setting out a \"framework\" rather than an exact figure, and that Labour would consult businesses. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable has also proposed setting a long-term target and Chancellor George Osborne has called for the minimum wage to rise to \u00a37 an hour. The minimum wage will increase by 19p an hour to \u00a36.50 from October. Katja Hall, chief policy director of the CBI business group, told Today: \"I think we need to recognise that the system we have at the moment has been really successful and that system involves the setting of the minimum wage by an independent Low Pay Commission. \"They have done a really good job and we think it's much better the job is left to them rather than given to politicians.\" Mr Miliband said the European Parliament election this week was \"very unpredictable\" and that the recent increase in support for the UK Independence Party was due to \"discontent with the system\". It was up to Labour to show voters that the country \"can be better\" in the run-up to next year's general election, he added. BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that if, after four years of austerity, Mr Miliband did not win what is a national election, he would \"have some questions to answer\".

The firm said it had been boosted by a strong performance in its electricity transmission operations. But the results come during what it said was a \"very challenging\" time for the energy sector. In March SSE said it was freezing its energy tariffs until January 2016. The UK's Big Six energy suppliers, which control around 95% of the retail market, have come under fire in recent years for steadily increasing tariffs. SSE also said it had lost 370,000 customers over the course of the year but it said most of the decline in customer accounts came before it announced its two year price freeze. It said increased switching between suppliers by customers during the year had meant the number of electricity and gas customer accounts in Great Britain and the Ireland had fallen from 9.47 million to 9.10 million.    Meanwhile, SSE's operating profits from its retail operations fell by 28.6% to \u00a3292m. The energy supplier's share price rose 0.26% in early trading on the London Stock Exchange to 1572p.\t SSE Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the results were a \"mixed bag\", given the near fall in profits in the retail division.  He added that the company's commitment to freeze energy tariffs until 2016 would reduce profits by \u00a3100m. Mr Phillips-Davies said SSE faced intense competition in the market from smaller suppliers. He added: \"I think there is a lot SSE can offer, but people have switched.  [However] I think we have lots of customers satisfied because they are staying with us.\" SSE also reported a one-off charge of \u00a3747.2m as a result of scaling back its offshore wind projects, as well as the disposal of what it called \"non-core\" businesses which include street lighting contracts.

{"article": "Thousands of letters are to be sent to single parents in Britain informing them of changes to their child maintenance arrangements. The government wants parents to agree their child maintenance agreements \"amicably\" or face a charge. It said the changes were necessary as the old set-up was costly for taxpayers. But a charity said the changes could force some parents into \"unstable\" arrangements. Child maintenance is financial support that helps towards a child's living costs when its parents have separated. If parents split, maintenance should be paid to the person who takes care of the child on a day-to-day basis. Under the old system many single parents used the Child Support Agency (CSA) to sort out maintenance payments, but ministers  . A government spokesman said the old CSA was using an IT system that was \"totally inadequate and notoriously riddled with defects\", and as such it was costing \u00a374 million per annum to run in operating costs alone. The spokesman added that the old maintenance system \"took responsibility away from parents, encouraging conflict and hostility at huge expense to the taxpayer\". In an effort to improve the situation the new replacement \"Child Maintenance Service\" has been gradually rolled out, which the government said is designed to act as a backstop for parents having trouble. This week more than 50,000 letters are being sent out by the Department for Work and Pensions to parents in England, Scotland and Wales who currently pay and receive child maintenance through the old CSA.  Ministers want to encourage people to come to voluntary arrangements but if that is not possible - and the new statutory service is used - then both parties will be charged.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Under the new rules if an amicable arrangement cannot be reached the paying parent - usually the father - will have a 20% fee added to the maintenance payment, while the receiving parent will pay 4% to get the money. The charges will be introduced later this year, and all single parents will be charged an upfront fee of \u00a320 for registering with the new service. However, the chief executive of the single-parent charity Gingerbread, Fiona Weir, said she was \"concerned\" by the reforms. She said: \"While many parents are able to agree private child maintenance arrangements, for many other parents, this just isn't possible without government help.  \"We're very concerned that closing CSA cases and bringing in charges may deter some parents from making new child maintenance agreements or pressure single parents into unstable arrangements, and children will lose out on vital support.\" For further help and assistance with child maintenance parents can visit  .

The   also said retail sales jumped by 1.3% between March and April beating analysts forecasts for a 0.5% rise. Food sales during the late Easter holiday made a significant contribution to the overall figure, the ONS said. They were 6.3% higher in April against a year earlier, and 3.6% up on March.  Non-food sales rose by 6.5% compared with a year earlier, but were down 0.4% on the month.  The annual rise in food sales was the biggest since January 2002, and were helped by a combination of better weather and sales promotions. Increases in the price of food were limited to 0.9% in April, compared with 1.8% a month earlier.   Quarterly retail sales have now grown for 14 months in a row, the ONS added. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, described the latest set of figures as \"mightily impressive\", adding \"this bodes very well for GDP growth in the second quarter\". He said: \"The fundamentals for consumers are currently improving overall, and they should continue to do so over the coming months as employment rises further and earnings growth likely trends higher than inflation, thereby lifting purchasing power. \"The strong housing market is also supportive to retail sales.\"  And Ian Geddes, UK head of retail at Deloitte, said: \"It is encouraging to finally see some strong figures in the food sector, as this remains a challenging market for the large grocers who are vigorously responding to consumers' changing retail habits and, are currently implementing significant structural reorganisation.  \"This is clearly a long race and the large grocers are repositioning themselves to win over customers in the new, more complex era of multichannel retailing.\" The retail figures come a day after official figures showed inflation increased to 1.8% in April, up from a four year low of 1.6% in March.

The annual increase slowed compared with a 9.2% year-on-year price rise to the end of February. However, the latest official data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that the annual property price increase in London stood at 17%. Excluding London and the South East of England, prices were up by 4.7%.  The wide range of activity was shown with prices in Northern Ireland increasing by 0.3% on a year-on-year basis, and by 0.8% in Scotland. In the East of England, property prices were up by 6.6% annually, and by 6.1% in the South East of England. The ONS said that prices fell by 0.5% in March compared with February, matching other surveys, making the average home worth \u00a3252,000. This was the first month-on-month drop for over a year. However, house price data from the Halifax and Nationwide, based on their lending, have also shown fairly sharp rises in prices on average over the last year, despite the regional differences. This has prompted some commentators to call for the second phase of the government-backed Help to Buy scheme in the UK - which supports new homebuyers who might have struggled to get a mortgage - to be scaled back. Prime Minister David Cameron told the BBC: \"Of course, we will consider any changes that are proposed by [Bank of England governor] Mark Carney. An unaddressed bubble in London will pump up bubbles in adjacent regions, as buyers feel compelled to look for value and affordability elsewhere\u201d \"But, as he said, this is a well-targeted scheme and it has helped tens of thousands of people get on the housing ladder and to have mortgages.\" The shadow chancellor, Ed  Balls, said the Help to Buy scheme was simply too high: \"We've said it should come down much closer to average house prices. A number below \u00a3400,000 would make much more sense than \u00a3600,000 which is far too big a house price for the taxpayer to be guaranteeing mortgages. \" The Treasury minister - Andrea Leadsom - said there were a number of issues for the government to consider: \"The thing is it's a fine balance. In London prices are rising quite fast. In the rest of the country - and in the country as a whole - they remain 15% in real terms below their pre-crisis peak. \" Mr Carney said he was watching the housing market closely. Although there was a shortage of homes, which the Bank could do nothing about, it did have influence on lenders and would tell the chancellor if changes needed to be made to the government's housing market schemes.  Mortgage rules have been altered recently, that is thought to be lengthening the time it takes to get a home loan. This has reduced the number of mortgage approvals in recent weeks.  The Bank of England also has the power to control interest rates, and a separate report suggests a rise in the Bank rate could hit hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders hard. The Resolution Foundation estimates that 770,000 vulnerable households could be \"imprisoned\" by a limited ability to switch to another mortgage deal were interest rates to rise. That represents about one in 10 mortgage holders in the UK. The Bank rate is at a record low of 0.5%, but analysts are predicting a rise in the rate at some point in 2015. \"Many borrowers have enjoyed spectacular savings over recent years, with mortgage rates falling to historic lows, and most will be able to ride the tide of gradually rising interest rates,\" said Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation and author of the report. \"But for around one in four, even modest rate rises could create financial difficulties. Those at greatest risk are members of this group who also find themselves unable to access the best deals in the market today.  \"Almost one in 10 households are doubly exposed: facing the prospect of their mortgage becoming increasingly unaffordable in the future and with the market offering them limited, if any, choice today.\" The report suggested that homeowners in London and eastern England were most exposed to an interest rate rise. The cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, rose to 1.8% in April from 1.6% in March. This was the first rise in inflation for 10 months and pushed the annual change in prices slightly higher than the annual change in average earnings. Alternatively, you can use the form below.

{"article": "The first thing Sophia Amoruso - chief executive of Nasty Gal, the fastest growing e-commerce site in the US - sold on the internet was something she had stolen. A misfit who grew up hating school, Ms Amoruso left home at 17, intent on a life of anarchy and getting by for free in Olympia, Washington. She says she received a rude wake-up call one day when she was caught shoplifting (but let off), which she had been doing in order to support her lifestyle. \"I learned the hard way that taking shortcuts and living for free is not really living free,\" she says. Now 30, Ms Amoruso says that her early mistakes were crucial in helping her build Nasty Gal from a simple eBay store selling vintage items in 2006 to a $100m (\u00a360m) business with more than 350 employees selling cool, quirky new and used clothing items to millions of women around the world. \"It was like throwing myself at the wall the way you throw spaghetti - to see if it sticks,\" she says. It goes without saying that Ms Amoruso is not your typical entrepreneur, and certainly not cut from the same cloth as the legions of technology bosses who flock to Silicon Valley in search of funding and riches. After the shoplifting incident in 2003, Ms Amoruso moved to San Francisco, California.  Every other fashion brand out there - including those that I call competitors - are run by mostly old white men, and the customer knows it\u201d A community college drop-out, she developed a hernia and so started work as a security guard checking IDs at an art school - a job she took for the health insurance it provided.  Bored, she decided to open an eBay store re-selling vintage clothing after reading a book called Starting an eBay Business for Dummies. She named her eBay store Nasty Gal Vintage, after a song and album by the jazz singer Betty Davis, second wife of the legendary Miles Davis. In her memoir, #GIRLBOSS, she says eBay was a crucial platform because she learned to respond to every customer comment, to really understand who was buying her finds and what they wanted.  That helped her beat other vintage sellers because she knew how to style the pieces she found - using young models who were paid a salary of burgers at a local restaurant - to appeal to her demographic.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Nasty Gal's Sophia Amoruso speaks to the BBC's Samira Hussain After a spat with rival sellers ended with her getting kicked off the auction platform, she struck out on her own, buying the domain name NastyGalVintage.com (NastyGal.com was initially owned by a porn firm) and communicating with her customers through social media sites such as MySpace and eventually Facebook and Twitter. \"Using social media allowed me to have a conversation with our customers - I would say it was the number one reason we created awareness,\" she adds. That put Ms Amoruso ahead of competitors who were just realising the power of social media to drive business. \"Every other fashion brand out there - including those that I call competitors - are run by mostly old white men, and the customer knows it,\" she says. \"This generation is super savvy - it doesn't matter who you hire to run your social media if the person behind the scenes pulling the strings is far from the customer.\" Ms Amoruso says Nasty Gal amassed its 1.2 million Instagram followers and millions of Facebook likes by aggressively styling the firm's clothing in unique looks that \"you can't find at the mall\".  She pioneered the idea of styling outfits from head to toe and mixing old and new, expensive and cheap and made sure that Nasty Gal wasn't just a retail website, but a lifestyle that could appeal to a certain type of woman. That has helped to build loyalty - most customers are women in their 20s who return again and again to the site, buying up 93% of Nasty Gal's inventory at full price. Half of the site's business comes from return customers - something almost unheard of in retail circles. Even after Nasty Gal started taking off - moving from a tiny office to a large space in Los Angeles - Ms Amoruso initially resisted taking outside investment, a rarity among tech firms, most of which aren't profitable in their early years. \"I had the luxury of a profitable business,\" she says. That allowed her to wait for the right investor - which took some time. \"When I decided to raise money, every guy was on to the fact that women like to shop as if it was the newest thing.

{"article": "MSPs are to examine claims that contracts given to youth football players in Scotland are unfair and could breach human rights regulations. The authors of a petition to the Scottish Parliament say players under the age of 16 are not allowed to change club without compensation being paid. They argue this \"transfer market\" breaches Scots law and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The issue will be discussed at the  . Among those scheduled to take part is Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster. He will be joined by Andrew McKinlay of the Scottish Football Association, Heart of Midlothian's director of football John Murray, and lawyer Malcolm McGregor. The   petition was lodged at the parliament four years ago by William Smith and Scott Robertson of the Real Grassroots campaign. The pair have been involved in boys club football for many years, and have been credited with helping to discover and develop some of the country's best young players. The Scottish government should seriously consider suspending funding (direct or indirect) to clubs pending an independent review\u201d Their petition states that one-year registration forms given by professional clubs to 15-year-olds are in effect contracts, which restricts the ability of the player to change club for the following three years. Mr Smith and Mr Robertson have argued that this breaches the Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991 and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. They have also claimed that clubs were sometimes paying more than the stipulated compensation amounts set out by the football authorities to sign young players from another club. This effectively creates a transfer market in child footballers, they have alleged. The claim was backed at a previous meeting of the petitions committee by Rangers youth coach Jim Sinclair, who said: \"In our experience, the whole thing can turn into a transfer market or end up in a bartering situation if, despite the fact that the level of compensation is actually X, the club with the player demands X plus Y.\" He described the practice as \"reprehensible\". Mr Smith and Mr Robertson have said the current system was having an \"adverse effect\" on young players, and have called for it to be abolished. But they have claimed that there is \"no appetite\" for the football authorities to address breaches of the rules committed by their member clubs. Among the proposals they have made are: In a letter to the committee ahead of the meeting, Mr Smith and Mr Robertson said: \"Every year a significant amount of public money is provided to Scotland's professional clubs and it is given in the spirit and hope that this money will be used to better our national game for youngsters.  \"Whilst the unfair issues we highlight continue and potential breaches in Scots and European legislation exist, the Scottish government should seriously consider suspending funding (direct or indirect) to clubs pending an independent review.  \"The challenge for Real Grassroots and the Public Petition Committee has always been to change the poor practices of our senior clubs and stand up for young players who have and continue to be mistreated by a system that ensures all control is in the hands of professional football clubs.\" Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People has also previously called for compensation payments for young players moving between clubs to be \"abolished immediately\" on the grounds that they are \"overly restrictive and unfair\". The payments are designed to compensate clubs for the money they have invested in training and developing a young player who wishes to move to another club. Earlier this year, SPFL clubs agreed changes to the compensation scheme following recommendations made by a working party chaired by SFA president Campbell Ogilvie. The working party concluded that FIFA regulations \"clearly permit\" football associations to adopt a system for the financial reward of clubs investing in the training and education of young players.  It also said the Scottish FA youth development programme Club Academy Scotland provided \"the most suitable vehicle to introduce a uniform, fair and consistent mechanism for the reimbursement of youth training costs.\" The Public Petitions Committee can be watched live, or later on demand, at  .

{"article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Bosses discuss the challenge of expanding internationally The leaders of firms seeking global success would do well to heed Aesop's fable of the race between the hare and the slow-moving - but ultimate winner - the tortoise. Similarly in the global race for growth, it is businesses who are prepared to play the long game that will win. When Stefano Pessina tried to secure Alliance Boots' first deal in China it was not a matter of simply agreeing terms and then signing the relevant documents. In fact, it took years of analysis and discussions before executive chairman Mr Pessina was even in a position to try to negotiate terms. Eventually in 2005, Alliance Boots secured an agreement to take a 50% stake in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals, one of China's largest drug wholesalers. But even after this, it took a further two-and-a-half years to get the deal approved by all the relevant authorities. In 2012 it did its second China deal - buying a minority stake in Nanjing Pharmaceutical - but final regulatory approval of this deal is still pending. This is the reality of doing business in China - it takes a very long time, much longer than similar deals in the West, says Mr Pessina. \"When you approach China, you have to approach it with a mindset which is slightly different. You have to be prepared to live in a different world. You have to be even more flexible than you have to be when working in the Western world.\" Mr Pessina says the Chinese think much longer term compared with those in the West, and he says they also tend to change their mind frequently. He wants Alliance Boots, via further tie-ups with local partners, to become a major player in China so that it can benefit from its rapid rate of growth, but says it will take at least five years to fulfil this ambition. The fact that Alliance Boots is a private company makes it easier to carry out these kind of long-term deals. But for publicly listed firms, which have to report results to investors every three months, it can be a hard sell. Leadership expert Steve Tappin says companies are often tempted by a \"quick fix\", for example selling the same product or service worldwide, rather than adapting them for local markets. \"The best business leaders shun this approach. They understand it takes time to build lasting relationships, particularly in cultures that are different to their own,\" he says. Online auction site eBay learned the hard way. In 2006 it shut down its main website in China just two years after its launch, having failed to make headway against local rivals. Instead it formed   with a local partner to help operate an online auction business in the country. Critics say it failed to recognise that having a strong US brand would not automatically translate in China. Current chief executive John Donahoe, who was not at the helm during the firm's first foray into China, says the experience taught eBay to follow consumer trends, rather than try to create them. In China it has since focused on helping customers to sell goods as it discovered that was where the interest lay. In Russia, on the other hand, demand to buy goods via eBay is high, so the company has concentrated on making the buying process easier. \"We treat each market a little bit differently. They're all connected in a common technology platform, but balancing that local ownership, while also being part of a global technology platform, that's what we're trying to do,\" says Mr Donahoe. Despite the hurdles, there are clearly vast benefits that come from global expansion.  When Jeff Immelt, chief executive of US giant General Electric (GE), took the helm over a decade ago, some 70% of its operations were in the US. Now it operates in more than 160 countries and more than half of its revenues come from overseas. For him, targeting deals in developing countries is a top priority because their rate of growth vastly outpaces that of the US and he says GE will never be so US-focused again \"unless we are failing horribly\". \"I sit in my office every day and say I've got to have higher market share in China than I have in the United States,\" he says. \"I've got to win Brazil, I've got to win Africa. There's no choice. I've got to, I've got to win those countries.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27465974", "title": ["How to drive firms to global success"]},
{"article": "They take chocolate cake so seriously in Vienna that the city's two main producers once fought a nine-year legal battle about it. The dispute was known as the \"cake war\". The cake in question is the sachertorte, a chocolate sponge covered with chocolate icing, and filed with a layer - or two - of apricot jam.  For many visitors to the Austrian capital, enjoying a slice of delicious sachertorte is an essential thing to do during their stay. And there are two famous, rival places to go for the cake - Hotel Sacher or the Demel cafe. Sacher has been incredibly good at building on their brand, the famous cake, the story line, and, most importantly, maintaining the perception [of being the original]\u201d A classic example of a duopoly, the two businesses more than dominate the sachertorte market, both in Austria, and overseas via online sales. The legal battle, which ran from 1954 to 1963, was centred on which had the right to call its sachertorte the \"original\" one. The case was complicated by the fact that the son of the chef credited with inventing the cake, in the 19th Century, had connections to both businesses. However, eventually an out-of-court settlement was agreed, under which Hotel Sacher became the one that could say it was the original producer of the sachertorte. As the years have progressed, this has given Hotel Sacher a massive branding advantage over Demel, helping it to be able to sell both more cakes, and at a higher price. With many small and medium-sized firms around the world in duopoly situations, such as the two pubs in a village, or the two hairdressers on the same suburban street, the battle between Hotel Sacher and Demel is a good case study with which to explore how a business can best deal with having just the one big rival. The two companies and aficionados may disagree, but the rival sachertortes taste very similar.  Silia Eleftheriadou, who lives in Vienna and blogs about the city under the name The Viennese Girl, says the two cakes are \"pretty difficult to distinguish\". Duopoly firms typically invest hugely in their brand, in their providence, in convincing the customer that they are the real authentic product, even if they are pretty similar to their rival\u201d Yet Hotel Sacher, which remains family owned, outsells Demel by five to one. Hotel Sacher sells about 360,000 sachertortes per year, while Demel - which is owned by an Austrian catering group - sells about 67,500. And Hotel Sacher charges a fair bit more. Via its website a 19cm (7.5in) diameter sachertorte costs 36.50 euros ($50.40; \u00a329.80). Meanwhile, Demel will sell you a 20cm sachertorte for 30.70 euros. But how much of Hotel Sacher's lead over its rival comes down to it being able to call its sachertorte the original one? Branding expert Martin Lindstrom says having original tag has been an \"important factor\", but adds that Hotel Sacher has done a lot more to successfully raise awareness of its brand. \"Sacher has been incredibly good at building on their brand, the famous cake, the story line, and, most importantly, maintaining the perception [of being the original],\" he says. Mr Lindstrom adds that Hotel Sacher has simply worked hard to make its name better known or \"more visible\" than Demel. Brian Morgan, professor of entrepreneurship at Cardiff Metropolitan University, says that companies in a duopoly situation, such as Hotel Sacher and Demel, \"have to take into account their competitor in everything they do\". Instead of just focusing on the needs of customers, duopoly businesses \"always have to second guess what the other is doing\". Prof Morgan adds that the price or price differentiation between the two companies's products usually \"gravitates towards a stable level that they can both just about live with\". As a result of this he says that the two companies are \"forced to do everything other than price competition to get an advantage\". Being in a duopoly is a much more strategic game than being in a big marketplace with many other companies\u201d \"So it comes down to things like marketing or branding, these become vital,\" says Prof Morgan. \"Duopoly firms typically invest hugely in their brand, in their provenance, in convincing the customer that they are the real authentic product, even if they are pretty similar to their rival.\" Kevin Mole, associate professor of enterprise at Warwick Business School, agrees that firms in a duopoly have to constantly look at the other company. \"You can consider cutting your prices to get an advantage, but what if your rival follows suit?\" he says. \"You could start a price war, and would you win it? You have to work out the outcome of every possible scenario.\" Instead, Dr Mole says it is a safer bet for a duopoly company to focus on having the better reputation. \"Say, for example, you have two hairdressers in a village, over time one will be viewed as the better one,\" he says. \"You want to be that business.\" Dr Mole adds: \"Being in a duopoly is a much more strategic game than being in a big marketplace with many other companies.\" To help raise brand awareness, both Demel and Hotel Sacher often send their chefs to various functions around the world to promote their cakes. And in recent years Demel, which employs 100 people, has opened a shop in New York.  Demel's biggest overseas markets are Italy, Russia, France and Japan, while Hotel Sacher's main foreign markets are Germany, the US, China and also Japan. At Hotel Sacher, which employs 360 people, 50 directly involved in making its sachertorte, chief executive Elisabeth Gurtler says you \"can taste the difference\" between its cake and that of Demel's. She adds: \"It is a big difference.\" ", "subject": "Business", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27326358", "title": ["Vienna's chocolate cake war"]},

{"article": "Higher fares for flights and ferries helped to push the rate of inflation up in April, the first increase in the rate for 10 months. The Consumer Prices Index, rose to 1.8% in April from 1.6% in March,  The ONS said the timing of Easter, which fell in April this year, was likely to have had an impact on travel costs. It said the cost of petrol was also higher than the same month a year ago.  You've probably noticed that flights and ferries get more expensive around holiday times, but that effect is particularly noticeable in these figures. Inflation had been falling since last June (except for one unchanged month) and most of the categories were down again in April.  But the transport category pushed overall annual inflation up 0.4 percentage points all by itself, reflecting an 18% monthly rise in air fares and 22% rise in sea fares. Why such a difference? Because last year Easter Sunday was at the end of March while this year it was in mid-April, and that pushed flight and ferry costs up so much that it negated all other effects.  The increase in travel and fuel costs were offset to some extent by a fall in the cost of food. April's rise in the CPI rate suggests that the cost of living is once again increasing faster than wage rises. The most recent figures on earnings showed that they rose at an annual rate of 1.7% in the three months to March.  However, Ben Brettell, economics editor at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said he still expected wages to outpace inflation in the long term.  \"It looks like we could see a period of modest real wage growth with wages increasing marginally faster than prices over the next year or so.\" The rate of inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) was unchanged at 2.5%, the ONS said. Despite the increase in the CPI inflation measure, the rate is still below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said he expected the rate of inflation to remain below its target for the next two years. Capital Economics economist Samuel Tombs said the rise in the rate was \"a blip\" due to the timing of Easter. \"We continue to think that Consumer Price inflation should ease to as low as 1% by the end of this year and remain comfortably below the 2% target in 2015,\" he said.

It may seem like science fiction but is actually a scene from a  . It is just one example of how yesterday's sci-fi has become today's battlefield fact. This miniature tank, only one metre long and made by Qinetiq North America, is one of a host of unmanned air, sea and land vehicles that are being used by militaries across the globe. More than 90 countries now operate such systems, and it is an industry which will be worth $98bn (\u00a358bn) between 2014-23, says research company IHS. \"The USA remains the prime market and a main driver,\" says IHS's Derrick Maple. \"But many countries are building up their indigenous unmanned system capabilities.\" Qinetiq's roaming robots are designed to aid soldiers in reconnaissance or surveillance, or to go into heavily booby-trapped areas where it might be too risky to send in troops. An enemy tank and a friendly tank might look pretty similar to a machine\u201d Kitted out with either a grenade launcher or a machine gun, the firm's latest version    - is certainly lethal, but independent it is not. It relies on a soldier controlling it remotely, and only operates up to distances of about 800m (2,600ft). However, many critics worry that marrying advances like these in robotics and miniaturisation, with developments in artificial intelligence (AI) could lead, if not to the Terminator, then perhaps to its crude precursor.  Others argue that such AI developments would take many decades, and that for the foreseeable future there will need to be a \"human in the loop\", overseeing such systems. Yet already, a few autonomous weapons are in use which themselves decide whether or not to attack a target. Take  , for instance.  This is what its manufacturers, IAI, call a \"fire and forget\" autonomous weapon - or a \"loitering munition\" in military jargon.  Once launched from a vehicle behind the battle zone, Harpy - effectively a guided missile with wings - loiters over an area until it finds a suitable target, in this case enemy radars.  Crucially, once a radar is detected it is the drone itself that decides whether or not to attack.  True, Harpy is only launched if its operators suspect there will be enemy radars to be attacked, but automation like this is likely to become more common. Yet the real obstacle to the more widespread use of what some call \"killer robots\" is getting them to tell friend from foe. \"A tank doesn't look that much like a pick-up truck\", says  \"But an enemy tank and a friendly tank might look pretty similar to a machine. \"Militaries are not going to want to deploy something on the battlefield that might accidentally go against their own forces.\" It is a point echoed by General Larry James, the US Air Force's deputy chief of staff for intelligence. \"We are years and years away, if not decades, from having confidence in an artificial intelligence system that can do discrimination and make those decisions.\" It is the United States which dominates the market for Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) - over the next decade it is forecast to spend more than three times as much on UAVs as China - the next biggest spender.  UAVs also account for the bulk of spending on unmanned systems as a whole - budgets for land or sea-based systems are small by comparison.  Despite the difficulties in developing this technology, the   published last year, says that \"unmanned systems continue to hold much promise for the war-fighting tasks ahead\". It concludes by saying that once technical challenges are overcome, \"advances in capability can be readily achieved... well beyond what is achievable today\". One of those at the forefront of this research is Sanjiv Singh, robotics professor at Carnegie Mellon University and chief executive of Near Earth Autonomy. Working for the US military and Darpa, the US defence research agency, his team has successfully demonstrated an unmanned autonomous helicopter.  We have to take action now in order to stop it\u201d Using remote-sensing lasers the aircraft builds terrain maps, works out safe approaches and selects its own landing sites - all without a pilot or operator.

This will be a huge step away from traditional drones which, he says, \"are driven by GPS-derived data\".  \"If you make a mistake in the flight plan, then they'll drive happily into a mountain if it's in the way.\" With all the money being put into this sector, autonomous weapons systems will eventually be developed, says independent defence analyst Paul Beaver. \"It's just like nuclear weapons, you can't disinvent it,\" he told the  Alarmingly, it is not rogue states that he is most worried about. \"I think we're about a decade away from organised crime having these sorts of systems and selling them to terrorist groups.\" Earlier this month delegates from 117 countries met at the UN in Geneva to discuss a  .

In 2010, for instance, computer trading algorithms contributed to the \"flash crash\" that briefly wiped $1 trillion off stock market valuations. \"It illustrates it's very hard to halt these decision-making processes, because these systems operate a lot quicker than human beings can,\" he says. Paradoxically, it is the civilian and not the military use of AI that could be the most threatening, he warns. \"As it's not military there won't be the same kinds of focus on safety and ethics,\" says Dr O'Heigeartaigh. \"It is possible something may get out of our control, especially if you get an algorithm that is capable of self-improvement and re-writing its own code.\"  In other words, maybe it is not killer robots we have to worry about, but killer computers.

{"article": "Reeling from a run - the first on a British bank for more than a century - and nationalisation soon after, the state of Northern Rock was mirrored by its Sunderland offices. The sparsely populated premises at Doxford Business Park had fallen into such a poor condition that part of the roof would eventually blow off. Now, the building has been renovated into the sleek, open-plan nerve centre of UK Asset Resolution (Ukar) - the Treasury-owned company that has the job of running down the rump of the Rock. Those in charge believe that the state-of-the-art, largely transparent customer operations centre reflects the way in which the business is now run, albeit with very different ambitions. Ukar oversees the shaky side of the mortgage books of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley - the parts of the banks that could not be sold off to the likes of Virgin. Its job is not to offer new home loans but to run down those old, riskier deals while keeping a roof over mortgage-holders' heads when possible. But the boss, chief executive Richard Banks, doesn't like the phrase \"bad bank\". Only 5% of mortgage customers - nearly 30,000 people - are in arrears with mortgage repayments, a figure that is falling. The Treasury is steadily being paid back, with the announcement of further loan repayments to government expected imminently. It is not a household name. When asked, some customers thought Ukar (pronounced U-kar) was a motor dealership. In fact, letters to customers are headed with the names of the specific lenders - Northern Rock Asset Management, Bradford & Bingley or Mortgage Express. Yet, the decisions it makes affect the homes and day-to-day finances of nearly half a million people, many of whom stretched themselves almost to breaking point during the housing boom prior 2008.  Amit Rao, 32, is typical. He bought a one-bedroom flat in Watford at a time when he says lenders were \"handing mortgages out like Smarties\". He signed up to Northern Rock's Together mortgage, which was popular before the credit crunch and allowed homebuyers to borrow the full price of the property plus an unsecured loan on top. \"I thought it was wise to invest, and that you couldn't go wrong with property,\" he says. But things did go wrong for him. The bank collapsed and had to be rescued by government, the value of his property fell, and his job moved further away from home. Northern Rock Asset Management can no longer offer fixed-rate deals, so when his deal expired he had to move to the Rock's more expensive standard variable rate (SVR). No other lenders were willing to take him on. This is common among Northern Rock Asset Management mortgage holders. Nine out of 10 of them are on the SVR of 4.79%. Mr Rao moved back in with his parents to cut his costs. Eventually he changed the conditions of the mortgage so he could rent the flat out to tenants, but the rent he gets in does not cover the mortgage repayments. The property is still worth less than his outstanding mortgage - known as negative equity - and he feels stuck. \"I can't really move on with my life,\" he says. \"My biggest fear is that interest rates go up soon, and rise to a level that I can't sustain repayments.\" He says he would welcome some guidance and communication from the lender, explaining his options. Ukar says that it can help customers in this situation review their monthly incomings and outgoings and may put borrowers in touch with independent mortgages brokers who could help find a new fixed-rate deal with another lender.  Yet, chief executive Mr Banks points out: \"It is not our job to be a social service.\" Still, he admits he worries about the effect that an interest rate rise would have on customers, predicting the first increase in the Bank rate to come early in 2015. He says that 25% of their mortgage customers could face serious difficulties in making mortgage repayments were the Bank rate to rise to 5%. It is currently at a record low of 0.5%. Meanwhile, there will always be those who face money problems as a result of redundancy or marital breakdown, he says, who will start getting behind on their bills. Customers who miss a mortgage repayment can expect a phone call within two days. Text messages and letters may follow. But, says Jim Waddell - Ukar's head of customer assistance, this is not a debt collection call, but an attempt to prevent any problems spiralling out of control. A huge banner hanging from the ceiling above his team displays the phone number of the National Debtline, aimed at encouraging those struggling with debts to get help from the charity in drawing up a repayment plan. Elsewhere in the Sunderland complex, calls have been made to prevent more long-term debt troubles. Every customer with an interest-only mortgage deal, where the term will end and the final lump sum will be due within 10 years, received letters asking how the borrower intends to pay off the balance. Every lender has done something similar, following an agreement with the regulator, but only for those with terms ending by 2020. From September, those with interest-only deals where the balance is due in more than 10 years' time, will also start to receive letters from Ukar asking about their financial plans.  Mr Banks, whose career included director level positions at Alliance and Leicester, says that it is refreshing - but unusual - to be a mortgage lender who does not have to worry about sales. His job, and his target, within the next 10 years is to pay back the \u00a350bn or so of government loans that it needed to start the job of running down a book of 553,853 home loans worth \u00a362.3bn. The more successful Ukar is at running down the mortgage book, the quicker the organisation will disappear, which makes staff motivation a challenge. But, for now, Mr Banks - a DIY enthusiast - and his staff take pride in having \"put together and repaired\" two broken bits of the UK banking system, Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley. \"It is testament to what skilled operators our staff have to be. They have to be behavioural psychologists while obeying the rules,\" he says. Ultimately, their success will depend on whether - like the refurbished offices in Sunderland - they can keep a roof over their customers' heads.

The firm, which has 10 bilingual managers, has contracted 1,000 temporary staff to handle increased work during the month-long event. MNS may be a small operation, but it has some very high-powered clients, including World Cup organiser Fifa, and visiting officials from Australia and France, whose national teams have both qualified for the tournament.

And the service has to be the best.\" With protests - some violent -   by people angered by the high cost of hosting the World Cup, security during the event is going to be a big deal.

Yet in addition to the 150,000 troops and police officers that will be on duty, more than 2,000 private security companies, often small firms like MNS, will also be at the heart of the operation. While Brazil's small-scale security firms cannot compete with the nationwide reach of their larger rivals, many make up for this by employing highly experienced and knowledgeable staff, such as individuals who have previously worked for the armed forces or the police. This, as in the case of MNS, enables them to secure high-profile clients. And with no less than 600,000 overseas visitors set to attend the World Cup across 12 host cities, there is a lot of security work to share around. We're asked which are the best hotels far away from the favelas, which are the most secure restaurants to eat in\u201d Brazil hosting the World Cup has also seen security sector entrepreneurs from overseas arrive in the country to offer their services and secure business, such as British couple Mark and Tanya Harris. They set up their sports and security consultancy, Foot in Brazil, in Rio at the end of last year, and have seen demand swell since the start of 2014. The pair, who have no direct employees, are helping teams, organisations and delegations plan their stays in Brazil, including carrying out risk assessments and managing private security. Among their clients are media companies, sponsors and VIPs. Mr Harris, 32, a former British Army officer, and Mrs Harris, 35, who previously worked for the British Olympic Association, says the main security concern is the potential threat of protests or other disturbances. After the World Cup, Foot in Brazil will turn its attention to the Rio Olympics and Paralympics in 2016, but Mr Harris says he hopes the company will continue beyond those Games. \"Foot in Brazil was formed because of the major event opportunity in Brazil with the World Cup, Olympic and Paralympic Games all taking place in a two-year window,\" he says. \"However, we have looked at this as a long-term project and will assess the opportunity to continue to do business in Brazil as we approach 2016.  \"With the infrastructure legacy that has been created from these major events we hope that Brazil will continue to bid for and attract major sporting events.\" Mario Baptista de Oliveira, who is general director of Grupo Protege, one of Brazil's largest security companies, offers an interesting insight into what foreign clients are requesting from his company and its many smaller rivals. Despite efforts in recent years by authorities in Rio to remove drug gangs from the city's favelas or shanty towns, a policy called \"pacification\", Mr Baptista de Oliveira says important visitors for the World Cup want to be as far away as possible from such areas. \"Brazil's image abroad is very bad, it's criticised a lot for crime and drugs,\" he says. \"In Rio, the big worry is the favelas. We're asked which are the best hotels far away from the favelas, which are the most secure restaurants to eat in.\" While both authorities and commentators in Brazil are hopeful that the World Cup will be both peaceful and successful, and football-loving Brazilians get enthused by the tournament, Paulo Ricardo Franco, regional director of Grupo GR, a Sao Paulo-based security firm, says the sector is ready for anything. \"The importance of private security is about prevention,\" he adds.

{"article": "It's 30 years since the British decimal halfpenny was being phased out. Why did the UK hang on to a tiny coin for so long? Before everyone gets misty-eyed about the bronze halfpenny, it's worth remembering how annoying Britain's least loved coin, notorious for getting lost in trousers and furniture upholstery, was.   People were commonly said not to bother to bend down in the street to pick it up if they dropped one.   \"In terms of the coins in your pocket, it's useless,\" the National Consumer Council told the Herald Tribune in 1983. News stand workers in the early 1980s couldn't even give the unloved halfpenny away, according to the paper. \"We've got a bagful in the till, and although customers give them to us in payments sometimes, we can't hand any out,\" vendor Danny Curbishley complained. The coin's pifflingness - or necessity - was regular fodder for the Times' letter pages. \"Sir, I can scarcely believe that writers of letters bemoaning the demise of the halfpenny coin, because they would not be able to deal with some small-apertured possession without it, are being serious,\" wrote Pamela Johnson in February 1984.  \"Sir, Some may dispute the 'rounding-up' or down, of the halfpenny coin, but let not its existence be imperilled. It is indispensable for levelling off pendulum clocks,\" countered Priscilla Glover in December.  The then Chancellor Nigel Lawson announced the coin's demise in a written Commons answer in 1984, saying \"most people would be glad to get rid of them\". The  Royal Mint stopped making them at the end of February, and it ceased to be legal tender in December. But the curious thing about the coin is not that it was abolished, rather that it lasted a full 13 years after its introduction with decimalisation in 1971. The Treasury's delay in ending the halfpenny arose from fears that if the coin was abolished, retailers would raise prices to the nearest penny, which would in turn contribute to inflation. By 1984, the government had got to a point where it believed so few transactions would be affected, there would be no measurable impact.  When it came down to it, Bank of England figures show inflation rose by 0.5% in January 1985. But accounts at the Bank in the subsequent months did not make mention of the removal of the halfpenny as a reason. A spokesman today says inflation was more likely to be down to a decline in exchange rates or a rise in commodity prices. Dr Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint Museum, agrees that it is \"profoundly unlikely\" that the coin's withdrawal had any impact on inflation. \"If you think of how many transactions occurred in 1984, the idea that the lowest denomination in British currency had an impact is extremely unlikely. There were far many bigger economic influences at play. The same questions were raised with decimalisation, and that was a whole system, not one coin. The conclusion was even if retailers did adjust their prices by rounding up, the impact would be negligible in the economy of the nation.\" A study - albeit rather unscientific - of the price of a couple of items suggests fears all prices would be rounded up didn't materialise. The second class stamp rose from 12.5p in 1983 to 13p in 1984, then dropped to 12p in 1985. The price of a dog licence went from 37.5p in 1984 to 37p in 1985.  And supermarket chains pledged to round prices down rather than up. Apart from annoyance to ordinary people, the reasons for getting rid of the coin were compelling.  \"High inflation in the late 1970s had devalued the coin to the point that it was insignificant and costly to produce,\" says the British Museum's modern money curator Thomas Hockenhull. \"By 1984, it had an impractically small value and purchasing power.\"  At the time, there was speculation the coin had become more expensive to make than its face value. Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, says the history of currency is littered with cases of when melted coins may have exceeded their purchasing power.  Size was another sticking point. The halfpenny was tiny - about 17mm diameter compared with the current penny's 20mm - and critics complained many fell out of pockets and got stuck behind sofas.    Research shows the optimum size of a coin is between 19mm-22mm, according to Clancey. \"17mm is still fine - anything between 15mm and 28mm is practical - but it's at the lower end. At the other end of the scale the British crown [in 1707] was 38mm and was never popular,\" he says. The halfpenny also had an image problem because it wasn't very aesthetically pleasing as well, according to Hockenhull.    \"It didn't have the Royal Coat of Arms like the pound coin, an image of Britannia or the ship of the pre-decimal halfpenny. It was a boring looking coin - not one I can't imagine anyone thinking beautiful. It also didn't symbolise a national identity. The halfpenny was always a part of a penny, never its own entity. Back in the 1300s they used to literally cut pennies in half to get halfpennies, or quarters for a farthing,\" he says.    But having killed the halfpenny, why has the UK never done something about the penny? Hileman says the story of the halfpenny fits into a broader question over \"the big problem of small change\".  \"There's an economic impact to having fewer denominations - it can create friction when the denomination isn't micro enough to accommodate the transactions people want to do. But the halfpenny fits into a historical problem of what happens to currency when it's not as efficient as it could be - in most cases it comes down to the cost it takes to produce versus its economic utility,\" he says.   The   from circulation last year because production costs exceeded its monetary value. There has been a long-running   and the   has been questioned. In 1984, not many people mourned the loss of the halfpenny. \"The decimal halfpenny didn't have a long history. It was never top of the bill or had a starring role,\" says Clancy. But he says to dismiss the coin's value entirely would do it a disservice.  \"The halfpenny played an important role in the important transition to a new currency system. It was a point of familiarity. A  way of reassuring people things hadn't changed too much,\" he says.

{"article": "Hooves pound on metal slats as wild goats are loaded on to a lorry at an outback yard more than 700km (435 miles) west of Sydney.  No-one knows just how many goats are roaming the rugged expanses of the Australian outback, but feral herds have become part of a lucrative industry.  Australia is the world's largest exporter of goat meat, and suppliers believe the trade is about to experience a boom. \"I can see it doubling. It's just got that potential to keep growing - the amount of feral goats,\" says Tim Walmsley, manager of the Ausgoat depot near Cobar in New South Wales. There are a lot of people making a living out of [goat meat]\u201d \"They say the Western division of New South Wales has a population of anywhere between a million and two million goats. It's a huge number of goats that can be supplied,\"  The yard is a short drive from a town famous for its copper mines, and the road snakes through the bush and the distinctive red dust.   A flash of white hair in the scrub reveals a small mob of wild goats foraging for food.  These hardy animals arrived with the first European settlers, and they've adapted well to Australia's harsh, dry conditions.  Around the world, goat milk, hair and skins have been used for centuries, and Australia is at the heart of the global trade in meat. The Ausgoat processing centre on the outskirts of Cobar handles 100,000 animals every year.   The latest skittish group pace nervously in a small pen.  These are youngsters, about 10 months old, that will end up on dinner tables in Sydney, Brisbane or an Asian city far beyond Australia.  In the next compound are larger billies capable of breaking bones or even killing cattle dogs.  Feral goats are considered pests that poach valuable water and food from livestock.   They are usually caught by farmers, often in traps by waterholes, or are mustered on larger properties using gyrocopters or planes, and will be carted off to abattoirs around the country.   The meat is either sold to domestic consumers or to a growing international market, particularly in Asia. \"There is money to be made in it. It is also a big industry. There are a lot of people making a living out of it,\" Mr Walmsley says.   Media requires JavaScript to play. Australia's goat exporters predict the market is set to boom \"I'm here, then we've got a truck driver that comes and gets them, then you've got the processor, the abattoirs - they're all making a living out of it. Everybody gets a fair share.\"    We've seen recent export orders from Malaysia, China, Korea and the Philippines\u201d There is also a thriving trade in farmed animals. On a property near the town of Orange, a small herd of meaty specimens roam.  These are Boer goats, a robust variety brought to Australia from South Africa in the 1980s. They are part of a profitable business sending live exports to Asia. \"We mainly sell to Malaysia and Thailand, but our goats mainly go for breeding, so the people who come here to look at my animals are looking for a good quality stud animal that will fit into what their breeding programme is in Thailand or Malaysia,\" saya Christine Andrews, who runs the farm with her husband Ron.  Fame and Goddess are keys to the success of this family-owned enterprise. These are breeding does, or nannies, that are treated almost like pets.   Each has a name: Grace was a champion at a local show, and there are high hopes for Britannia and Japonica. Their offspring will eventually be sold overseas, most probably to build up herds in Asia.  Other popular markets for live exports include Singapore and Brunei, but it is the multi-million dollar trade in meat that has risen sharply in recent years. Australia's goat exports have doubled in the past decade. While much is sold to the United States and Taiwan, there is a growing appetite elsewhere in Asia.  \"In recent months the Chinese have shown a great interest,\" Joe Portelli, a livestock sales specialist based in western New South Wales, told the BBC.  \"We've seen a lot of Chinese come to our market in Dubbo. We run a sale there every three months. We've seen a lot of Asians come to that, especially the Chinese,\" A weakening of the Australian dollar in recent months has also helped to boost global sales. \"The meat trade seems to have picked up since the dollar's come back down a little bit,\" Mr Portelli says.   \"We've seen recent export orders come in from such countries as Malaysia, China, Korea and the Philippines, and those orders have just lifted the price of the goats up astronomically. \"It just seems to be getting bigger and bigger each week, each month and each year.\"  The industry has had its problems with inconsistent supply and quality, but goat suppliers here insist that their animals are among the best in the world, and that exports are boosting not only the Australian economy but are helping to feed an ever hungrier Asia.

{"article": "There was a time when a strongly worded letter was the only means of having your complaint heard by a company, but is tweeting now the best way to get your gripe to the front of the queue? When Angie Konrad tweeted that the heating was switched off on her train, she did not expect the operators of that line to read the message and alert the driver to switch the heating on so she could enjoy the rest of her journey in comfort. Twitter is enabling companies to engage in a much warmer relationship with their clientele, but when things go wrong for the customer, it is also the best way to get grievances resolved quickly and in real time says comedian David Schneider, who is also a Twitter expert and runs social media consultancy That Lot. \"If you're 29th in the queue on a phone call, only you know that. It's you and the person who's keeping you on hold. But if you tweet, it's public and it could be picked up, and I think companies are very aware of that,\" says Mr Schneider. A bad review or negative comment can be retweeted by millions, and companies are often keen to defuse customer anger very quickly in a public space such as Twitter. If it is done cleverly, it can even work in a company's favour. \"I remember there was a time where there was an outage on O2 on the network and they were getting a hell of a lot of bad press,\" says Mr Schneider. \"People were tweeting very aggressively at the O2 account and about O2 - it was trending. \"They happened to have a very skilful, self-deprecating, humorous person on their Twitter feed at that time who dealt with the abuse in a very amusing way.\" Mr Schneider says it was interesting to see a wave of criticism turn to positive comments from the customers.  When a complaint is treated with a personal touch, it can even go viral on Twitter. For instance one Argos customer service representative chose to reply to customer Immy \"Badman\" Bugti's complaint   he had used in his tweet. A shortened version of the messages read: \"@Argos_online: Yo, wen you gettin' da ps4 tings in moss side? Ain't waitin' no more.\" \"@BadManBugti: Safe Badman. We gettin' sum more PS4 tings in wivin da next week, y'get me.\" The company response from Argos was retweeted over 1,500 times within the space of a few hours. Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, says consumers are becoming much more savvy and expect organisations to relate to them as real life human beings and not simply transactions any more. \"One of the key things that we're seeing in the changing world we're all living in is that we want to have better dialogue, not just monologue, with our organisations,\" says Ms Causon.  According to a poll of 2,000 people by the communications agency Fishburn Hedges and Echo Research in April 2012,   to contact a big company and 65% said it was a better way than call centres to get in touch with companies. It was not just confined to the young either, with 27% of people aged over 55 having used social media to complain. Ms Causon expects complaints via Twitter to only increase in popularity with the growth of social media. \"A lot of us at the moment are not complaining necessarily through Twitter, but as we progress, it certainly is a medium of choice, and organisations will need to be able to respond appropriately,\" says Ms Causon. With almost 15,000 complaints a day about financial services in 2013, according to  , Hannah Moore from BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme monitored the Twitter feeds of eight of the major banks for a working day and found problems were not necessarily resolved on Twitter, but it did help push requests to the front of the queue. \"When customers complained about hanging on premium rate phonelines, [some] staff promised to call them instead, and if you're confused about which department you need to get in touch with, Twitter's really helpful,\" she says. \"The best banks provided the correct phone numbers, forms and web links within minutes - again saving you time on an 0845 number.\" According to Ms Causon it's important for the consumer to be responsible about choosing the right channel for their complaint too. \"A banking problem in itself doesn't necessarily lend itself to a very public place like Twitter, so I think it's about the nature of the problem and what you're looking to have resolved.\" If Twitter is making it easier to complain, it also makes it easier for consumers to give positive feedback to companies too, so there is no danger we will turn into a nation of whingers.

{"article": "The maths skills of teenagers in parts of the deep south of the United States are worse than in countries such as Turkey and barely above countries such as Chile and Mexico. An international study of maths ability in the US shows how individual states would have performed if they were ranked against other countries, using the OECD's Pisa results as a benchmark. The study also shows that  . This analysis, from academics at Harvard and Stanford in the US and Munich University in Germany, punctures the idea that middle-class US pupils are high achievers. Southern states Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are among the weakest performers, with results similar to developing countries such as Kazakhstan and Thailand. West Virginia is also among the group of lowest performers, where maths levels are far below western European countries or high-performing Asian education systems in South Korea or Singapore. The US has been a mediocre performer in international education tests, based on average performance across the country, but this study shows how this average conceals a remarkably wide range of successes and failures. There is a band of high achieving states across the north of the US, where maths results would be as good as many successful European and Asian countries. If Massachusetts had been considered as a separate entity it would have been the seventh best at maths in the world.  Minnesota, Vermont, New Jersey and Montana are all high performers. But there is a long tail of underachievement that dips well below the levels of secondary school pupils in wealthier western European countries. It dips into levels closer to the developing world. New York and California are similar in ability to countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, well below the averages for the US and OECD industrialised countries. There are 23 US states which would be ranked below 30th place in an international ranking of 34 OECD countries at maths. The study also overturns the idea that middle-class children in the US are as good as their international counterparts. It shows that in the US, as in other countries, children from better educated, wealthier families will achieve better results than poorer children. Among children of parents with a low level of education, only 17% were proficient in maths, compared with 43% of children from well-educated families. But this standard of maths among well-educated families in US is well below their counterparts in other countries. In Poland, 71% of children from well-educated families were likely to be proficient in maths. In Germany, 64% of better-off children were proficient at maths and 55% in France. There is a denial phenomenon\u201d Even such a poor performance was unlikely to set off alarm bells, said Paul Peterson, report co-author and professor of government at Harvard University and director of the Program on Education Policy and Governance at the Harvard Kennedy School. \"There is a denial phenomenon,\" says Prof Peterson. He said the tendency to make internal comparisons between different groups within the US had shielded the country from recognising how much they are being overtaken by international rivals. \"The American public has been trained to think about white versus minority, urban versus suburban, rich versus poor,\" he said. The outcome was a misleading sense of complacency about middle-class education, which always appeared to be ahead, he said. Report authors, Prof Peterson, Eric Hanushek at Stanford University and Ludger Woessmann at the University of Munich, wrote in Education Next magazine: \"Lacking good information, it has been easy even for sophisticated Americans to be seduced by apologists who would have the public believe the problems are simply those of poor kids in central city schools. \" \"Our results point in quite the opposite direction,\" . The underachievement in some southern states was a reflection of deep-rooted historical divides and disadvantages, Prof Peterson said, such as slavery and segregation. But the study raises questions about how other southern states can buck the trend, such as Texas. Among the children of poorly educated families, Texas is a spectacularly strong performer, equivalent to sixth place in the OECD rankings, just behind Finland.  California raised another set of negative questions, said Prof Peterson, with a very low performance. \"California was historically thought to have a good education system, but it's plunged since the 1970s,\" he said. It has an economy big enough to match many OECD countries, but in education comparisons it would be a lightweight, its maths performance weaker than in almost any other industrialised country. \"It's where the rubber hits the road,\" said Prof Peterson.   There were long-term implications from all this, he said. Industries were concentrating around areas with successful education systems. And success in education was linked to healthier and wealthier lives for individuals. Rebecca Winthrop, director for the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, said the findings would \"raise eyebrows\". In particular, she thought it would be a wake-up call for well-educated parents who thought that worries about education were a problem for \"other people's children\". But she said it was important to remember the great size of the country - and that even getting down to state level there were still huge underlying disparities and inequalities. \"California is in itself a huge place,\" she said. And any aggregate results are going to hide the gulf between schools serving the Silicon Valley super rich and the migrant poor. Andreas Schleicher, responsible for the OECD's Pisa tests, said this study was a challenge to middle-class households who thought that debates about school standards did not apply to them. \"The general perception has typically been that this is mainly a concern around poor schools in poor neighbourhoods and so middle-class families have often not been particularly engaged in this,\" he said. In the short term, he said, the US economy would be insulated against this underachievement because it still had a \"strong skill base, simply because it was the first economy investing in universal education in the 1960s, and those people still make up a large part of the workforce\". But this legacy would not last forever.  \"As time goes by, skill gaps will become increasingly apparent,\" he said. The report authors conclude that as well as focusing on the gap between rich and poor, the US needs to pay more attention to the rear lights of their international rivals as they race away ahead of them. 1.

It could either get brands designed exclusively for it, or simply sell their clothes in its stores\u201d M&S is a nice environment, but it feels more akin to Primark. It has a very good but basic shop fit, but it doesn't turn people on. Customers want excitement and glamour.  For a long time it has traded its own brand only, but it's a new world and if it wants to be a department store for clothing it needs to think seriously about whether it should bring in third-party brands. It could either get this designed exclusively for it, or simply sell their clothes in its stores.  Its customers spend a fortune at Hobbs and Jigsaw - why are they not buying such clothes at M&S? It also needs to be much more segmented in its approach. While it has sub brands, they are not clear enough in the store and everything merges into one. It would do much better if it focused on doing the basics really well\u201d M&S is suffering an identity crisis. It is not clear what it stands for. It's not appealing to their core customer. More than half of its sales come from shoppers over the age of 55 - they tend to be more conservative and traditional in style. And they are probably not looking for kimono jackets and crop trousers.  M&S is trying too hard to compete with fast fashion chains on the High Street and appeal to a younger audience. This is alienating its older audience, which is really dangerous. It should just focus on classic, basic items: wardrobe essentials such as cardigans, T-shirts, bras, socks and underwear - in a variety of colours and designs. It also needs to get its pricing balance right. Its new ranges launched with Belinda Earl [style director] are more expensive and that's another danger, especially when they're pretty much permanently on promotion.  It should have more dedicated food outlets - offering convenience foods and lunchtime sandwiches\u201d The problem it faces is that its core market is increasingly not being seen as clothing but as food.  It is perceived more as a premium food retailer. So in the UK it should manage a greater switch to food in terms of priority. It's going down that route by opening up smaller convenience food stores. But I think it should have more dedicated food outlets - offering convenience foods and lunchtime sandwiches.  And in its larger stores, it should change its food offering in a way to appeal to people who want something quick and easy. The emergence of fast fashion has undermined its clothing offering, but it is planning to expand internationally where its clothing brand is relatively strong.  It needs to effectively manage this crossover, by making its clothing more up to date and more modern, to try to reinvigorate the brand. If you merged M&S with Next, then you would have online, top fashion, top grub and a top brand\u201d Neither my wife or my two daughters would be seen dead in M&S clothing.

But just 18 months on, the return to booming prices has been so sudden that the   to do exactly the opposite: to slow things down. According to one of the Bank's own top brains, no-one had predicted the \"microwave\" effect. Spencer Dale, the Bank's chief economist, said that just like cooking food, the housing market can pass from cool to hot in the matter of a \"few economic seconds\". Had he continued the analogy, he might well have warned about isolated hotspots being particularly dangerous. So what steps could be taken to cool the market down - or at least to lose the excess steam which all of a sudden has made it such a safety hazard?   The interactive content on this page requires JavaScript Year on year % change Perhaps the easiest fix is to make it harder for homebuyers to borrow money. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, has already expressed particular concerns about those taking out high loan-to-value mortgages.  Some lenders currently offer loans that are more than five times a borrower's income. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) could act to limit such borrowing as soon as next month.  Borrowers could also face stricter \"stress tests\" - meaning that lenders would have to ensure they could still afford repayments if interest rates rose significantly. To an extent this is already happening under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR), which requires lenders to ask tougher questions about affordability. But the FPC could make the rules tougher, or more explicit.  Aside from making it harder to borrow, the FPC could also make it more difficult to lend. Banks and building societies might be forced to raise more capital - i.e. put money aside - to cover riskier borrowers defaulting on their repayments. Doing that would make mortgages more expensive for new borrowers, and so would dampen demand. The banks could face tougher stress tests of their own too, having to prove they would survive in a world of rising interest rates and falling house prices. One interesting idea raised by MPs on the Treasury Committee is whether lending criteria could be specifically tightened in property hotspots, such as London, Cambridge or Aberdeen.  This would be a much more flexible tool - allowing demand to grow in areas like Northern Ireland and the North East of England, where prices have been slow to increase. However, although Spencer Dale said this idea is theoretically possible, the FPC is not thought to be considering it seriously.   While Mr Carney has promised not to use base rates as a means to cool the market, the expectation that they   may already be having the necessary effect. Over the last few weeks some mortgage rates have crept up from record lows.  But the base rate tool is a very blunt instrument. A rise could choke off economic growth. And like all the above methods, it would have no effect on cash buyers, who can account for a third of the market, and who are driving price rises in London in particular. Many economists have argued that the government's Help to Buy scheme - which allows buyers to find a deposit of just 5% - is helping to inflate house prices.  The Bank could advise the government to scale back on the scheme. The Business Secretary, Vince Cable, has already said it should apply to properties up to a maximum value of \u00a3350,000, rather than the current \u00a3600,000. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said the government should follow the Bank's advice. But if Help to Buy has helped to put up house prices, remember it has also helped to increase the supply of housing. Private housebuilding has increased by 34% in the year since the scheme started.  Without it, the shortage of houses might have been worse, so prices might have been even higher.  And that brings us to the other side of this equation: supply, as well as demand. Mr Carney has already identified that while he can do something about demand for housing, he cannot build a single house himself. His own country, Canada, builds more houses than the UK, even though it has nearly half the population.  In the year to March there were  , a rise of just 4% on the previous year. Experts believe the UK as a whole needs to build at least 250,000 homes a year to meet demand, and put a brake on prices. Although building on brownfield sites - like old hospitals or factories - is preferable, there are simply not enough sites to go around, particularly in London and the South East, where the population is rising fastest.   Sam Bowman, research director at the Adam Smith Institute, has argued for a while that local authorities should allow building on greenbelt land. \"By rolling back the greenbelt by just one mile around London, we would have space for one million new homes,\" he said this week. But even the Home Builders Federation, which wants more land made available, does not agree with that idea.   From Russian oligarchs to George Clooney, foreigners moving to central London have helped to raise property prices by as much as 18% this year. In theory that trickles down to the lower reaches of the market, affecting house prices for all. So could foreign sales be limited?  The company selling new flats at Battersea Power Station in London said they would only market them to those \"based in the UK, or who have a commitment to the UK\". However, agents in Hong Kong are still free to try to sell them to clients in Asia. In practice such restrictions are very difficult to achieve. Foreigners buying a home worth more than \u00a3500,000 through a company are already subject to 15% stamp duty. Last year Housing Minister Mark Prisk set up a working group to look at the possibilities of building more pre-fabricated houses. This could enable thousands of flats and homes to be built at a fraction of the cost of traditional properties, and so in theory ease the pressure on prices.  But do not imagine 1960s Butlins-style holiday camps. These involve modern, factory-built units that come complete with built-in kitchens and plumbing. Ten years ago the Labour peer, Lord Prescott, had the same idea, hoping to build homes that cost just \u00a360,000. The resulting development, known as \"Lego Land\", can still be seen in Milton Keynes.  Large builders need large sites to make the returns demanded by shareholders. But in many countries, most properties are built on small sites, by small-scale builders.  According to Jan Crosby of accountants KPMG, 80% of homes in Austria are built in this way. He suggests that such builders could be incentivised to build more, with the help of cheap loans. More people could also be encouraged to build their own homes, where significant savings are possible.  The government has announced up to   will be built, the first of which is planned for  . But while that may ease the housing shortage in that area, the provision of 15,000 new homes over a long period of time is unlikely to have a significant impact on property prices across the UK.
