[{"article": "    Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy endured \"bad breaks\" in a \"frustrating\" second round at the Masters where an 18th-hole putt saw him make the cut by one shot.\n     The two-time major champion started the day one under, but dropped four shots on the back nine to shoot 77 and finish four over par, 11 shots off the lead.\n     \"It was very frustrating,\" said the 24-year-old. \"I just really couldn't get anything to go my way.\n     \"Eleven shots back is going to be nearly impossible to make up.\"  \n     McIlroy, the US Open champion in 2011 and USPGA Championship winner in 2012, had no idea his testing putt on the 18th had to drop if he was to stay in the tournament.\n     He admitted it \"was a bit of a sigh of relief\" to still be involved, but rued his luck during a round in which an approach shot into the 13th green bounced off a sprinkler and into bushes, forcing him to drop a shot.\n     As the last man in the field, the world number nine will \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and will be without a playing partner, while \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     will tee off at 19:45 BST.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. McIlroy's unlucky sprinkler shot at 13     Watson has only ever won one of eight tournaments he has led at the halfway stage, but if McIlroy is to win, he will need to close the biggest deficit in Masters history - an eight stroke come back by Jack Burke in 1956 is the current best.\n     In pursuit of American Watson, Britain's best-placed players going into the weekend are Welshman \n     \n     and Scotland's \n     \n     who both sit on one under par.\n     Gallacher, a Masters debutant, birdied the par-five 15th as he ended the day on the same mark as he started. \n     The 39-year-old hit 12 of 14 fairways from the tee, but admitted he was \"glad to still be in the red numbers\" after a round which included four bogeys.\n     \"You've got to keep your temperament,\" said Gallacher. \"Your acceptance levels here have got to be through the roof, you've just got to hit it, accept it and get on with it. \n     The four par five holes on Augusta National played as the easiest on the golf course on day two. In all, 143 of the 290 birdies on the second day came on these holes, with leader Bubba Watson picking up shots on the back nine's two par fives\n     \"It's a very strategic course. I think everyone at home knows how to play it but it's just a case of trying to do it.\"\n     Donaldson described his standing at six shots behind Watson as \"a good position\", but acknowledged he has \"to try to hit more fairways\" over the weekend after finding just 14 of 28 so far. \n     On day two of the tournament, Augusta National's four par five holes played the easiest statistically, with 143 of the day's 290 birdies and seven eagles arriving on the quartet.\n Welshman Jamie Donaldson missed the cut in his debut Masters appearance in 2013\r\n        \n     was unable to capitalise on their generosity for the second day running and finished one under par for the day and level for the tournament.\n     \"I didn't play the par fives well enough again,\" said 40-year-old Westwood who is still searching for a first major title. \"Over two days, I've made eight fives and that's where you make your scores. You need birdies over the weekend on them. \n     \"There's good scores if you play well and disasters if you start hitting a few wild shots. I'm comfortable out there and can see a way around it.\"\n     US Open champion \n     \n     and fellow Englishman \n     \n     both carded scores of 70 on day two to move to two over for the tournament.\n     The 11th hole, named White Dogwood, played the hardest on the course for the second day. A par four, it is averaging more than 4.5 shots and claimed 37 bogeys and 10 double bogeys on Friday. \n     \"That was one of the best rounds I have had at Augusta in terms of ball striking, but I finish disappointed because I left shots on the course,\" said Poulter.\n     \"I three-putted at 10 and at 14. I know I am playing well, my scores are not reflecting that but they are coming and I need to stay patient.\"\n     Elsewhere, Northern Ireland's \n     \n    conceded \"Augusta is still a work in progress\" for him after missing the cut along with England's \n     \n ", "subject": "Sports", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/26999620", "title": ["Masters 2014: Rory McIlroy makes cut with putt on 18th hole"]},

{"article": "    There is a standard protocol now when watching Mo Farah in big races: let him pick his way through the early skirmishes, wait for him to seize the lead just before the bell and then roar him home as the world's best distance runners flap and flutter in his slipstream.\n     Six times in the last two and a half years Farah has won gold in that fashion, from Korea to Moscow and, most memorably of all, in Stratford's Olympic Stadium. Which will make it all the more unsettling for some to learn that, on his return to the capital for \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     he will be running as a novice.\n     You can forecast a man's 5,000m chances in big championships on his performance in the heats. You can gauge his 10,000m hopes on precedent and form. \n     The marathon? A long, purgatorial run into virgin territory. \n     There is no precedent. There is no science to predict what might happen. Farah has run 26.2 miles in training. But he has never covered it at race pace, on asphalt, with rivals pushing and breaking, the course twisting and climbing, emergency sirens wailing from muscle, joint and lung.\n      \n    Dennis Kimetto (Ken) - Berlin 2012 \n      \n    Ayele Abshero (Eth) -  Dubai 2012 \n      \n    Tsegaye Mekonnen (Eth) - Dubai 2014 \n      \n    Lelisa Desisa (Eth) - Dubai 2013 \n      \n    Bernard Koech (Ken) - Dubai 2013 \n      \n    Kenenisa Bekele (Eth, above) - Paris 2014 \n     And that, for a nation grown accustomed to his peerless track triumphs, may take some getting used to.\n     \"It's inevitable with everything Mo has achieved so far that people are going to expect that he wins it,\" says Paula Radcliffe, the \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and Farah's friend and advisor since his schooldays in Hounslow.\n     \"He could have a really good run and not win it. It doesn't mean he's run badly, but trying to convey that to other people is difficult because he has done so much. He has achieved so much that people expect every time he steps out he's going to win.\"\n     Last weekend the only other man to pull off the world and Olympic distance double-double, Kenenisa Bekele, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     in Paris.\n     That was in a race where he was untroubled by rivals or their tactics. In contrast to that tailor-made itinerary, Farah has chosen to make his own bow on the most public stage of all, against the best field London has ever assembled.\n     There is \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     There is world-record holder Wilson Kipsang, and course record holder Emmanuel Mutai, and Olympic and world champion Stephen Kiprotich. There will be no hiding place, no respite, no easy ride. \n Farah has a close affinity with the London Marathon\r\n       Farah understands the dimensions of his task. Ever since he moved from student digs in St Mary's in Twickenham to a shared house with Kenya's distance elite back in 2004, spending his evenings watching old VHS cassettes of track greats and marathon classics, he has been the most willing student of his specialised subject.\n     But even as his body language at his pre-race media interviews appeared bashful - half-sentences, shy grins, lean limbs hidden under baggy grey tracksuit bottoms and an over-sized white T-shirt - his mood was bullish.\n     \"I've gone straight in the deep end, but that's what champions do. London is by far the toughest field anyone has seen. It makes me more of a champion for going out there and going straight in.\"\n     Farah's ascent to the elite is intimately entwined with this race. Three times as a teenager he won the mini-marathon, the three-mile race for kids aged from 11-17 that precedes the main event at its Mall finish; after leaving school in 2001, it was a London Marathon scholarship that paid for him to join the newly established endurance performance centre at St Mary's rather than join the army, as he feared he would have to.\n     In making his debut this year he is being richly rewarded. Yet he is also paying something back, revitalising interest in the elite side of the race for a public that haven't been drawn to it with as much curiosity since Radcliffe's record-breaking deeds a decade ago. \n     Outside of hardcore athletics fans, most people have grown to think of the London Marathon as friends and fancy dress rather than unmissable sporting drama.\n     The uncertainty about his performance only multiplies the fascination. How fast can he go? What would constitute success?\n      \n     Emmanuel Mutai (Ken) - 2011\n      \n     Wilson Kipsang (Ken) - 2012\n      \n     Sammy Wanjiru (Ken) - 2009\n      \n     Martin Lel (Ken) - 2008\n      \n     Tsegaye Kebede (Eth) - 2010\n     It is notoriously difficult to compare marathons run on different days on different courses, so Bekele's two hours, five minutes and three seconds in Paris may provide only limited guidance; while it is worth noting that the Ethiopian's bests over 5,000m and 10,000m are 16 and 29 seconds faster than Farah's, those PBs were set a long time ago, and the pair were only separated by hundredths of a second over the half-marathon distance of the Great North Run last September.\n     The man whose distance records Bekele beat, Haile Gebrselassie, ran 2:06:35 on his own London debut in 2002, at the time the fastest debut in history. His great track rival Paul Tergat had clocked 2.08:15 in London the year before. \n     Neither do those two provide a perfect prediction for Farah this Sunday, but they do offer context: Farah could run brilliantly, beat the great Haile's debut and yet still finish fourth.\n     What gives those close to him such confidence - there were whispers this week that he is in shape to dip under 2:05 with benevolent weather and a little luck - is that he comes to London off the same formula that has made him the preeminent track runner of his era.\n     Farah is no longer the callow, talented yet capricious kid who struggled to convert his ability into major medals in the early part of his career. He is in supreme physical shape, the product of his usual winter at altitude in Iten, Kenya, with the solid self-belief of a multiple champion to match.\n     In coach Alberto Salazar he has a man who knows more about marathon training than anyone else in the world. Just as importantly, Farah, after the unparalleled success the pair have enjoyed together since 2011, takes confidence in everything he advises.\n     While this is 40,000 steps into the unknown, it is no wild punt. With no World Championships or Olympics this year, Farah can test himself over the ultimate challenge without jeopardising his track status or future goals.\n     Wilson Kipsang (Ken) \n     \n    - Berlin, 2013\n     Patrick Makau (Ken) \n     \n     - Berlin, 2011\n     Dennis Kimetto (Ken) \n     \n     - Chicago, 2013\n     Emmanuel Mutai (Ken) \n     \n     - Chicago, 2013\n     Haile Gebrselassie (Eth)\n     \n     - Berlin, 2008\n     If it works, he may think about a 10,000m/marathon double at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, just as Salazar hinted to me that he would in the aftermath of 2012. If it fails, he can return to the track in time to keep his speed over the shorter stuff. \n     \"With a marathon, it is about racing, to see how you cope with the distance and how your body copes with it,\" says Radcliffe, who has no fears that Farah's springy track style might not convert to the heavy demands of the road.\n     \"It is refreshing for him to have a new and different challenge. He'll probably still be successful on the track, if not more successful than he has been, with the marathon training behind him, but this gives him a chance to do something a little bit different. Yes, it's challenging, but I think he will be relishing the fact that it is a new stimulus for him.\"\n     Gebrselassie will be back on London's streets on Sunday as the elite field's pacemaker, driving them along at close to record pace over the first 30km (18.5 miles). Farah, who will run without a watch (\"I'll just go with the feeling\"), will want to conserve as much energy as he can in that time, for once letting other athletes dictate, staying safe until at least 18 miles and the multiple assaults that will surely follow.\n     \"In the marathon you really do have to run your own race,\" says Radcliffe, 11 years on from setting her own unsurpassed world record of 2:15.25 on the same course. \n     \"You have to cover moves and be aware of what others are doing, but you also have to do what's right for your body and do what suits you best. And that's tricky when you haven't run one before.\"\n     Farah already has the British records at 1500m, 5,000m and 10,000m. The 29-year-old marathon mark of Steve Jones (2:07:13) is realistically in sight this weekend. Beyond that the boundaries are less certain.

{"article": "    Dundee United secured a Scottish Cup final place with an opportunist, but ultimately comfortable, victory over Rangers.\n     Stuart Armstrong finished decisively for the opening goal, which came after the Ibrox side spurned a clear chance.\n     Gary Mackay-Steven's second came via a deflection and the Rangers goalkeeper Steve Simonsen made an error for Nadir Ciftci's third.\n     The Ibrox side had made it 2-1 with a first-half Steven Smith free-kick.\n     But they were unable to truly threaten United's passage to a final meeting with \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     on 17 May.\n     Whoever Jackie McNamara's side face, the occasion is likely to lack the relentless intensity of this contest.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Interview - Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara     The game initially had to accept second billing, since the competition was between the two sets of supporters and their goading of each other. The noise spilled from the Ibrox stands as if oblivious to events on the pitch.\n     There was soon a hectic urgency to the play, though, and composure was an early victim of the heightened atmosphere. There were pent-up emotions to be released, and the quality of the game suffered from the raucous surroundings.\n     There was excitement and zeal as the two sets of players hared around the Ibrox pitch, but not enough self-control to bring some poise to the proceedings. \n     Rangers had the most cause to rue that lack of restraint, since they should have opened the scoring when Dean Shiels was sent through on goal. The forward hurried his finish, though, and scuffed the ball wide.\n     It became a galling miss for Rangers, because minutes later a hopeful Gavin Gunning header sent Armstrong clear. \n     Nadir Ciftci was returning from an offside position but was deemed not to be interfering with play and Armstrong took advantage of the confusion to clip a shot past Simonsen that kissed a post before nestling in the net. \n     A pattern was established, since Rangers had the better patches of play, but could not influence the outcome.\n Armstrong (left) beat the offside trap to put United ahead\r\n       When Fraser Aird was free in the area, he laid the ball back to Jon Daly, only for the striker to direct a shot rashly over the bar.\n     Moments later, Richard Foster failed to clear his lines and allowed Ryan Gauld to burrow into the Rangers penalty area before shunting into the path of Armstrong. He could not connect cleanly and neither, subsequently, could Mackay-Steven, but the ball looped off Bilel Mohsni, over Simonsen, and into the net.\n     Smith restored some hope for Rangers with a free-kick that squeezed between Radoslaw Cierzniak and the base of his left-hand post. \n     That goal came just before half-time and, athough Rangers continued to enjoy greater possession after the interval, their frailties could not be disguised.\n     Mohsni was often hapless in possession, attacks were intermittent and haphazard in nature, and there was not enough link-up play between the midfield and the forwards.\n     United's midfield struggled to retain possession, and their defence often sat too deep, but their four front players were a constant threat, not least because of the calamities that the Rangers defence were capable of.\n     When Foster broke up one move and passed back to Simonsen, the goalkeeper hesitated before stubbing the ball straight at Ciftci. The striker rounded the stricken goalkeeper and was celebrating even before he rolled the ball into the empty net.\n     Rangers restored something of their reputation with this display, but United were the more clinical side.\n           Match ends, Rangers 1, Dundee United 3.

They are given guidance as to what they should do for disabled supporters and how many spaces they should provide but this isn't being followed.\n     \"The problem is that the clubs aren't being made to follow it, and neither the FA nor the Premier League has any rules telling them what the minimum standard should be. As a result, the experience of a disabled fan varies greatly from ground to ground.\n     \"Football showed in the wake of Hillsborough and the move to all-seater stadiums that it is capable of drastic action.  However, until clubs are forced to follow these guidelines, wide-scale change in this case appears unlikely.\"\n     Penning said a complete overhaul of grounds was required, \"starting at the very top\".\n     He added: \"The situation is currently woefully inadequate and it is not only wheelchair access that falls short, but access for people with all kinds of impairments.\"\n     Guidelines on how football clubs in the UK should cater for disabled spectators have been in place since 2004. \n     The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     sets out minimum standards that all new grounds have to meet in the provision, location, and quality of facilities for disabled fans. The number of wheelchair spaces a stadium should provide is based on its capacity. \n     Since the implementation of the Equality Act in 2010, and legislation dating back to 1995, it has been illegal for service providers, including football clubs, to treat disabled people less favourably than other customers.\n     Clubs can be ordered to make reasonable adjustments, which can include providing induction loops for those with hearing impairments, audio-description facilities for those with sight impairments and free tickets for carers who accompany disabled fans at games.\n     The Premier League insist they are following the existing regulations, and said: \"The Accessible Stadia Guide sets out agreed standards to be achieved when new grounds are designed or existing grounds rebuilt, however all clubs use those standards to assess existing provisions and guide them on how to make improvements.\n     \"Particular attention is given to achieving stadium management solutions that make the best of the constraints and opportunities inherent in each stadium. This includes working with the fans to arrive at solutions that work for them, and providing special training for stewards and staff to ensure that appropriate assistance is given.\" \n     Joyce Cook, chair of \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     formerly known as the National Association of Disabled Supporters, added: \"The experience of disabled football fans varies across the country.

{"article": "    For a brief moment in Munich, Manchester United dared to dream. \n     As it was, that hope was gone in 60 seconds of Patrice Evra's goal \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     They are seventh in the Premier League, seven points off the Champions League places. Realistically they will not make the top four so they must now wait until September 2015, at the earliest, before they are back in a competition that has become part of the furniture at Old Trafford. \n \r\n\t\t Manchester United are by far the most profitable football club in the world \r\n\t     It has been 19 years since United were last on the outside looking in. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers took the one English place. \n     Manchester United is a club that knows all about comebacks and about overcoming adversity, but there is much for David Moyes and his board to ponder as they prepare for a summer of rebuilding.\n     There is a belief within United's corridors of power that life without the Champions League will be a one-off. Liverpool thought the same when they dropped out in 2009-10, after five consecutive seasons. Four years on, they are only just on the brink of a return having finished seventh last season. \n     United finished 38 points ahead of Liverpool last season, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     - a swing of 55 points in 11 months. United will hope it is not a sign of things to come.\n     The plan of United's executive vice-chairman Edward Woodward and owners the Glazer family remains for Moyes to oversee an overhaul of the playing squad this summer. His transfer budget will be significant. \n     Key targets include Borussia Dortmund forward Marco Reus, and midfielders Toni Kroos from Bayern and Atletico Madrid's Koke. But will those players be prepared to sacrifice Champions League football to join United? \n     Many say not. \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Each of their 'superstar' targets have been sounded out and United have been given encouragement. The problem may come if clubs with Champions League qualification join the bidding and are willing to match the financial packages on offer at Old Trafford. \n Can United persuade the likes of Bayern's Kroos to live without Champions League football next season?\r\n       The Southampton pair of Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana are targets for Moyes. Both will be offered the chance to join the start of a new era at United. That is how United are selling themselves. But that is only half the battle. \n     When Manchester City were trying to break into the top four, they were forced to outbid their rivals and offer more in wages than the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and United themselves. City blew Chelsea out of the water to sign Robinho, offering the Brazilian \u00a3160,000 a week. \n     They paid \u00a390,000 per week to Wayne Bridge and, a few weeks after finishing fifth in the Premier League, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     to leave Barcelona. But then City were viewed as a club that was going places. Can United say the same?\n     Football agent Barry Silkman said: \"Manchester United is an incredible club, but things do change in football and I believe they will struggle to attract the very highest calibre of player. The only way to do it, is to pay big money. \n     \"It worked for Manchester City to a degree but they have paid massive salaries, and transfer fees that have been way over the top. They had no option, but United have to think of Financial Fair Play. They'll do well to finish in the top four next season.\"\n     There is also, of course, the question of keeping their very best players. \n     United are a financial superpower in football terms. They have pushed boundaries in the commercial world and boast no fewer than 35 individual sponsors, including an official noodle partner for Asia, Oceania and the Middle East, as well as 11 telecommunications partners around the world. \n Financially United are able to cope with a one-season absence from the Champions League, say experts\r\n       \"Manchester United are unique,\" said Christian Purslow, the former Liverpool managing director. \"They are by far the most profitable football club in the world. Their total profits this year, a difficult year, are still expected to be some \u00a3130m. Nobody is in a better position financially to withstand being out of the Champions League for a season. \n     \"I don't think sponsors would want to see United out of the Champions League for a long time. I don't think those sponsors will want to live with it for beyond a year and I expect United have not the slightest intention of allowing that to happen. Which is why I expect them to be incredibly active in this summer's transfer market.\"\n     United have been in talks with Nike for the past 12 months about renewing their record \u00a324m-a-year kit deal. United have not been prepared to countenance allowing Nike to get a cut-price deal, and nor do Nike expect to negotiate one.\n     In recent weeks, officials from Nike have been in meetings with United and have passed officials from Adidas on their way in as the Old Trafford club search out the best deal. The message is clear, that United remain in demand. \n     The timing of their world record \u00a353m per season \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     could not have been better when it was agreed 12 months ago. It will be unaffected by the club's absence from the Champions League when it begins next season. \n     Nor will United's eight-year contract with Aon, which is worth at least \u00a3180m to sponsor the club's training ground and training kit. The numbers are astonishing. \n     The impact on sponsors may take time to pinch, but a more immediate concern will be the loss of Champions League prize money, TV revenue and gate receipts. \n     Last season, United made \u00a331.3m from Champions League broadcasting money. Prize money came on top of that. Uefa pays around \u00a3800,000 for each Champions League win, a draw earns you \u00a3415,000. Prize money can be substantial - Chelsea took home \u00a348m from Uefa when they won in 2012. \n     Dan Jones, a partner in Deloitte's sports business group, said: \"There is certainly no need for United to panic. They are still signing up sponsors and I'd suggest that most of their major deals are not dependent on them being in the Champions League. \n     \"That means the only real loss they will feel comes from Champions League TV revenue, prize money and perhaps the lost gate receipts from home matches they might have staged. Some of that may be mitigated by Europa League qualification and, possibly, built-in savings in player contracts. All that adds up to around \u00a340-50m - only about 10% of their expected total revenue.\" \n     Senior figures at United would like to qualify for the Europa League, despite the logistical difficulties. Were United to win the Europa League in 2014-15, they would earn \u00a310m from Uefa.\n     That is a question no-one can answer with certainty. United officials will tell you one season and one season only. Those at Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and even Everton may also go into the new season with that in mind. \n     And with a new bumper Champions League deal to come in within the next 12 months, the prize has never been greater. \"For many years, it was a formality that the big four [United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool] would be in the Champions League,\" Purslow added.\n     \"That made running these clubs, in terms of their expected income and their wage spending, relatively simple. But the emergence of Manchester City changed the Premier League forever. \n Sir Alex Ferguson took United into the Champions League 19 years in a row and won it twice \r\n       \"Five massive clubs going for four Champions League places doesn't go. That is causing intense competition both on the field and off the field in the commercial marketplace, and that will only intensify. \n     \"Missing out on the Champions League this year represents \u00a330m in missed TV revenue for United - in 12 months' time, when the new Champions League TV deal kicks in, the cost of missing out will double. None of those five want to be on the wrong side of that.\"\n     Sir Alex Ferguson built the United empire as the game of football became a global business. That financial might will shelter Moyes for one season without Champions League football. United officials may not look so kindly on a second season without that prize.\n ", "subject": "Sports", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26981223", "title": ["Manchester United count cost of Champions League exit"]},

Nine times out of 10 the race is much easier than your longest training run. You're rested, you're fresher and you have the support of the crowd, use their energy.\n     \"Have an idea of what time you want to do but if you're feeling better than expected, throw that out of the window, and, equally, if you're feeling rough, stop looking at the clock and concentrate on completing the race.\"\n      \n     \"Last year I was asked what kept me going and I replied by saying \n    \r\n  \r\n\n    ' I was joking, of course. \n     \"I run in an orange bib and on the back it says 'oldest marathon runner' so when I'm walking along I get a tap on the shoulder from people asking me how old I am.

Great journeys are made with small steps.\"\n      \n     \"It's tough going from a team event like rowing, where everybody knows when you're not giving 100%, to an individual event where it's only you who knows if you're not giving 100%.\n     \"You know the pain will hit you at some point and it's down to you how much you're prepared to give. \n     \"I usually take a pair of headphones with me, but not to listen to music, it's just so that nobody talks to me.

{"article": "    In his regular BBC Sport tactics column, Robbie Savage looks at \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Both teams are attack-minded and high-scoring with exciting forward players, and both have weaknesses in defence, despite City's recent improvement at the back.\n     So the battle for control of the game in midfield will be vital at Anfield, particularly how each team tries to protect their back four.\n Signing of the season? Fernandinho joined City from Shakhtar Donetsk for \u00a330m in the summer of 2013\r\n       For Manchester City, Fernandinho is seen as their main defensive midfielder, but there is much more to his game than that.\n     His energy will be vital for Manuel Pellegrini's men, not just when it comes down to winning the ball back from Liverpool, but also in turning defence into attack.\n     I sometimes hear people describe Fernandinho as being an anchor man in the mould of former Chelsea star Claude Makelele, because they think Yaya Toure is the City midfielder who gets forward.\n     But in fact Fernandinho and Toure work in tandem as a pair of box-to-box players. They have got a great partnership because they share defensive and attacking responsibilities in City's usual 4-2-3-1 formation.\n     It is Toure who grabs the headlines because of his rampaging runs but Fernandinho is an unsung hero for City because of the energy he brings to their team, his mobility, and the amount of work he puts in.\n     Defensively, Fernandinho covers a lot of ground when City do not have possession and puts the most pressure on the ball. If you add up interceptions and tackles, he has won it back more than any other City player this season.\n Stats: Opta 1. Fernandinho (58) 1. Yaya Toure (177) 2. Martin Demichelis (47) 2. Fernandinho (155) 3. Pablo Zabaleta (45) 3. Vincent Kompany (111)     In contrast to Steven Gerrard, who does play the holding role for Liverpool, Fernandinho does not just turn over possession by sitting in front of his defence. Instead, he goes hunting for the ball.\n     In the past, Gerrard would have covered the same amount of ground as the 28-year-old Brazilian - who chases teams down, often high up the pitch - but these days he stays much deeper, apart from at set-pieces.\n     Like City, Liverpool look to get lots of players forward quickly when they win the ball but, on Sunday, Gerrard will not be one of them. He only enters the final third for set-pieces, from which he has provided seven of his nine assists and his three goals that have not come from the penalty spot. \n     It is different for Toure and Fernandinho. When you play with two box-to-box men in the middle like City do, they have to be disciplined. When one goes forward, the other has to stay - even if they probably both want to go.\n     Getting that balance right at Anfield will be vital for City and not just because of the different threats Liverpool pose.\n     Fernandinho and Toure will have to help their defence deal with the Reds' fast forwards when they break, watch for their overlapping full-backs and also put pressure on Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho, who will be looking to ping longer balls over and through City's back-line.\n Stats: Opta Games & Minutes 26 & 2,220 29 & 2,450 Goals/Shots 4/22 13/40 (10 pens) Assists 3 9 Chances created 31 57 Passes (% completed) 1,394 (88%) 1,832 (86%) Tackles (% won) 78 (78%) 79 (71%)     The City pairing have attacking responsibilities, too. Toure's main threat is through his trademark runs forward and shots from distance. Fernandinho is less spectacular but he is fast, good on the ball, able to pick out a pass and can burst into the box to get on the end of moves as well.\n     The most crucial thing about Fernandinho, though, is that the high-tempo he helps to set allows City to launch fast attacks of their own.\n     \r\n  \r\n\n     but the same could be said about Fernandinho for City.\n Stats: Opta Games 26 5 29 4 Wins 21 1 21 2 Defeats 3 2 3 2 Goals for 80 4 80 10 Av. goals for 3.08 0.8 2.75 2.5 Win % 81% 20% 72% 50% Points per game 2.5 1 2.3 1.5     When City win the ball and go forward, they move it about quickly, sometimes taking only one touch to lay it into the path of a team-mate and breaking into the box at devastating speed.\n     Fernandinho does not try to play searching long passes forward like Gerrard does. Instead, his job when he gets the ball back is to quickly push forward himself or immediately give it to a player ahead of him - David Silva or Samir Nasri, or one of City's overlapping full-backs.\n     That is what they will try to do against Liverpool, and City do not always attack at the same breathtaking speed when Fernandinho is not there - \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Martin Demichelis was in midfield and he took too many touches, which slowed City down.\n     City have failed to score in four of the five league games that Fernandinho has missed this season. They are the only times they have not found the net this season.\n     One of the factors behind Liverpool's success this season has been \n    \r\n  \r\n\n      and how he mixes up his midfield and attack depending on the opposition.\n     We got an idea of what to expect at Anfield \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     They went 1-0 up but lost 2-1 despite having enough chances to win the game, with their worst miss coming when Raheem Sterling skied his shot when he was clean through.\n     Liverpool played a 4-3-3 formation that day. But they did not have Daniel Sturridge or Gerrard, who were both injured. City, who were without Sergio Aguero, lined up in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Alvaro Negredo as their lone striker.\n     Luis Suarez played as Liverpool's central striker, with Coutinho on the left and Sterling on the right. Lucas Leiva played in the holding midfield role, staying very deep just like Gerrard does.\n     This time, I think Rodgers will go 4-3-3 again, but with Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling across the front three, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     That means Coutinho will be in the team but playing much deeper than he did on Boxing Day.\n     Again, just as in that Spurs game, where Sterling and Glen Johnson went at Tottenham left-back Danny Rose, I think Liverpool will target the left side of City's defence.\n     Whether it is Gael Clichy or Aleksandar Kolarov at left-back, and Martin Demichelis or Joleon Lescott as City's left-sided centre-back, that side is far weaker than Kompany and Pablo Zabaleta on the right.\n     Because of the pace of the Liverpool attack, I think City should go with their faster defenders to deal with it - Clichy and Lescott rather than Kolarov and Demichelis.\n     It is a big call for Pellegrini, but he has stuck with Demichelis until now, and probably will again. Whoever he goes for alongside Kompany, it is a gamble.\n     City are used to starting games on the front foot but their defence will have to be ready for a fast start by Liverpool on Sunday. \n     Time and time again this season, particularly at Anfield, Liverpool have over-run lots of teams early on in games. \n     They have scored in the first half in 31 of their 33 league games so far, and have hit a total of 54 first-half goals, by far the most of any top-flight team.\n 1. Liverpool - 54 1. Chelsea - 9 2. Man City - 37 2. Man City - 10 3. Chelsea - 28 3. Everton - 12 Liverpool have played two more games than City 1. Liverpool - 31 1. = Chelsea/Everton - 24 2. Man City - 22 3. Arsenal - 22 3. Chelsea - 18 4. = Man City/C Palace/Hull - 21     City are also a high-scoring, attacking team. Both they and Liverpool have a chance of beating Chelsea's record from 2009-10 of 103 goals in a Premier League campaign.\n Liverpool have played two more games than City Liverpool 455 (1) 227 (1) 19.78% (2) 90 (1) Man City 420 (3) 195 (3) 20% (1) 84 (2)     Their strength is going forward, but City have improved defensively in recent months, and have conceded only four goals in their last nine Premier League games, compared to 25 in their previous 22 league matches. \n     There are plenty of reasons they will be confident of surviving any early onslaught at Anfield. Pellegrini's side have conceded the first goal only five times in their 31 Premier League games, and only four first-half goals in 16 league games away from home. Only Chelsea have conceded fewer first-half goals in total.\n     Part of that comes down to the way City impose themselves on games rather than their ability to hold out under pressure, but they can defend when they have to.\n Liverpool have played two more games than City Liverpool 424 (11th best) 130 (6th best) 40 (7th best) 10 (=10th best) Man City 307 (1st best) 106 (2nd best) 29 (2nd best) 13 (=2nd best)     They will have to be solid at Anfield. The strength of Liverpool's attack means this will be City's biggest defensive test in the league this season. Any lapses will be punished.\n     Even without any individual errors, the Reds front three is good enough to find a way through City's back four, so the protection offered by Fernandinho and Toure in front of them will be crucial. They cannot leave their defence exposed at any time.\n     I would expect an open game, where both teams have spells where they are on top and both teams create lots of chances. Just like at Etihad Stadium, who wins will come down to which team can take theirs.\n      \n ", "subject": "Sports", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26958903", "title": ["Liverpool v Man City: Unsung hero Fernandinho can be key for City"]},
{"article": "    In Britain, Argentine Diego Simeone is best remembered as the man whose reaction to a petulant kick by David Beckham resulted in the England star famously being sent off during a World Cup game in 1998.\n     That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). \n Simeone was on the receiving end of Beckham's infamous kick in 1998\r\n       And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days.\n     If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\"\n     Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff.\n     Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real.\n     To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. \n     Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles.\n     The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes.\n     Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football.\n     For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. \n     In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer.\n     That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks.\n     That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. \n Atletico are unbeaten against Barcelona in five matches this season and meet on the final day of the La Liga campaign\r\n       Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack.\n     As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. \n     Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable.\n     More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head.\n     For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up.\n     That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster.\n Simeone credited the Atletico fans with inspiring his team to victory in the Champions League\r\n       Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort.\n     When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour.\n Head to head and not goal difference decides teams level on points. Atletico have better record than Real, and yet to play Barcelona twice 79 78 76     As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. \n     But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility.\n     Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\"\n     Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be. \n ", "subject": "Sports", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26966304", "title": ["Atletico Madrid: Diego Simeone's side are stern test for Chelsea"]},

{"article": "    Augusta. The Masters. Three words to make golf fans drool every April. \n     This hallowed corner of an unremarkable Georgia town is one of sport's most famous settings, the tournament one of the world's most unique events. Here are 18 reasons why we love the Masters.\n     Ah, Augusta. Just the name evokes an iconic image in green, punctuated by explosions of colour from banks of azaleas and framed by towering pines, with grass so sumptuous you could make a suit out of it. \n     Driving up the adjacent Washington Road strip, with its bars, burger joints, motels, parking lots and neon plantations, you would struggle to believe such treasure could lie over the fence. \"It's like being in the most perfect picture that has ever been painted,\" said England's Ian Poulter.\n     Think genteel country club rather than brash sports venue. The smart but humble 19th century plantation-style clubhouse at the end of Magnolia Lane sets the tone for this spring rite. The visual splendour, the traditions and history, the reverence of the spectators and Augusta's limited-numbers policy add to the occasion. \"It's a very interesting place and has a wonderful feel. I still love it after 40-odd years,\" says veteran BBC golf broadcaster Peter Alliss.\n     It's Augusta's way or the highway, but the rules - strictly enforced with Southern charm - add to the ambience. Broadcasters and the media are also expected to toe the line. Fans are to be known as \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and controversy is to be avoided. The no-running rule does at least provide the morning spectacle of speed-walkers scuttling off to all parts to place chairs. Phones are also a no-no, as is sleeping on the course. \"I always marvel at how they control all those people with a bit of string. Possibly some trepidation at putting a foot wrong,\" notes Alliss.\n     Stay on the right side of the law and the Masters will treat you well. Sandwiches, including the traditional Pimento Cheese, cost between $1.50 and $3 and domestic beer, in Masters-logoed plastic cups you can take home, is $3. Fancy foreign stuff is $4. Despite an image rooted in tradition, the Augusta National is always looking to refine and innovate, such as the state-of-the-art digital coverage. Southern splendour with a modern agenda.\n     As the only major at the same venue every year, each triumph and disaster adds another layer to the legend. The National was opened in 1933 on the site of an old plant nursery, and the first Masters - then called the \"Invitational\" - was staged the following year. Traditions abound, such as the Champions Dinner, ceremonial starters, the par-three contest or amateurs bunking down in the Crow's Nest above the clubhouse.  Landmarks also become old friends. The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     because of damage was news around the world.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Archive - Nick Faldo helps 1991 winner Ian Woosnam slip into his Green Jacket      The tropical-weight emerald blazer might not be to everyone's taste, but it is one of golf's most coveted accolades. The jacket was first introduced for members in 1937 and ordered from Brooks Uniform Company in New York. \n     Sam Snead was the first winner to receive a jacket and honorary membership in 1949. The reigning Masters champion can take it home for a year, then it must be kept at the club. The jacket comes with a two-page list of rules, according to last year's winner Adam Scott.\n     A Masters badge feels like Willy Wonka's golden ticket to most but the lucky few (well, roughly 30,000 a day on practice days, half that during the tournament) get one of the best views in sport. Augusta's seat-saving etiquette is unique. Plonk your green fold-up chair anywhere outside the ropes and return hours later to reclaim your spot. It will be empty and waiting. \n Patrons arrange chairs around Amen Corner during the second round of the 2013 Masters\r\n       The Tuesday evening shindig for past champions is one of sport's most exclusive clubs. The elite few dine off a menu dreamed up by last year's winner. \n     Tradition dictates they opt for dishes from their homeland, throwing up some mouthwatering delicacies over the years such as Sandy Lyle's \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and Charl Schwartzel's monkey gland sauce. \n     Arnie, Jack and co. can order off the clubhouse menu if they're not game for a bush tucker trial. Australia's Scott will serve \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     a surf 'n' turf BBQ and his mum's pavlova. \"I didn't feel I could serve kangaroo or crocodile to these guys.\" \n     Kids, wags and celebs don the caddie's traditional white boiler suit for the traditional Wednesday afternoon laugh-fest over the picturesque par-three course. \n Rory McIlroy had fiancee Caroline Wozniacki on his bag during last year's par-three event\r\n       The family fun, back-slapping and bonhomie act as a release valve before the main event. \n     But there is mischief at work on the banks of Ike's Pond - the Curse of the Par Three. In its 53-year existence, no par-three champion has ever won the Masters in the same year.\n      \n     White Dogwood, 505 yards, par 4.  \n      \n     Golden Bell, 155 yards, par 3.\n      \n     Azalea, 510 yards, par 5. \n     Golf's most iconic stretch of holes, visually stunning and technically demanding, Amen Corner can be a round-wrecker or a springboard for a back-nine charge. \n     The term \"Amen Corner\" was coined by sportswriter Herbert Warren Wind in 1958 for the area down at the lowest part of the course: the 11th, 12th and tee shot on 13. \n     The par-four 11th is the second most difficult hole on the course, after the 10th, followed by the short 12th across Rae's Creek where the wind swirls and makes club selection so difficult. Tom Weiskopf holds the record with a 13 there, in 1980. \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     says three-time champion Gary Player. \"Amen Corner - what an appropriate name.\"\n     If leaves and branches could talk, these boughs would have thousands of stories to tell. The old oak - or actually two oaks, one smaller one next to the main tree - on the course side of the clubhouse is the hub of Masters week. \n     All golf's movers, shakers and hangers-on will be found lurking in its shade, interviewing players, doing business deals, gossiping, being seen. \n     Everyone's guilty of \"fomo\" (fear of missing out) as eyes dart and heads swivel, trying to spot someone more important to talk to. 'Meet you under the tree' is a traditional Masters refrain for those with the right badge.\n Caddies with Mike Weir, Garrick Porteous and Jason Day on Hogan's Bridge on the 12th hole in practice \r\n       That ice-white boiler suit is quintessential Augusta. Before 1983, staff caddies were assigned to Masters players. All were black, and many went by nicknames such as Fireball, Ironman and Cemetery. After 1983, players were allowed to bring their own caddies but they still had to wear the traditional white jump suit. \n     Two-time champion Ben Crenshaw's long-time Masters caddie Carl Jackson is one of the remaining old school Augusta bagmen, who began working at the course aged 14 in 1961. He will work a record 53rd Masters this year. \"That suit is pretty thick so you can get really hot. At least you can pack light - a couple of pairs of shorts and some T-shirts to wear under it,\" said Martin Kaymer's caddie Craig Connelly.\n     An icon in white, the modest manor belies is status as the home of the Green Jackets. Built in 1854 by the owner of the then indigo plantation, it stands sentinel at the highest point of the course. \n     The front door, at the end of Magnolia Lane, opens onto a short hallway with a reception desk and offices. Twenty odd paces take you through a lounge, housing the Masters trophy, to the back door and the course. A spiral staircase leads to the library, an informal dining room with additional seating on the veranda. The Champions Locker room - officially the Masters Club Room - is to the rear. \"The clubhouse has grown over the years but it is still attractive and comfortable, not glitzy at all,\" said Alliss.\n     Another tradition adding to Masters lore, wide-eyed amateurs are invited to stay, for a modest (and undisclosed) sum, in the eaves of the clubhouse during Masters week. The five-room dormitory is reached from the library via an unmarked door which leads into a small hallway. \n     On one side there is another door to the Champions Locker Room. Plenty of young men have stumbled, accidentally or otherwise, into the exclusive domain of Masters winners. Opposite, behind another non-descript door, is the steep staircase to the Crow's Nest and its unmistakeable glass cupola.\n     Among former residents to have won the Masters are Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods. Tales of 'Nesters' abound - one has Nicklaus getting reprimanded for abusing the club's hospitality by having two steaks a night as a 19-year-old in 1959.\n     The most exclusive place in this most exclusive of clubs, the domain of the few is another Masters mystique. Behind a door marked \"Masters Club Room - private\", past champions get to change, eat, gossip and gripe in seclusion. Twenty-eight oak lockers with brass nameplates line the room, with two players to a locker. Adam Scott shares with Gary Player. \"Gary gets a lot of mail so there's not much room for my stuff,\" says new incumbent Scott. \n     If the visual splendour and waft of pine and cut grass isn't enough of an assault on the senses, the Masters keeps your ears busy too. The roars greeting great shots reverberate around the pines, which act like the reeds in a giant mouth organ, especially on the lower parts of the back nine where the noise is coralled.\n Phil Mickelson is a three-time Masters winner and hugely popular with the Augusta crowds\r\n       A Sunday roar has a deeper, more urgent resonance than a Thursday roar. And a Woods or Mickelson roar tops the lot. \"To feel that energy and to hear the roars and be a part of what's happening that final nine holes, it's the greatest experience for a professional golfer,\" says 'Lefty'. \n     The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     reads like a who's who of golf and reinforces its status. Jack Nicklaus tops the pile with six wins followed by Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods on four. Phil Mickelson, Nick Faldo, Gary Player, Sam Snead and Jimmy Demaret are on three each. This week marks the 25th anniversary of Faldo's first win. His third victory in 1996 is still the last by a player from Britain and Ireland.

{"article": "    As Liverpool prepares to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough, manager Brendan Rodgers is using \"the 96 in the sky\" as inspiration to deliver the honour Anfield treasures most.\n     Liverpool's last league title came in 1990, a year after Hillsborough - and those who died at the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest will be remembered at an emotional Anfield when the club meet Manchester City on Sunday.\n     The game, a possible title decider, will have \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     with a 13:37 BST kick-off, seven minutes later than usual to recall the period when Liverpool's game with Forest was stopped because of events unfolding on the Leppings Lane terrace at the home of Sheffield Wednesday.\n \r\n\t\t One lad looked me in the eye and said: 'Al, there are people dying in there' \r\n\t     \r\n  \r\n\n     as the Hillsborough families hope for closure after 25 years and Liverpool will be hoping to offer further footballing comfort by finally returning to the top of the domestic game.\n     Former Reds captain Alan Hansen, who was part of Liverpool's side that day, tells BBC Sport: \"It would be a tremendous thing for Liverpool to win the title on the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough and 24 years after they last won it, but every family will be different.\n     \"Justice and closure is the most important thing for the families and I feel 100% compassion for them. Liverpool winning the league would come a long way second or third in that process, although of course as fans they would love to see the club enjoy such success.\n     \"It would be great for Liverpool, Liverpool supporters and the Hillsborough families for Liverpool to win the title but that would not be the most important thing for them.\"\n     Hansen was playing his first game of the season at Hillsborough because of injury, and the memories of the day and the aftermath are still raw and recalled with emotion.\n     \"Whenever Hillsborough is brought up at any time, whether people talk about it, it is on the news or about how the fight of the families goes on, right away you start reflecting,\" says Hansen.\n A Liverpool fan pays his respects to the 96 supporters who died at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989\r\n       \"The day itself will never leave you. Then there was the aftermath as well, going to the hospital in Sheffield on the Monday. The first person that came to us was a mother with a 14-year-old son. The life support machine was going to be cut off and she wanted us to see the boy before they cut it off.\n     \"It was a million times worse and more for the mother but nobody prepares you for that. You're talking to a boy - and my son Adam was eight at the time and my daughter Lucy was five - that when you leave they are going to cut off the life support machine. I can hardly describe it.\n     \"The days after Hillsborough provided the whole range of emotions, when you are just crying your eyes out. You'd go up to Anfield talking to the bereaved and no-one knew what had happened. I'll never forget it until the day I die.\n     \"We were like counsellors. We didn't have any training and half the time families would talk to us and we were the ones who were crying.\"\n     Liverpool eventually returned to action and, despite losing out on the league title after Michael Thomas's last-minute goal for Arsenal, went on to win the FA Cup with victory over Everton.\n     However, Hansen adds: \"If I'd lost somebody, would I have wanted Liverpool to keep going in the FA Cup? The answer was probably not, but there were a lot of families that wanted it. When you go on the pitch you are thinking about nothing other than the game - it is totally bizarre in many ways. \n     \"It was sadness beyond belief and there were times when we were crying our eyes out and yet as soon as we got back on the pitch we were still going for the title and were 100% immersed in the football. There was almost a guilt thing at times. You are filled with sadness, then you are going out and playing.\"\n     Hansen's part in that semi-final was a reluctant one after fighting to regain full fitness following a serious knee injury.\n     He admits: \"I didn't want to play. I injured my knee in Spain in pre-season, had only played one reserve game on the Tuesday night and had only been back in training three weeks. \n     \"There was a virus which Barry Venison got and somebody else got and [manager] Kenny [Dalglish] told me I had to play. I told him I couldn't. I was 33 at the time and to go in straightaway might have been OK for someone who was 23 - but I was in.\n     \"I was totally immersed in the game and blind to anything. Two guys came on the pitch and I was the first there. I thought it was an invasion and told them they'd better get off or we'd be in trouble. I was maybe a bit off with them, then one lad looked me in the eye and said, 'Al, there are people dying in there.'\n     \"Even then I was thinking 'surely not' but then we came off and the whole reality hit us.\"\n     There was a footballing context for Liverpool as Dalglish, who emerged as the symbol of the club during the months following Hillsborough, succumbed to the strain and resigned in February 1991 with the club reigning champions.\n     Although Liverpool have not won a title since then, Hansen does not regard Dalglish's departure as the catalyst for those barren years.\n     He says: \"Without a shadow of a doubt it took its toll on Kenny. He did so much - setting up things for the families, with his wife Marina taking calls from relatives.\n     \"But it was an ageing team and the hardest thing for any manager to do is to break a team up, as Manchester United have found. I wouldn't say Hillsborough or Kenny going was the catalyst for any decline. \n Liverpool's last league title was in 1990 - the season after the Hillsborough disaster\r\n       \"The hardest part of any successful unit is to break it up and start again. Liverpool had done it about five times and sooner or later there is the chance you will not get it quite right.\"\n     Hansen believes Liverpool have a great opportunity to put that right this season, saying: \"All the way through the golden era the league title was the most important and always will be. Out of all the four tournaments, when they used to be big, the league was always the one we wanted.\n     \"Liverpool haven't won it for 24 years. It could be the start of a new era - and it is that important because next season Manchester United won't be as bad again and Manchester City and Chelsea will spend big.\n     \"Will Luis Suarez ever have another season like he has just had? If Liverpool win the league the supporters will regard it as being back where they belong.\n The Premier League table as it stands\r\n       \"Anfield will be very emotional on Sunday. The atmosphere will be phenomenal and Manchester City are a very good side but every time Liverpool have been asked the question they've answered.\"\n     And if manager Rodgers does emulate Dalglish, the victims of Hillsborough and their families will be in his thoughts.\n     \"We can't say too much about Hillsborough because the inquests are under way,\" says Rodgers. \"But as a manager coming into the football club I know there are 96 people in the sky who will always be supporting this football team.\n     \"If we are to achieve anything this year, they will always be in our thoughts - the 96 in the sky and the families that go with them.\"\n ", "subject": "Sports", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26969869", "title": ["Hillsborough: Liverpool target title for '96 in the sky'"]},

Paul Lambert plays down relegation fears     Grant Holt went close for Villa, before Yannick Bolasie's penalty appeal was turned down when he went down under pressure from Holt, but no contact had been made.\n     Palace were engineering the best chances, with Bolasie and Jerome again at the centre of the action after the break. \n     Bolasie forced an acrobatic save from Brad Guzan and Jerome, two yards from goal, directed the rebound onto the crossbar. \n     Palace continued to threaten. Bolasie went close from close range, a Puncheon free-kick forced Guzan into action, and referee Webb initially awarded a penalty to the hosts before changing his mind after consulting with an assistant referee. \n  Media requires JavaScript to play.
