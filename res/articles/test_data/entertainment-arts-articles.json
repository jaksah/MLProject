Walters is being recognised for her contribution to film and TV, where she began partnering comedian Victoria Wood in shows such as Wood and Walters. She was Oscar-nominated for her turn, opposite Sir Michael Caine, in the 1983 film Educating Rita. \"I'm completely honoured and thrilled,\" the actress said. \"I got a letter just saying 'you've been chosen, would you accept it?'\" she told Chris Evans on his Radio 2 Breakfast show.  Media requires JavaScript to play. \"That was it. It was just like an email, and I emailed them back and said, 'yeah, great!'\" In a statement, she added she had \"worked with some brilliant people over the years\" and had been \"very fortunate to have had the opportunities to work on such a variety of projects\". Walters, who was made a CBE in 2008, originally trained as a nurse before studying English and drama and going to work for the Everyman Theatre Group in Liverpool, where her contemporaries included Bill Nighy and writer Alan Bleasdale. She played various minor roles before teaming up on TV with Woods, with whom she had previously appeared on stage. She gained international stardom with the comedy film Educating Rita, playing a working class woman who turns to academia to try and better her life. The film was nominated for three Oscars, though Walters - who won the Bafta and Golden Globe for best actress, lost out to Terms of Endearment's Shirley MacLaine on the night. Walters won another Bafta for best supporting actress in 2001 for the film Billy Elliot. She won the best actress category at the Bafta TV awards for three consecutive years between 2002 and 2004, for her roles in My Beautiful Son, Murder and Canterbury Tales. She was given the prize a fourth time in 2010 for her portrayal of former Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam. She recently starred in the BBC's Shakespeare series The Hollow Crown. Chief Executive of Bafta, Amanda Berry called Walters \"one the most talented individuals to grace our screens\". \"She has the innate ability,\" she added, \"to draw the viewer in across any genre, captivating and entertaining with every performance.  \"Julie is thoroughly deserving of the Fellowship, the highest honour the Academy can bestow.\" Walters will receive the award at this year's television Baftas at the Theatre Royal in London on 18 May. She said her speech would require \"a bit of thought\".  \"It's an award that's right at the end of the evening, so nobody wants a great big [speech] so I'm going to have to judge it carefully.\" Previous recipients include Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, Richard Curtis and Sir David Jason.

The BBC executive currently works in the science and natural history unit, where she commissioned shows such as Stargazing Live and Frozen Planet. She has also suggested TV \"hasn't tried hard enough\" to find female science presenters. BBC director of TV, Danny Cohen, called her \"an exceptional creative\" talent. BBC Two has always been one of the most creative channels in the world, with a huge range of quality programming.\u201d \"She has an eye for scale and the bigger picture and seeks out distinctive, high-quality ideas. BBC Two is in fantastic shape and I'm looking forward to seeing the channel blossom further under Kim's leadership.\" Shillinglaw has been critical of the lack of representation of women on television, particularly on science and factual programmes.  in 2011, she accepted some of the blame, saying: \"perhaps we programme-makers just haven't tried hard enough\". But, she added, the BBC had made efforts to redress the balance, hiring the likes of physicist Helen Czerski, climate expert Dr Gabrielle Walker and space scientist Maggie Aderin Pocock to front series and documentaries. She has also criticised the shortage of female comedians on panel shows, including BBC Two's Mock The Week. \"Why are the only women on Mock The Week compilations laughing cutaways?\" she  , predating the BBC edict that outlawed all-male line-ups. \"They never get to speak. Surely not because [they're] not funny?\" An Oxford History graduate, Shillinglaw has had a long career in broadcasting, both at the BBC and in the independent TV sector. In her current role, she commissions more than 200 hours of television per year, with programmes including Planet Earth Live, Pompeii, Richard Hammond's Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Planet Dinosaur, Dara O'Briain's Science Club and Springwatch. She has also worked in children's television, where she developed the first series of Horrible Histories. Of her new role, she said: \"BBC Two has always been one of the most creative channels in the world, with a huge range of quality programming. \"I'm delighted and honoured by the prospect of working with the best of our British talent and programme makers; I look forward to taking it and BBC Four to the next phase of great, thought-provoking and lively TV for British audiences.\" Shillinglaw was paid \u00a3160,340 last year. The BBC has not revealed her new salary - but her predecessor's final salary was \u00a3235,050. Janice Hadlow, who stepped down from BBC Two last year, commissioned shows such as The Great British Bake-Off and Twenty Twelve.

DJ Steve Lamacq revealed the   as part of a week-long celebration to mark the 20th birthday of Britpop. More than 30,000 people voted, with The Verve's Bittersweet Symphony second and Oasis tracks Don't Look Back in Anger and Wonderwall in third and fourth. Their chart rivals Blur were in fifth place with Parklife.  Pulp's Common People only made it to number two in the charts when it was released in May 1995 - denied the top spot by Robson Green and Jerome Flynn's Unchained Melody.  Included in Pulp's Different Class album, it featured Sadie Frost in the video and the lyrics were based on a girl who singer Jarvis Cocker met while studying at Central Saint Martin's art college. The lyrics reveal the girl from a wealthy family, had told him she wanted to live in the East End of London with \"the common people\".  \"It is one of the defining records of Britpop because it seemed to embrace the essence of the time so perfectly,\" said Lamacq, who led the Britpop at the BBC celebrations along with former co-presenter Jo Whiley. \"It was a big, bold anthem, but with a great narrative. And it seemed to sum up a feeling of 'us and them', as if to illustrate how the indie mavericks had taken on the pop stars and - for once - they'd won.\" Pulp also featured at number nine in the countdown with Disco 2000, while Suede hit Animal Nitrate was in sixth place and Blur's Girls and Boys in seventh.   Listeners were asked to vote for their all-time favourite Britpop anthem - the one song that epitomised that time for them.  The Bluetones made it to number eight with Slight Return, while Ash rounded off the top ten with Girl from Mars.  Britpop favourites Elastica, Shed 7, Menswear, Radiohead and Space also made the top 30 countdown.  Other highlights from the week of special Britpop at the BBC programmes included Lamacq and Jo Whiley being reunited to revisit their old Radio 1 show The Evening Session.  Their   included Supergrass singer Gaz Coombes, Sleeper frontwoman Louise Wener and Damon Albarn. ",

Many studios have tried to capitalise on the success of films like Calendar Girls and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, both of which had older casts. But Thompson told BBC Radio 4's   that separating audiences into groups was \"a mistake culturally, artistically and economically.\" The actress appeared on the show to promote her new film, The Love Punch.  The film, which co-stars Pierce Brosnan and Celia Imrie, has a slightly older cast than a typical Hollywood blockbuster, but Thompson said it aimed \"to entertain everybody\". \"This film isn't for older people, that would be a tragic mistake to indicate that we were making this for older people,\" she said.  \"What I find really fantastic about it is that it's young people who seem to enjoy it just as much, if not more.\" Thompson continued: \"I don't see where age has to come into it - it's been made to entertain everybody in the groups that we're supposed to be in, which is a selection of ages. \"The fact is that the film industry has tried to separate us into groups, and it's a mistake culturally, artistically and economically.\"  The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which starred Dame Judi Dench, Dame Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy as British pensioners at a retirement hotel in India, took $134m (\u00a383m) worldwide in 2012.  It was a huge return on an estimated $10m (\u00a36.2m) budget and a sequel is currently being filmed. Titles such as Last Vegas, Quartet and A Song for Marion have followed in its wake.  They are said to be targeting the \"grey pound\" - targeting the ageing population, who can often visit the cinema during the quieter daytime periods. \"I long for the day where we don't have to talk about our age as actresses,\" said Imrie, pointing out that her character's age in The Love Punch was \"incidental\" to the plot.  \"I don't want us to have to bang on about it anymore, because the more actresses go on the more interesting and fascinating they are,\" Imrie told Front Row.  \"You look into an older woman's face and there's a whole lifetime of life, and that's what we're depicting.  \"It's very rare that we're ever asked to play actresses, we're asked to play people in life and therefore the more life you live the richer, hopefully, you can be.\"  Thompson told presenter John Wilson that women have to fight for roles as they get older: \"Not only fighting for the roles, but fighting for female rights in general.\" \"For women a lot of the time, the only power that they do have in their roles on screen is the sexual power,\" Thompson added.  \"So when that sexuality becomes older, and therefore a great deal more threatening, the roles dry up - because women don't have access to the kinds of power that create the kind of story that people are writing about. \"The roles of women in life - in political life, business life, everything - are absolutely mirrored by what we see in cinema.\" Thompson was last seen on screen as Mary Poppins creator PL Travers in Saving Mr Banks and recently filmed Jason Reitman's Men, Women and Children.  She said it was important to \"challenge yourself\" by taking on different kinds of roles. \"I think it was after Sense and Sensibility my Mum said, 'So what are you going to do next, are you going to play another good woman in a frock?'. And I thought, 'Bloody hell, thanks Mum.' But I know what she meant.\" Thompson continued: \"If you challenge yourself to do something different, I think the more experience you have the more interesting it is to meet that challenge, and sometimes really surprising things come out of it.\" ",

Nirvana were among the acts inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Grunge band Nirvana have been enlisted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, alongside the likes of Kiss and Beatles manager Brian Epstein. REM's Michael Stipe inducted the group, saying: \"Nirvana tapped into a voice that was yearning to be heard.  \"Nirvana were kicking against the mainstream. They spoke truth and a lot of people listened.\"  Nirvana fans walk up to me every day and say thank you for the music\u201d The band's career was cut short by Kurt Cobain's death in 1994. His widow, Courtney Love, attended the ceremony. \"You know, I have a big speech, but I'm not going to say it,\" she said, before hugging Cobain's bandmates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl. \"That's it,\" she concluded. \"I just wish Kurt was here to do this.\" Grohl, Nirvana's drummer and now frontman of rock group Foo Fighters, paid tribute to the musicians who formed the early line-ups of Nirvana, in particular drummer Chad Channing, who he singled out for his contributions to the band's breakthrough album Nevermind. Bass guitarist Novoselic added: \"Nirvana fans walk up to me every day and say thank you for the music. \"When I hear that, I think of Kurt Cobain.\" Nirvana received their place in the Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Artists can only be considered for the honour 25 years after their first release. The remaining members, also including guitarist Pat Smear, were joined on stage by four female musicians to perform some of the band's best-known songs. Joan Jett sang Smells Like Teen Spirit, Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon took on Aneurysm, alternative musician St. Vincent performed Lithium, while New Zealand pop star Lorde sang All Apologies. Other honourees at the New York ceremony included Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, 15 years after their leader was inducted as a solo artist. He welcomed the band on stage, saying: \"I told a story with the E Street Band that was, and is, bigger than anything I could have told on my own.\"  \"We suffered ageing, illness and death together,\" Springsteen said. \"We took care of each other when trouble knocked, and we hurt each other in big and small ways. In the end, we stuck with each other.\" Their induction took 85 minutes, including performances of The E Street Shuffle, The River and Kitty's Back. They were followed into the Hall of Fame by Maneater singers Daryl Hall and John Oates.  \"Lucky for you, there are only two of us,\" Hall said to laughter from the audience.  Britain's Peter Gabriel was inducted by Coldplay singer Chris Martin, and made light of his elaborate stage outfits as a member of Genesis in the 1970s. \"Dream big, and let your imagination guide you, even if you end up dressing as a flower or a sexually transmitted disease.\" Another British honouree was Cat Stevens, whose hits included Matthew and Son and Wild World. \"Thanks so much to my fans for believing,\" said Stevens, who gave up music for 25 years after converting to Islam and changing his name to Yusuf Islam in 1977. \"I can still see some sceptical faces, but my fans believed.\" Rock legends Kiss were one of the more controversial inductees, having pulled out of a performance at the ceremony over a disagreement about their line-up. Famous for their elaborate stage make-up and costumes, the band wanted to play with their current line-up, including founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, causing friction with retired members Ace Frehley and Peter Criss. I think those people basically hijacked the name rock and roll\u201d But the quartet made peace and saluted each other in heartfelt induction speeches.  \"This is a pivotal moment for all of us,\" said Simmons, the bass player on hits like Crazy Nights and Rock and Roll All Nite.  \"We are humbled that the fans gave us the chance to do what we loved doing.\" Country queen Linda Ronstadt, who has Parkinson's disease, was unable to attend the ceremony, instead receiving a musical tribute from Carrie Underwood, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow and Stevie Nicks. Glenn Frey, who played in Ronstadt's band before joining the Eagles, led her induction with a glowing tribute to \"one of the greatest voices of all time\". \"Linda Ronstadt recorded 31 albums. She sold over 100 million records and had a career that spanned five decades,\" he said.  \"She has been a shining example and a true inspiration to every woman who ever stood in front of a microphone and sang her heart out.\" The ceremony also saw the first ever inductions for managers of rock bands, which went to the late Brian Epstein, who guided the Beatles to stardom, and Andrew Loog Oldham, who launched the careers of the Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart and Eric Clapton. However, the former Stones' manager boycotted the ceremony. \"I won't be there,\" he said at a  . \"I'll tell you why: It's a television show.  \"Twenty years ago, it was an incredible party in the Waldorf-Astoria where everybody could behave exactly as they could 20 years ago.  \"And then it became a business.

If you put the most important cultural elements in society into the hands of commercial people who want to make a profit they will bring it down to the lowest common denominator\u201d Richard Hoggart was brought up in Leeds in a working-class background, and was orphaned at the age of eight.  His experiences played a part in the thesis of his influential book, The Uses of Literacy, in which he argued the working classes deserved better in educational and cultural terms than society provided for them. The book was written in 1957, but Hoggart fought all his life against popular consumerism - what he described as the corrupt brightness of mass entertainments. He once said: \"If you put the most important cultural elements in society into the hands of commercial people who want to make a profit they will bring it down to the lowest common denominator.\" In a long career he was, among other things, a professor of English at Birmingham University, assistant director general of Unesco and vice-chairman of the Arts Council.  He founded the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies which influenced academic interest in cultural and media studies around the world. A champion of liberal thinking, Hoggart was a key defence witness at the Lady Chatterley obscenity trial in 1960. Among his later targets were terms such as positive discrimination and senior citizens. He said: \"Senior citizens is a bogus attribution. It was dreamed up in an ad agency or a PR office. It's cheap and insincere flattery, and anybody over 50 should reject it.\" Despite his many distinguished posts, he refused a knighthood and a peerage. ",

Paul Weller, Wilko Johnson and Soul II Soul will perform alongside Biffy Clyro, Ed Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Arctic Monkeys at Balado this summer. A number of breakthrough acts including Earl Sweatshirt, Wilkinson and Jess Glynn have also joined the lineup. The festival will be held on the weekend of 11 to 13 July. Former The Jam and Style Council musician Weller, known as the Modfather, has been a fixture on the British music scene for decades. He headlined the second ever T in the Park in 1995 and performed at the first festival to be held at Balado in 1997. Weller will be playing alongside one of his biggest musical influences in Wilko Johnson, the former Dr Feelgood guitarist who also recently appeared on HBO TV series Game of Thrones as executioner Ilyn Payne. Soul II Soul became a household name in the 1980s after winning a Grammy award for their hit Back to Life, and are appearing at T in the Park as part of their 25th anniversary celebrations. Festival director Geoff Ellis described Weller as \"a true icon of British music\". He added: \"When Wilko Johnson takes to the stage I think it'll be a very special moment - he's had a seminal influence on the country's music scene, and is one of Weller's own heroes.  \"Soul II Soul were similarly groundbreaking when they rose to prominence in the 80s, and their set will be pretty spectacular also.  \"Plus we're delighted to be bringing some of the most hotly tipped new breakthrough acts to this year's festival too - there's a lot of buzz about these acts right now.\" Earl Sweatshirt, the youngest member of Los Angeles hip-hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, is one of the most hotly anticipated new acts appearing, after his solo album Doris went down well with critics.  Drum and bass electronica producer Wilkinson is also hotly tipped, after remixing established artists including Chase & Status and Professor Green. And singer Jess Glynn has already featured on two chart-topping hits this year - fellow T in the Park act Clean Bandit's number one dance track Rather Be and Route 94's My Love. The LaFontaines, The Amazing Snakeheads, Darlia, Charli XCX and Little Matador are also among the newcomers on the bill. Alongside the headliners, other acts performing at the three-day festival include Ellie Goulding, Manic Street Preachers, Pixies, Jake Bugg, Elbow, and Paolo Nutini.

The short but sweet note from Dylan Thomas to wife Caitlin, scribbled on the back of a bank stub, will be returned to Swansea thanks to \u00a3935,700 from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). The Dylan Thomas Centre is being expanded so more treasures can be seen. It is all part of the celebrations marking the centenary of his birth. The love letter is addressed to \"My darling own dear dear Cat\" and apologises that cheques the poet had sent her are late because work commitments prevented him from getting to the bank.  It was later sold by Thomas in 1941 to the University of Buffalo in New York. Money from the HLF will ensure that the new look exhibition will be opened in time to mark the centenary of Thomas' birthday in October. The grant will also allow the Grade II-listed building to show significantly more than 950 artefacts while an education and multimedia audio and video suite will also be created. Thomas' granddaughter Hannah Ellis, who has played a key role in the project, said: \"The centre is home to the largest collection of Dylan Thomas-related material in the world, a collection that provides a unique insight into who my grandfather truly was.  \"I want young and new audiences to be able to learn about and discover my grandfather's poems, his stories and his plays. This grant from the HLF will bring the exhibition into the 21st Century and open it up for future generations to enjoy.\"  The poet, whose work includes Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night and the play Under Milk Wood, died in 1953 aged 39. Former president of the United States Jimmy Carter, a devoted fan of Thomas, said: \"Dylan Thomas was one of the greatest poets of the past century and I have always felt an affinity to his poetry and literature. \"I have continuously advocated the importance of commemorating his life and work and having first opened this important centre in Swansea, it is great to see that this funding will ensure that the Dylan Thomas Centre can continue to thrive in years to come.\" ",

If takings from those early screenings were excluded, Marvel film Captain America: The Winter Soldier was the top draw between Friday and Sunday. Rio 2 made \u00a32.88m in its first week in cinemas, more than the \u00a32.76m Marvel's movie made in its second weekend. The animation's total includes the \u00a3703,000 it made on 29 and 30 March.

        "article": "Celebrated British composer Michael Nyman has composed a Hillsborough memorial symphony to open 2014's Liverpool Biennial on 5 July.  The hour-long Symphony No 11: Memorial is based on music that Nyman was recording on the afternoon of the Hillsborough tragedy 25 years ago.  It will be performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. Local-born mezzo soprano Kathryn Rudge will sing the names of the 96 Liverpool football fans who lost their lives. They died following a crush at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 and their families are currently appearing at fresh inquests into their deaths.  They are being held in Warrington after being ordered in December 2012, when the High Court quashed the original accidental death verdicts. Nyman said he hopes the work will make \"a small but significant contribution to the healing process still necessary for the families of the lost fans.\" The symphony will be performed at Liverpool Cathedral, with the orchestra and Rudge accompanied by the Liverpool Philharmonic Youth and Training Choirs, conducted by Josep Vicent. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said the city would \"never forget those who lost their lives at Hillsborough\".  \"Memorials are a symbol of our solidarity and support for the families, and Nyman's specially commissioned piece of music will be a moving and unforgettable tribute,\" said Anderson.  \"It is certain to be a highlight of this year's Biennial and a fantastic example of art being used to help shine a light on the dignity and bravery of those who have strived for justice for the 96,\" he added.  The symphony is inspired by Nyman's piece of music known as Memorial, a funeral march-style piece composed in 1985 - subsequently used in the film The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, starring Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren.   As a separate project for the Liverpool Biennial, Nyman will create a new film installation entitled Aztecs in Liverpool, including footage collected by Nyman over the past 20 years in his newly-adopted home of Mexico.     The 2014 Biennial Exhibition is entitled A Needle Walks into a Haystack and will take place in seven venues across the city, including the Bluecoat and the historic Trade Union Centre on Hardman Street. Other events announced on Wednesday include a transformation of Tate Liverpool's Wolfson Gallery by French architect, Claude Parent. ",

The organisation, which pays musicians when their songs are played on radio, or in concert, said revenues had increased 3.7% in the last year. Last year saw an 11.7% rise in international revenue, with international royalties breaking \u00a3200m. PRS reported   in 2011. A rise in international demand for UK television shows and streaming services helped 2013's increase in revenue across Europe, North America and Australia. Online revenues reached \u00a361.2m in 2013, an increase of 18.3%, which was helped by new and renewed deals with the likes of Deezer and YouTube. The online market continues to evolve apace, with the increasing transition from downloads to streaming. Last year's revenue also shows that television and radio continues to provide significant income for songwriters and composers.  New licensing deals for services such as BT Sport resulted in a revenue of \u00a3160.4m, an increase of 4.8%. However, the closure of HMV branches and other retailers contributed to a 21% decline in revenue from the recorded media market.

The 41-year-old joined the soap in 1993, as Bianca Jackson. The BBC said her character would not be killed off. A spokesman for the actress said she was \"really sad to be leaving the show as she loves playing Bianca... but she knows it's the right decision at this time in her life.\" Palmer leaves the show in the autumn. \"We are so sad that Patsy has decided to leave us, but completely understand that it's the right time for her,\" said the show's executive producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins. \"There's still a lot more to come from her on screen this year - and the door will be left wide open for her return.  \"We won't be getting rid of Bianca's Puffa jacket just yet.\" Palmer has left the show once before, in 1999, when her character went to art college in Manchester. She returned for a one-off episode in 2002, before resuming the role full time in 2008. Bianca, like many of Albert Square's residents, has had her fair share of problems. Her   have included abortion, infidelity, debt and a spell in prison.  But she is perhaps best-known for her relationship with Ricky Butcher, played by Sid Owen. The couple's marriage in 1997 gave the BBC One show one of its biggest-ever audiences - in excess of 22 million - although the ceremony was nearly cancelled after a riotous stag night. The couple became known for their comical arguments, often preceded by Bianca's exasperated \"Rickaaaay!\"  They divorced in 1999 but remarried when EastEnders turned 25 in 2010. Outside the show Palmer, the mother of four, has taken part in charity editions of Strictly Come Dancing and The Apprentice.

        "article": "Welsh director Gareth Evans reveals why he chose to make a follow-up to The Raid, the low-budget martial arts thriller that became an international hit in 2011. Indonesian film The Raid cost around $1 million (\u00a3596,000) to make but made 15 times that sum at the worldwide box office in 2011. Described by some film critics as \"the best action film of all time\", its visceral martial arts scenes and large body count made it a cult classic with fans. Now The Raid 2 arrives in UK cinemas, four months on from its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Its maker is 34-year-old Gareth Evans, originally from Hirwaun in south Wales, who now lives in Indonesia.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Gareth Evans talks to BBC Wales Today about his career and films According to Evans, the first film's plot was \"pretty simple, because we had no budget. A policeman, Rama, has to fight his way to the top of a gang-controlled building without dying himself.\" In contrast, The Raid 2 \"has far more of a story [that] expands the criminal world of the first film\". \"If the audience are willing to follow us into it,\" Evans continues, \"it will have a very different feel to the first one.\" The Raid became the most successful Indonesian film release of all time, prompting international interest in Pencak Silat, the local martial art it featured, and making a star of Iko Uwais, the stuntman-actor who plays Rama.  Evans and Uwais had worked together before on Merentau, a cult martial arts hit in Indonesia. The international reaction to The Raid, though, took both by surprise. \"I never expected it,\" admits Evans. \"And at first it felt like there was a certain amount of novelty publicity around it. A Welshman has made this Indonesian martial arts movie, there's a thing! \"What it has done is given both myself and Iko a certain amount of career security. I certainly had offers to make other films after it came out, but nothing compared to the prospect of making the sequel. I was passionately committed to it.\" Now signed to the prestigious William Morris talent agency in the US, Evans is also serving as a producer on a Hollywood remake of The Raid. The film will be made by The Expendables 3 director Patrick Hughes, with   suggesting Australian actor Chris Hemsworth or his brother Liam will take the lead role. \"I know that it's inevitable that a great foreign language movie will be made and Hollywood will want to remake it,\" sighs Evans. \"Just like The Ring or Let the Right One In, fans will look at it and say 'why on earth is it getting remade? The only thing that's any different is there are no subtitles.' \"But the way I see it is that some kid who listens to Justin Bieber will probably go and see the Hollywood version of The Raid, and then he might discover the foreign originals that I've made. \"Once he's seen these films, I doubt he'll like Justin Bieber any more. In that way, I'll have done some good in the world.\" The Raid 2 picks up a couple of hours from where the first film ended, with Rama - having just disposed of hundreds of criminals - being asked to go undercover in prison. Those who loved the first story for its non-stop martial arts sequences may be disappointed that the new film, at two-and-a-half hours and with five times the budget, has more dialogue and conversation pieces in the criminal underworld where it is set. \"I don't think I've made a big, bloated film with the budget I've had,\" Evans counters. \"In fact, every penny is on screen again. \"I hope fans will like it because this is the film I originally wrote, when I wanted to make the first Raid, but we simply didn't have the money. \"I was a frustrated director, simply desperate to make a film, and so I rewrote it to be set around one building, which was considerably cheaper than multiple locations. \"This still has all the blood and guts of the first; I think there might be more actually. I hope it's still a visceral spectacle. \"The Raid 2 is very violent. I appreciate some people won't like that, but you have to remember we are following a film tradition of Indonesian martial arts films. I want to have made something edgy.\" Uwais and Evans are now local heroes in Indonesia, where they are credited for bringing back a martial art movie tradition that, according to the director, \"died off in the 1970s\". Despite this, the Welshman reveals his next two directing jobs will be in the UK and the US.  \"Everything is working really, really well for me right now,\" he says. \"Just being able to make a film is a dream come true.\" Raid fans need not fret, though. Evans is open that the series was designed as a trilogy and has pledged will return to direct the final instalment.  \"I've already planned it out - it's definitely going to happen,\" he insists. \"There's going to be no rest for the characters at the end of this film.\" ",

Millar made his name writing for Marvel Comics and created Kick-Ass, a graphic novel that was made into two films. His new comic MPH tells the story of four Detroit street kids who find a drug that gives them superhuman speed. They use their powers to \"take down the bankers, corporations and the crooked politicians\" who wrecked Detroit. Millar, from Coatbridge in Lanarkshire, says the superheroes fight against the people who \"sold Detroit down the river for three successive generations\". Last year,  , with $18bn (\u00a312bn) of debt. Detroit, once a symbol of US industrial power, has faced decades of decline and last summer public services were on the verge of collapse and about 70,000 properties lay abandoned. Illustrated by Duncan Fegredo, whose other work includes the Hellboy comics, copies of MPH have also been sent to all US senators. Millar  : \"Superheroes have been my bread and butter my entire adult life and with superheroes comes a natural love of both America and Americana.\" However, he said a trip to Detroit as part of a book signing tour had a \"profound\" effect on him. He said the news that one of America's biggest cities had filed for bankruptcy was shocking but \"nothing compares to standing there and looking at it with your own eyes\". The writer said: \"How could the richest country in the world allow so many of its people to live in such abject poverty?\" Millar said Detroit needed superheroes but not the traditional ones like super-rich playboy Bruce Wayne in Batman, or billionaire weapons dealer Tony Stark in Iron Man. He said: \"Sometimes I wonder if it's political sleight-of-hand to write about threats to Gotham City or Metropolis when we should be writing about those bad guys in the real world who look an awful lot like Bruce Wayne.\" The writer added: \"Is it a crime if a superhero puts food on the table for people who have nothing? \"Four superheroes taking down the bankers couldn't be more different than Superman or Batman, who sometimes look the other way when the real villains are operating. \"These are the good guys America needs right now.\" Millar said he had put his \"heart and soul\" into the comic book and Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the producer on three Transformers movies, was planning to turn it into a Hollywood film.  As well as comic books, Millar worked on 2008 movie Wanted starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy; 2010's Kick-Ass starring Nicholas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz; and last year's Kick-Ass 2 featuring Jim Carrey. Millar's next film is Kingsmen: The Secret Service, which will star Colin Firth and Samuel L Jackson. ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. The sermon was written after Mansfield Park was published but may have been influenced by earlier drafts of the novel, experts think A handwritten note by Jane Austen \"hidden\" for 150 years on the back of a fragment of paper has been revealed. Experts have linked the text on both the front and back to themes in the author's novel Mansfield Park. The fragment was stuck to a letter discovered in a first edition of her memoirs, written by her nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh.  The revealed text is part of a sermon apparently composed by her brother, the Reverend James Austen in 1814. The book and letter, written by Jane Austen's nephew in 1870, had been held in a private collection but was recently bought for an undisclosed sum by the Jane Austen museum in Chawton, Hampshire. Very few examples of Jane Austen's handwriting survive - there are no manuscripts of her famous books and many of her letters were destroyed after her death. A team at West Dean College near Chichester, West Sussex, succeeded in unsticking the fragment, allowing the previously unseen writing on the back to be deciphered. It reads: \"...great propriety preserved - Wherever... wanted to be cleared of the Superstitious... of Popery... or whenever new ones were to be... composed in order to fill up & connect the Services... with a true spirit.\" While the front of the fragment reads: \"Men may get into a habit of repeating the words of our Prayers by rote, perhaps without thoroughly understanding - certainly without thoroughly feeling their full force and meaning.\"  Experts claim the text echoes a passage in Mansfield Park which was also published in 1814 - a few months before the sermon text was written. They say it reflects a discussion in the novel on the \"art of reading\" and its importance to the modern clergyman. Jane Austen's eldest brother, James, was rector at the church of St Nicholas in Steventon, and she would travel there to stay with him. Historians believe she helped copy out his sermons for him. Mary Guyatt, museum curator, said: \"What we have to go on is the nephew's transcription.  \"He's cut up the sermon in around 1817 and he's written underneath it 'this is the writing but not the words of the author Jane Austen, my aunt.' \"He's very clear that it was his father's composition.\" But Prof Kathryn Sutherland, of St Anne's College, Oxford, said it showed earlier drafts of Mansfield Park at least influenced her brother. \"The scrap raises the possibility that the novel inspired James's sermon and even demonstrates the cross-fertilization between Jane Austen's creative writing and the wider life of her family.\" Historians will now study the note for clues to whether the sermon may after all have been written by Jane Austen. It will go on display at the museum later this year. ",

Welcome to New York, screened at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday, is about a French banker who sexually assaults a maid at a New York hotel. Mr Strauss-Kahn quit as head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011 after facing similar allegations. The 65-year-old was arrested in New York three years ago when a maid at the Sofitel hotel in New York accused him of trying to rape her. The charges were eventually dropped, and Mr Strauss-Kahn subsequently reached a settlement with the maid, Nafissatou Diallo. He is   in an unrelated case in France on charges of hiring prostitutes for sex parties - allegations he denies.  His lawyer, Jean Veil, said the former IMF boss would take legal action for \"defamation over the accusations of rape and the insinuations made throughout the movie\". He added that Mr Strauss-Kahn was \"disgusted and frightened\" by the film, which stars French actor Gerard Depardieu in the lead role. \"The prosecutor in New York cleared him of all charges [and] he has a right to be forgotten like everyone else,\" Mr Veil told French radio station Europe 1 on Monday. The lawyer also alleged that Welcome to New York carried \"anti-Semitic\" overtones. This was echoed by Mr Strauss-Kahn's ex-wife, Anne Sinclair, who accused Mr Ferrara and producers of projecting their \"fantasies about money and Jews\". Welcome to New York tells the story of how a French economics professor becomes a politician backed by his wife's millions and rises to fame and prosperity only to be brought down by accusations of rape. The film's American director, Abel Ferrara, responded to news of the lawsuit by invoking his \"freedom of expression\". \"[Strauss-Kahn] is not the only guy who got caught in a situation like this,\" he said, adding: \"Let my lawyer talk to his lawyer.\" The movie opens with a disclaimer, which reads: \"This film was inspired by a court case, the public stages of which have been filmed, broadcast , reported and commented on throughout the media worldwide. Nonetheless the characters portrayed in the film and all sequences depicting their private lives remain entirely fictional.\" The film, which was funded mostly in the US, will not be screened in French cinemas, and instead only shown on pay-to-view websites. Depardieu put some of his own money into the movie and took a low fee of 100,000 euros (\u00a381,000).  Producer Vincent Maraval had previously criticised the French political, TV and movie establishment for refusing to finance the film. \"Everyone warned us not to make this film, both our friends and our enemies,\" he said   with US magazine Variety.

The sports presenter invested thousands into Icebreaker, a company which purported to support young musicians. However, a recent court ruling said the firm was \"understood by all concerned to be a tax avoidance scheme\". Logan says she invested in the scheme in \"good faith\" and vowed \"to pay any tax\" she owes. She added that she pulled out of the scheme in 2012. \"I have been completely open and honest with HMRC and I have never hidden anything\u201d Logan issued the following statement  , following press speculation about her involvement in the scheme. \"I was advised about a business opportunity six years ago (2008) and I invested in good faith.  \"It was explained to me as a way of funding new acts in the music industry. Because of information which came to light in 2012, I decided the investment was not right for me.  \"With new professional help and advisors, I have for some time been working to resolve the issue and I fully intend to pay any tax which should have been paid, had I not entered the business. The presenter said she had been \"completely open and honest\" with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), adding: \"I have never hidden anything.\" Take That singer Gary Barlow - along with band-mates Howard Donald and Mark Owen, and manager Jonathan Wild - were among about 1,000 people who put money into the Icebreaker scheme. Since March 2010, the four men have been directors of Larkdale LLP - one of 50 partnerships that Icebreaker arranged to harness tax reliefs that the government had intended would support those in creative industries. The tribunal found that shortly after money was put in to Larkdale LLP, it reported huge losses of more than \u00a325m. Those losses could then be offset against tax, reducing the men's tax bills. In total, around 50 partnerships with hundreds of members invested in Icebreaker, which claimed total losses of \u00a3336m. Last week, former Olympic hurdler and BBC broadcaster Colin Jackson admitted to being in one such partnership, Sparkdale LLP, along with a number of dentists and lawyers. He defended his decision to invest in the loss-making scheme,   he was proud to have supported struggling musicians.  \"If it means you have to take a hit then I'll happily take a hit,\" he said. \"People have invested in me in the past to help me get to the top of my game. I'll still invest in people to help them get to the top of their game.\" HMRC pursued Icebreaker through the courts after the Times newspaper first exposed the scheme in 2012. Its members have until 2 July to decide whether they want to appeal. HMRC said it would be seeking payment of the tax in the meantime. ",

Officer Chris No says police arrived at the couple's home on Monday evening after a report of shots being fired. Officials say 40-year-old April Jace was found dead inside. Michael Jace, 51, was then taken into custody and booked on suspicion of homicide. He is being held on $1 million (\u00a3593,000) bail. Lt. John Jenal from the Los Angeles Police Department said two children were at the single-family home at the time of the shooting. They were in protective custody on Tuesday morning, he told LA's City News Service. Celebrity website   claims the actor called police himself to report the shooting. In March 2011, Jace filed for bankruptcy protection, with debts of between $500,000 (\u00a3297,000) and $1 million (\u00a3593,000). Much of the debt appeared to relate to his home as well as more than $22,000 (\u00a313,000) owed in state and federal income taxes. In documents submitted at the time, his wife was listed as a public school teacher with more than 10 years' experience. In a statement listing his possessions, Jace marked down that he didn't own any firearms. There are no records of any criminal cases involving the actor in Los Angeles. Jace played Detective Julien Lowe in FX drama The Shield and was a police officer in Southland. He also had parts in Forrest Gump, State of Play, Boogie Nights and Planet of the Apes.

        "article": "Netflix has announced plans to expand to a further six European countries before the end of the year. The TV and movie streaming service intends to launch in Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg. The US-based firm has 48 million subscribers in over 40 countries. One analyst said the success of the latest rollout might depend on how much content was dubbed into local languages. \"Germany potentially could be quite a difficult market as it has low pay-TV penetration and seemingly low willingness to pay,\" said Ian Maude from the media consultancy Enders Analysis. \"One thing I'm curious to see in Germany is whether or not it has dubbed a lot of the show for the market because - while French TV has a lot of subtitling - in Germany foreign language movies and TV shows are generally voiced over, and that can be quite an expensive process.\" Germany's large number of broadband users - the fourth biggest such population in the world - makes it a potentially lucrative market.  However, Netflix will have to compete against video-on-demand incumbents including Sky Deutschland's Snap, Vivendi's Watchever, ProSiebenSat.1's MaxDome and Amazon Instant Video. In France, it faces the prospect of competing against a rival that owns the rights to a series branded a \"Netflix exclusive\" in other territories: Vivendi's CanalPlay owns the domestic rights to the second season of the drama House of Cards in the country. Netflix also must contend with the fact that French audiovisual laws require local broadcasters to invest significant sums in domestic content. However, Les Echos   Netflix might get around this by basing the service in Luxembourg. For now, the firm has only said it would provide \"further details, including pricing, programming and supported devices at a later date\". California-based Netflix reported profits of $53m (\u00a332m) in its most recent quarter. We're going to learn as we go\u201d Despite previous international launches - including the Netherlands last year and the UK in 2012 - the firm's revenue is mostly generated by US subscribers. Netflix's most recent   it had 11.8 million members paying for streaming content outside the US at the end of March but about three times that figure within the country. The firm has previously said that it became profitable in Canada within two years of launch, but has not released similar information about its other foreign ventures. However, chief executive Reed Hastings recently said the company recognised that it must tailor the content it provided to each audience. \"We've seen tremendous success in the Netherlands, where we launched six months ago, and that, I think, encourages us about being able to figure out the right programming formula in each nation,\" he  . \"We're going to learn as we go. If we're very fortunate, we'll have programmed it completely correctly from day one.  \"More likely, we'll figure out some stuff's working, some stuff's not; we'll adjust the formula.\"\n ",

        "article": "Foreign language TV dramas such as The Killing and Wallander have been surprise hits. As Britain warms to subtitles at the bottom of the screen, is it time for drama in sign language to shine?  For deaf people, the recent influx of foreign drama has been good news. They are screened in their original language with very good quality \"open\" subtitles for everybody, rather than via a button on the remote control. Contrast this with the regular subtitle service, which is often criticised as poor (and sometimes missing altogether) by deaf people.  Refreshingly it seems the thousands who watch Scandinavian dramas don't have a problem following a story by reading the screen. With that potential hurdle now cleared, perhaps drama in sign language could also go mainstream in the UK - if subtitled. You may not have caught it on the fringes of the schedules over the years, but the UK has had signed drama on TV before. What's more, there is something of a \"scene\" emerging around the world. Early sign language drama featured mostly deaf actors, was mostly signed and had little spoken dialogue.  is broadcast on BBC Two at 10:30 BST on Wednesdays - or catch up on  The Young and the Speechless, a wittily-named South African drama from the 90s was an example of this genre, as was the BBC Two soap Switch and Channel 4's Rush. The balance of deaf and hearing actors in these shows was roughly 80-90% in favour of deaf signers. They appealed to a core deaf audience who wanted to see themselves represented on screen in exactly the same way as hearing people. It wasn't an attempt at inclusion or integration, it was simply felt that hearing people were already served by dozens of weekly soap operas - so the spoken word was rarely heard. But not many hearing people watched. The comparative lack of spoken dialogue may have been off-putting. In foreign language dramas, hearing people can still listen to the characters and the rich intonations and inflections of each voice even if they can't understand them.  BBC Drama commissioner Ben Stephenson tells See Hear that there is no barrier to a drama being made in British Sign Language (BSL), as long as the script is good enough. He says: \"If someone came with a script like that and it was really good, I think we would probably leap up and down with excitement, because it's really hard to find great scripts.\" A more recent breed of drama for deaf people has a 50:50 balance of speaking and signing, a rich soundtrack and a mix of deaf and hearing actors. It appeals to a much wider audience as a result and, perhaps could join shows like The Bridge and Borgen in that Saturday night foreign drama slot. There are three of these hybrid sign/speech dramas that See Hear knows about at the moment. Most successful is teen drama Switched at Birth which airs in a primetime slot on ABC Family in the US. Now in its third season, it's not yet shown in the UK. Starring Oscar-winning deaf actress Marlee Matlin (Children of a Lesser God, The West Wing), the show has undoubtedly brought deaf culture and American Sign Language to a mainstream audience.  Making sign language and deafness part of the story, but not the whole story, feels like the key to deaf drama's future success. One criticism of Switched at Birth,  however, is the lack of deaf people working off screen, either on the writing team, as directors, or in the crew. As a result, some deaf people question its authenticity.  Scandinavia, where the UK's favourite foreign language dramas come from, is the home of two more dramas with signing at the core, also airing in primetime in their home countries.  Sweden's Inte Varre an Andra (No Worse Than Others) follows a crew making a documentary about a deaf family who are rather unusual. And in Norway's  (\"Rubbish Coffee\"), two men - one deaf, one hearing - are in a serious car accident which leaves them unconscious in intensive care. Their deaf and hearing families must figure out why they were travelling together in the first place. Instead of watercooler chats about Sarah Lund's jumper and people saying 'tak', perhaps we'll see a new craze for people learning BSL \u201d The hearing actors on both dramas offer the underplayed Nordic performances which audiences have come to love. They contrast nicely with the more expressive, physical acting of their deaf counterparts who, by necessity, communicate very visually via sign. And in a nod towards inclusivity, both the signing and the speaking are fully subtitled so the viewer can follow everything whether they are deaf or hearing in Sweden or Norway.  But if these foreign dramas were aired here in the UK, deaf audiences would have to read the subtitles for the signing - because Swedish and Norwegian sign languages are very different to BSL. The themes and concerns, however, would be universal to deaf people around the world, and appreciated as such. And hearing audiences might learn about deaf culture, picking up a sign here and there, and learning about such features of deaf life as lights flashing every time the doorbell rings.  Instead of watercooler chats about Sarah Lund's jumper and people saying \"tak\", perhaps we'll see a new craze for people learning BSL or creating sign names for each other while awaiting the latest episode of the new signed drama on BBC Four. But which country will it come from?  ",

        "article": "A host of stars are attending the 67th Cannes Film Festival, one of the key events in the film industry calendar and a magnet for film-makers, journalists and hopefuls from across the globe. This year's event has a significant British presence, with films from Mike Leigh and Ken Loach in contention for the prestigious Palme d'Or award and several other titles showcased in other areas of the programme. The BBC's Neil Smith is on the French Riviera and will be posting regular updates on this year's festivities. In all fairness, John's more recent output has not matched up to those earlier career highlights. But the 81-year-old keeps plugging away and was back at Cannes this year with a follow-up of sorts to his 1987 film Hope and Glory. Queen and Country, like its predecessor, draws on Boorman's own past for inspiration. Yet while Hope and Glory looked at growing up in London during World War II, his latest jumps forward to the early 1950s, when he did his national service. What follows is a nostalgic vision of a more innocent England that made me feel a little homesick when I saw it on Tuesday, for all its slight clunkiness and Carry On Sergeant-style humour. Some people, Sir Michael Caine among them, are of the opinion that the youth of today would benefit from a  . Boorman is not dismissive of that view, though he does offer caveats on what form that service should take. \"The people who say [it should be brought back] feel it gives you discipline, makes you into a man and all that. The problem is it wouldn't really have a purpose,\" he says. \"The reason they brought it in was that Britain had garrisons all over the world - in Egypt, Malaya, Kenya and Malta - and they had to be manned. \"War today is much more specialised, the army is more technological, and robots are being developed so you won't really need soldiers at all. \"National Service would perhaps be a good thing, but not for the purpose of making soldiers. Were it to come back for a different and better purpose - like the Peace Corps in America, where they send the youth out to underdeveloped countries - there would be a reason for it.\" Having made films since the 1960s, Boorman has worked with a host of stars from Lee Marvin and Burt Reynolds to Pierce Brosnan, Brendan Gleason and TV's Kim Cattrall. Queen and Country, however, sees him marshalling a more fresh-faced, less experienced ensemble. Which does he find the easier? \"When I had my first child, I developed a theory about bringing up children,\" the director says by way of explanation. \"But when I had my second, I found I had to adapt and modify that theory. \"By the time I had four children\" - he has seven in all, among them actor and documentary-maker Charley - \"I gave up theory altogether. \"It's the same with actors. I used to have theories about how to deal with them, until I realised they are all different. \"They all need different things from me and different approaches.\" Boorman has a wealth of anecdotes and insights that makes any time spent in his company a pleasure. He also has robust views about Britain's class system and its royal family that suggests there probably won't be a knighthood heading his way, not that he'd be likely to accept it. All in all, meeting him was as good a way as any to round off nine hectic, eventful and exhilarating days at the world's biggest and craziest film festival. I'll leave you with this photo of myself on the steps of the Palais. Next time I'm up there, I hope to be wearing a tuxedo. The long road that took that movie to Oscar glory in 2012 began the previous year at Cannes, the first festival to embrace the French director's affectionate homage to silent cinema. This time, alas, Cannes may prove something of a dead end, judging by the half-hearted applause and audible boos that greeted his remake of a 1948 film of the same title. There were even a few jeering whistles during this morning's press screening, suggesting some critics had made their mind up on its merits long before the end credits. Set in the aftermath of World War II, the original Search saw Montgomery Clift as an American soldier who set out to reunite a lost Czech boy with his mother. Hazanavicius updates the story to 1999 and the second Chechen War, using the plight of an orphaned nine-year-old refugee as a far-from-subtle symbol of the West's widespread indifference to the conflict. Berenice Bejo - aka Mrs Hazanavicius - plays an EU delegate who takes the boy under her wing while trying to alert Strasbourg to the carnage on its doorstep. Meanwhile, a young Russian private finds soldiering is not what it is cracked up to be, setting up a climactic twist you do not have to be psychic to see coming. Earnest, mawkish and punishingly slow, this two-and-a-half hour slog boasts some impressive battle sequences but feels like one long preach to the already converted. It's the last film I will see during my stint in Cannes, and one that sadly confirms my overall impression that this has been far from a vintage year. Only in Cannes can you get a critical pasting one minute and a standing ovation the next. That was the lot of Canadian actor Ryan Gosling on Tuesday, the day his directorial debut was unveiled to expectant festival audiences. The 33-year-old star of Drive and The Notebook appeared genuinely humbled to be given such a high-profile launching pad for his film Lost River. \"It's a huge honour to be invited here,\" he told the audience last night. \"It's an incredible opportunity to show a film in a theatre like this.\" Long before Gosling mounted the Debussy Theatre's steps with cast members Christina Hendricks and Matt Smith, however, the word was out that the RyGo was a no-no. \" \", \" \", \" \" and \" \" were just some of the adjectives used to describe a drama generally felt to be overly indebted to the likes of David Lynch, Terrence Malick and Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn. While some reviewers gave Gosling credit for his ambition, just as many said he had overreached himself on his first stint behind the camera. Back at the Debussy, none of that seemed to matter to an largely enthusiastic crowd happy to bask in the actor's reflected glory. It made me wonder what one has to do not to get a standing ovation at Cannes. Hmm... not be a Hollywood A-lister maybe? Lost River was originally named How to Catch a Monster, a rather more evocative title than the bland one it has now. Then again, the title is the least of its problems. Rather more pressing is the overall lack of coherence and a story that's deathly dull even when it's trying to be intensely perverse. Set in a ruined city clearly modelled on Detroit, it tells of a single mother (Mad Men actress Hendricks) who takes a job in a nightclub to make ends meet. Little does she know her position requires her to participate in kinky sexual role-plays, often at the behest of her manipulative financial advisor (Ben Mendelsohn). Meanwhile, the oldest of her two sons (Iain De Caestecker) falls on the wrong side of local thug Bully after thieving on his patch. The villain is played by Smith as a hollering Looney Tune capable of extreme acts of violence - a role the actor shaved his head for shortly after leaving Doctor Who last year. The combined star wattage of Gosling and Smith should help Lost River find an audience when it is released in the UK later this year. For now though, it's already been chalked up as another of this Cannes Film Festival's high-profile disappointments. I'd heard such good things about Whiplash from when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January that I was worried it wouldn't live up to my high expectations. To my delight it did, and more. Not only is Damien Chazelle's music-based drama the best thing I've seen at Cannes, I already suspect it will be the best film I'll see all year. Set in New York, it tells of a budding jazz drummer (Miles Teller) who comes under the tutelage of a dictatorial martinet of a music teacher (JK Simmons). Imagine the drill instructors from Full Metal Jacket, An Officer and a Gentleman and Aliens rolled into one and you're still nowhere close to this ruthless, foul-mouthed tyrant. The jazz is sensational, the editing astonishing and it all climaxes on a musical high so extraordinary you can only applaud. (And trust me, you will.) Teller is fabulous but this is Simmons' film - and a just reward after many years of selfless supporting roles in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies and others. \"No one can make the word [expletive] sound as good as JK,\" said Chazelle after Tuesday's directors' fortnight screening. \"There are some people who can curse really well and create poetry out of very coarse language. \"He was the only person in American film today who could sell it both comically and dramatically and give it the right rhythm I needed.\" \"I will confess there are aspects of Terence Fletcher with which I empathise,\" said Simmons of a role I can easily see landing him his first Oscar nomination. If this sounds like extravagant praise, I assure you it is not. Whiplash hasn't got a confirmed release date in the UK yet, but you should definitely seek it out when it does. Belgian siblings Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne are two-time winners of the Palme d'Or, so it is no surprise to see them in competition again this year.  Yet where 1999's Rosetta and 2005's The Child both told stories of the struggling underclass, Two Days, One Night tries something different by turning its gaze on the more rarefied concerns of Belgium's aspirant middle-classes.  Marion Cotillard plays Sandra, an employee at a solar panel factory who learns she will lose her job unless her co-workers opt to give up a \u20ac1,000 bonus.  Over the course of one weekend, she visits each of them in turn in the hope of pricking their collective social consciousnesses with her personal tale of woe. The film echoes the work of Britain's Ken Loach with its earnest call for solidarity in the workplace and its barely concealed disgust at how employers divide and rule their underlings.  But the Dardennes rather tip the scales by having Sandra also plagued by marital difficulties and a history of depression that is used rather cynically to sway the audience's sympathies.  Cotillard is great as ever and is surely a strong contender for this year's best actress award with a performance of dignity, grit and tenacity.  Sadly, there is only so much drama to be found in her making the same plaintive argument over and over again, resulting in a film that's more repetitive than revealing and feels considerably longer than its 95-minute running time. Speaking of professional solidarity, the lights came up at the Grand Theatre Lumiere on a furious row on the rights and wrongs of using one's mobile phone during an early morning press screening.  I wouldn't expect many tears to be shed should the inconsiderate miscreant responsible find himself facing redundancy any time soon. After a blisteringly warm weekend, locals and visitors alike in Cannes woke up on Monday morning to wet and windy weather that persisted all the way to nightfall. I shudder to think how many beach bashes were wash-outs as a result of conditions which sent many festival-goers taking shelter inside whatever cinema could accommodate them. I followed suit after fulfilling my press conference duties, catching three films back-to-back which proves how much variety is on offer at this south of France shindig. I started my triple bill with Bird People, a whimsical French film playing in the Un Certain Regard part of the official programme. Set in and around a hotel at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, Pascale Ferran's curio tells a pair of complementary stories that share themes of ennui, alienation and disenchantment with modern society. In the first more conventional half, a San Jose businessman (Josh Charles from US TV series The Good Wife) decides on a whim to quit his job, abandon his family and start a new life in Europe. In the second more fanciful section, a young maid named Audrey (Anais Demoustier) is miraculously turned into a sparrow and spends a joyous night flying around the airport's runways and terminals. Given the likelihood of it being crushed underfoot or sucked into a jet engine, you'd think an airport would be the last place any self-respecting sparrow would choose to frequent. After watching Welcome to New York the other night though, I was only happy Audrey didn't go in to clean a hotel room and find Gerard Depardieu emerging priapically from the shower. I've been somewhat remiss on the documentary front this festival - an oversight I sought to address by catching a screening of Caricaturistes (Cartoonists in English). Directed by Stephanie Valloatto, this out of competition offering meets 12 \"dessinateurs\" from around the world who have all encountered resistance to their political satire and lampooning of the powerful. The film's subtitle proclaims them to be \"Foot Soldiers of Democracy\" who do a noble job holding their leaders to account and, when required, cutting them down to size. Zipping between South America, the Middle East and various other locales, it's an interesting, thought-provoking watch. I would have thought that our own Gerald Scarfe deserved a mention though. My final catch of the day was When Animals Dream, a Danish horror set in a remote fishing community that reminded me a lot of the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In. Where that film's young female heroine was a vampire, this one's is a werewolf whose hairy makeover is triggered by her sexual awakening. \"I'm about to turn into a monster, but first I need a lot of sex. Are you able to help me?\" asks Marie (Rooney Mara-alike Sonia Suhl) of one victim in waiting. It's all rather formulaic but I still found it enjoyable - not least for having Lars Mikkelsen, brother of my mate Mads, as part of its cast. Today is my last full day in Cannes and there is a lot going on. Keep checking back in over the next 24 hours, when I will hopefully have news on the new film from the Dardenne brothers, John Boorman's sequel to Hope and Glory and Ryan Gosling's eagerly anticipated directorial debut. Phew! What does a world-famous director do with all the glittering trophies he accumulates over the course of his long career? If you're Canadian film-maker David Cronenberg, you use them in your work as murder weapons. At a press conference on Monday for his new film Maps to the Stars, the 71-year-old horror maestro revealed he gave the golden Genie award he won for 2002 film Spider a cameo role - as a blunt instrument used by one character to bludgeon another to death. \"It was a personal touch,\" the silver-haired auteur joked, going on to recall that the statuette had got bent in the process. Robert Pattinson was also in a sharing mood, telling journalists that his on-screen sex scene with co-star Julianne Moore had been \"a wonderful experience\" - albeit an \"extremely sweaty\" one. The 28-year-old is making a habit of simulating sex in limousines, having also been intimate with Juliette Binoche in Cronenberg's earlier film Cosmopolis. So who was the better partner, he was inevitably asked?  \"Both are, like, sevens,\" he answered charitably. Foxcatcher tells the strange but troublingly true story of an Olympic gold medal-winning wrestler; the older brother who coached him to glory; and the wealthy heir who came between them and changed their lives forever.  It boasts a completely atypical, dead-straight turn from comedy star Steve Carrell, a remarkably physical one from Channing Tatum and a dramatic conclusion you should ideally discover for yourselves.  Director Bennett Miller previously enjoyed great success with Capote and Moneyball and looks set to be in the running for awards again with this compelling and unusual sports-based drama.  If nothing else, Foxcatcher surely deserves a prize for best supporting nose for the astonishing fake proboscis Carell sports in his role as inscrutable billionaire philanthropist John du Pont. At a press conference held after this morning's first screening, Carell said his approach to the role had been no different from his more familiar comic parts.  \"The characters don't know if they're in a comedy or a drama,\" shrugged the Anchorman man. \"So I didn't approach it as a drama - just as a story.\"  Meanwhile, his co-star Mark Ruffalo - who plays wrestling coach Dave Schultz - had this to say on the film's key themes. \"There's a Greek tragedy buried in the film. What happens when everything has a price tag and everything is for sale? What happens to talent when it can be acquired for a price, and what happens to the people within that system?  \"These are very talented people who can't do what they do best unless they can find a way to monetise it. And that costs them a great deal.\"  Foxcatcher is up for the Palme d'Or and will be out in the UK later this year.  Its title, by the way, refers to the wrestling team Carell's character forms in the hope of seeing Tatum mount the podium at the 1988 Seoul Olympics Two years ago David Cronenberg and Robert Pattinson came to Cannes with Cosmopolis, an odd film in which the latter spent virtually all of his time inside a stretch limousine. Now the duo are back, and so is the limo, in Palme d'Or hopeful Maps to the Stars. This time though, Pattinson is driving the car instead of riding in it. In truth, the actor's role as a chauffeur with ambitions to better his station is a fairly minor one in this dark Hollywood satire. But he does get to romance Mia Wasikowska, the new girl in town whose facial burns hint at a tragic personal history. Mia gets a job as an assistant - the phrase used here is \"chore whore\" - to Julianne Moore's narcissistic star, a fading leading lady desperate to return to the big time. Moore's is a pretty despicable character in a caustic vision of Tinseltown that is sure to strike a chord with many of this year's festival attendees. To my mind, Maps to the Stars begins to lose its way once it stops taking the movie industry to task and becomes a hallucinatory psychodrama about creeping insanity. This may well be a minority opinion though. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw   in his four-star review, while the Telegraph's Robbie Collin believes   the festival's highest honour. The film, which also features John Cusack and Olivia Williams as the parents of a Bieber-esque child actor (Evan Bird), has its official press conference and gala premiere later. Two days on, I still find myself thinking of Eric Cantona's performance in The Salvation, that gritty western I saw on Friday. What made the Danish director Kristian Levring cast the former soccer player, a man still best-known in the UK for his karate kicks and gnomic, seagull-related utterances?  \"Eric can act,\" grins the burly Dane. \"Not many footballers can act, but Eric can. \"I'm also a Manchester United fan, so to work with 'King Eric'... well, you don't get to do that too many times in your life.\" \"Eric is special,\" the film-maker continues. \"I mean, I love [Lionel] Messi, but I wouldn't have him in my film.\" \"Cantona is an idol,\" agrees The Salvation's star, former Bond villain Mads Mikkelsen. \"All male actors wanted to be soccer players before they became actors, so we were all very excited when he came.\" Speaking of westerns, there's another one having its Cannes premiere tonight. Tommy Lee Jones directs and stars alongside Hilary Swank in The Homesman, a film I hope to catch up with before I mosey on home on Wednesday. Two manic media scrums in the space of 12 hours is two too many for this reporter. But that's what I and my colleagues faced, first at the Welcome to New York screening last night and then at the   earlier today. The former was held in a giant tent on the beach, with a loud and exuberant party taking place a stone's throw away. I joked to director Abel Ferrara as I left around midnight that perhaps every post-screening Q&A at Cannes should be held in a nightclub. I experienced a journalistic nightmare this lunchtime when I realised to my horror that I had left my notepad at the Carlton Hotel after the Expendables press conference. Hot-footing it back along the Croisette, I found it exactly where I left it - which says something about either the commendable honesty of the international press corps or the woeful illegibility of my handwriting. I'll just say a word here about It Follows, a creepy and creative US horror film that I caught on Saturday afternoon. Playing as part of the Critics' Week sidebar, it's an inventive and unsettling piece about a teenage girl who finds herself inheriting a curse after a one night stand. Finding herself pursued by a shape-shifting zombie stalker, Jay (Maika Monroe) realises that the only way to save her skin is to pass it on to her next sexual partner. Zombies are usually a metaphor for something in movies. Here, it seems they represent the dangers of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. One of the quirkier attractions of Cannes is the Palm Dog, a tongue-in-cheek awards ceremony that celebrates canine performers at the festival. Decided by a panel of UK film critics, the awards have previously recognised the likes of Uggie in The Artist, Dug from the Pixar animation Up, and the titular lead in The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby. There are a number of mutts in The Rover, a thriller set in the Australian Outback starring Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson. To be honest, though, I'm not sure if its title refers to a dog, Pearce himself or the stolen automobile his taciturn loner spends all of David Michod's film trying to recover. Pattinson plays a stammering, twitchy simpleton with close-cropped hair and terrible teeth who joins Pearce on his obsessive quest. It's a bold volte face for the British star that seems a deliberate attempt to put some distance between himself and the Twilight series for which he is best known. The real star of The Rover, however, is the Outback itself - an arid, dusty and forbidding environment in which bad things happen constantly and no one is to be trusted. Released in the UK this August, The Rover is playing out of competition and has its gala premiere later.  Mike Leigh had some sharp words - and a two-fingered salute - to the \"Turner-aks\" who might object to how JMW Turner is portrayed in his new film about the painter. \"The real Turner nuts haven't seen it yet,\" he told an audience at the UK Film tent this afternoon. \"But we've already ordered some protective armour. \"There are bound to be some complainers,\" the director continued. \"But they can [expletive] off.\" As I departed the event, who should I see but Donald Sutherland and Julianne Moore walking out of an adjacent marquee. Wherever you are, you're never too far from a star at the Cannes Film Festival. Ugly Betty star America Ferrara looked radiant last night at the beach party for How to Train a Dragon 2 in a billowing, beaded white gown. Earlier in the evening, though, she and that gown were the victims of a rather unsavoury stunt as she posed with her fellow voice stars on the Cannes red carpet. A Ukrainian prankster thought it would be funny if he stuck his head under the 30-year-old actress's dress while she was turned towards photographers. The man, who apparently makes a habit of placing celebrities in awkward situations, was pounced upon by security guards and swiftly ejected. Before the Dragon 2 event, I returned to the tent where I'd   earlier on Friday to watch singer Tony Hadley perform a brief acoustic set with guitarist Steve Norman. Their performance ended with a lusty rendition of the anthemic track Gold that all assembled, myself included, had great fun singing along to as the sun set. Mads Mikkelsen as a barefoot cowboy. Eva Green as a vengeful mute. Eric Cantona as a gun-toting Old West heavy. Yes, it is fair to say Kristian Levring's bloody western The Salvation has one of the more unusual casts to be found in this year's festival programme. I knew I was in for a violent morning from the first 10 minutes, during which Mads' Danish war veteran turned frontier settler loses both his wife and young son to a couple of stagecoach-hijacking scoundrels. Needless to say, these are far from the only corpses to be found in a beautifully shot saga of revenge and retribution that even comes with its own undertaker (Jonathan Pryce). The Salvation is screening out of competition. Were it to be in the running, though, it would have a much better chance of taking home the Palme d'Or than, say, Atom Egoyan's The Captive. As it is, the film will have a \"seance special\" on Saturday at half past midnight. Personally, I think I'll be tucked up in bed by then. There was more blood and thunder this lunchtime from British stalwarts Film 4, who treated a select group of journalists to a \"sizzle reel\" of its upcoming projects. It included a tantalising glimpse of Michael Fassbender in Macbeth, which on this evidence looks to be Shakespeare spliced liberally with Mel Gibson's Braveheart. The Fass sports a hedge of face fur and a physiognomy smeared with mud in what is shaping up to be a highly visceral and intense take on the Bard's Scottish tragedy. Is this a hit I see before me? I wouldn't be surprised. Lady M, for the record, is played by France's Marion Cotillard, who will be seen later this festival in competition entry Two Days, One Night. Animation has the stigma of being just for the kids\u201d Every Cannes Film Festival boasts at least one potential Hollywood blockbuster in its line-up - perhaps to prove that, for all its focus on the high-brow and art-house, it still has time for what audiences tend to spend their money on. This year, that slot is filled by How to Train Your Dragon 2, the latest animation from the DreamWorks stable that brought the likes of Kung Fu Panda, Puss in Boots and A Shark Tale to previous events. DreamWorks has a tradition of mounting elaborate photo opportunities to promote its wares - flanking Jack Black with an army of pandas for example, or putting Jerry Seinfeld on a zip wire in a bee costume. This year the tradition was maintained by having the voice stars of the film pose beside a local stooge, sweltering inside an outsized dragon costume. One can only hope he was paid to scale (ho ho). DreamWorks Animation will celebrate its 20th anniversary later this year - one reason why How to Train Your Dragon 2 has been invited to screen outside of competition. According to its director and writer, however, animation has more than earned its place at this annual celebration of international auteur film-making. \"I constantly think that animation is gaining ground, not only in terms of worldwide appreciation but also within the industry itself,\" Dean DeBlois told me yesterday. \"The sophisticated, film-going snobs are beginning to see some of the potential within the medium. \"Too often, particularly in north America, animation has the stigma of being just for the kids. I think it's a medium that can speak to a much bigger audience than that. \"Hopefully that's coming across to the film-making community at large. Just because it's an animated film, it shouldn't be relegated to the kiddie table.\" The last time I saw Ryan Reynolds on screen was at the Sundance London Film Festival. It was a film called The Voices, and he was playing a schizophrenic serial killer who took orders from his speaking cat.  If anything, The Captive - the Cannes competition entry in which he appears - is even more preposterous. Reynolds plays the father of a kidnapped child who has spent eight years trying to track her down with the help of a police detective, played by Rosario Dawson.  What follows is a lurid hotchpotch of sophisticated paedophiles and hi-tech criminality that drew a jeering response at the end of this morning's press screening. I'd been hoping for more from Canadian director Atom Egoyan. Like many others though, I left disappointed. Here's hoping the rest of the day pans out better. I spent part of today on the seventh floor of Cannes' famous Carlton Hotel, doing some interviews I'll tell you more about tomorrow ... For now, here is a snap of me hard at work on the balcony, just to prove that I'm here. The festival is in full swing after last night's gala opening, with no sign of the rain that put something of a dampener on things on Tuesday and Wednesday. There's precious little time, then, to top up one's tan, for all the apparent evidence to the contrary. As I write stars are arriving at the Grand Theatre Lumiere for the Mr Turner premiere, among them Julianne Moore. The US actress will be back on the red carpet on Monday for Maps to the Stars, the David Cronenberg film in which she has a starring role. \"Nothing exists in isolation,\" says a character in Mr Turner, Mike Leigh's affecting portrait of the 19th century English artist Joseph Mallord William Turner. The film takes this observation to heart, showing its subject as a gifted yet flawed man whose genius springs out of his relationship to his society, surroundings and relationships, particularly with women. There are actually two Mister Turners here - Timothy Spall as the artist, and Paul Jesson as his father, a former barber whose decline and death foreshadows Turner's own. For this is a film as interested in mortality as the immortality that Turner now enjoys, through the art he bequeathed to the nation and the prize that bears his name. Leigh shows the artist at work: Sketching obsessively, daubing feverishly and occasionally using his spittle as a paint thinner. Yet he also depicts him as man of baser instincts, who is not above seducing a needy widow or groping his housekeeper - a shuffling, almost Dickensian dogsbody memorably portrayed by Dorothy Atkinson. Around them circulate what seems like a who's who of Victorian notables - artist John Constable, critic John Ruskin and even Queen Victoria herself. Yet it is Spall who dominates as a cantankerous, grumpy curmudgeon capable of expressing a wealth of emotion in a single, exasperated grunt. Some will find Mr Turner somewhat leisurely, if not downright slow. Like Topsy Turvy before it, though, it shows Leigh to be as adept at chronicling real lives as he is at depicting fictional ones. Director of photography Dick Pope, meanwhile, does a grand job at recreating the images that inspired Turner, notably the Fighting Temeraire - a picture of a once great ship being towed away for scrap that recently made a cameo in the James Bond film Skyfall. Throw a stick in Cannes and you are more than likely to hit somebody with a connection to the film industry. A nice American woman asked me for directions to the Palais de Festivals this morning. In return, I got a five-minute pitch about the World War 2 film she has written, co-directed, starred in and in town to promote. Oh, and the man who buttonholed me on yesterday's flight over from Gatwick to advertise the virtues of East Grinstead as a potential movie location.  Now that's dedication. The critics have not been kind to Grace of Monaco, with one British reviewer going so far as to term it  . Having had the chance to see the film in London last week, I have to say I have a similarly low opinion of Olivier Dahan's soapy biopic. Little rings true in this melodramatic endeavour, least of all Sir Derek Jacobi as an expert in protocol who becomes Henry Higgins to Nicole Kidman's fair princess. Kidman herself does her best to put flesh on Grace's bones. Unfortunately, she brings too much of her own celebrity baggage to convince as an icon from another era. What can't be faulted, though, is the film's lavish costume and production design. It truly is a feast for the eyes with its fine gowns and expensive jewellery. And I have to confess that I rather enjoyed Tim Roth's turn as a largely silent, perpetually chain-smoking Prince Rainier. When I spoke to the British actor last year, he had this to say about playing Grace's husband: \"There's not much out there about Rainier. People don't have much of a perception about him, so we had a pretty free rein. \"But we wanted some toughness in him because he was known to be a very tough guy. He was very smart politically and could be very tough in a room. \"He fought in a war and was quite handy and he was a very shrewd businessman. So he was an interesting character to play, with a very funny moustache!\" The actor was somewhat bemused at the film's press conference earlier when he was asked if he had ever been tempted to hit his co-star during shooting. More than one eyebrow was raised when Grace of Monaco was chosen to be the opening night film at Cannes this year. French director Olivier Dahan and US producer Harvey Weinstein have been at loggerheads for months over the film's final cut, prompting the latter to remove it from its release schedule and,  , consider dumping it altogether. Monaco's royal family, meanwhile, has greeted the film's dramatisation of Grace Kelly's transition from Hollywood star to Monegasque princess with withering disdain, declaring its story to be \" \". The film has its gala premiere later. Before that, though, the critics will have their say. The reviews are expected around noon Cannes time, once this morning's official press screening is over. Looking ahead, the festival's organisers have announced this year's event will close in 11 days with a special screening of Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. Quentin Tarantino will host the 24 May celebration of the 1964 classic, one of the first \"spaghetti westerns\" and the film that made Clint Eastwood an international star. In the meantime, normal service has resumed on the weather front: balmy temperatures, blazing sunshine and cloudless, azure skies. Perfect, in other words, for sitting in darkened rooms for hours on end watching one film after another. In my experience, sun can usually be guaranteed at the Cannes Film Festival. Yet new arrivals on the Croisette today were greeted by buffeting gusts, sharp showers and glowering clouds more reminiscent of a wet weekend in Margate. Here's hoping it's just the storm before the calm. With the festival kicking off tomorrow, the atmosphere is one of nervous excitement and frantic, last-minute preparations. I trust they'll get round to laying a red carpet on the steps of the Grand Theatre Lumiere, which, at the moment, look rather naked without it. Yet, they have found time to drape the usual, enormous billboards over the hotel frontages that overlook the Mediterranean. The Carlton, for example, has massive representations of Sylvester Stallone, Harrison Ford and other cast members from The Expendables 3 ahead of their planned visit this weekend. Other displays bang the drum for Angelina Jolie's Maleficent, the new Transformers film and the next entry in the Hunger Games franchise. The one that caught my eye, though, is for a film called Awol 72, an action thriller starring Luke Goss of Bros fame. According to the poster tagline, \"Running is the only option\". Well, I suppose that's one way of putting it. ",

        "article": "As the British Library puts huge swathes of writers' and poets' personal archives online on their   site, including papers from Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy and Charles Dickens, novelist Lawrence Norfolk looks at the significance of the notebook to a writer.  The first page of my notebook holds a column of place names, some cuneiform letters taken from a tomb in the British Library and a collection of oddly-named English meadow flowers (wet-the-bed, yellow rattle, adder's tongue fern).  Turning the page, I find a list of books with library numbers from the British or London libraries, then caravan names (Sprite, Lunar, the Senator range) then some players of un-credited guitar solos: Eric Clapton on When my Guitar Gently Weeps, Brian May on a Black Sabbath track, a few others. Turning to the back, I write the word Letter. I am travelling on a German train between Hannover and Osnabruck. Letter is the name of the station through which I have just passed.  The next is Haste. I write that too. What, I wonder, if the name of every station on the line turns out to be cognate with English words? What if the stations form a sentence? A paragraph? Unfortunately, the next station is Gummer. A writer's notebook is a junkyard; a junkyard of the mind. In this repository of failed attempts, different inks speak of widely-spaced times and places, the diverse scrawls of varying levels of calligraphic awkwardness, lack of firm writing-surfaces, different modes of transportation.  All the places a good idea might blossom into something bigger and better.  No writer should believe in serendipity. All of us do. Thomas Hardy kept 'literary notebooks', a 'Poetical Matter' notebook and a 'Studies, Specimens, etc' notebook. But the richest to my mind is one with the bare title, 'Facts'.  Here Hardy and his first wife, Emma, noted down incidents culled from local newspapers. One entry (barely three lines long) is headed Sale of Wife. Out of that fragment came The Mayor of Casterbridge.  Of course, almost everything else in the Facts notebook resulted in nothing at all. A notebook is an act of triage on the world outside. A little 'fact' goes a long way in fiction. My German train slides past the backs of factories, blocks of flats and houses. Heading out into the countryside, I see two imposing hills.  Halfway up the nearest slope, a large statue stands within a structure that resembles an ancient Greek bandstand.  The statue will be some comically-obscure German official. The Elector-Palatinate of Gummer perhaps. I note down the nearest station and make a bad ink-sketch of the bandstand. Then I arrive at Osnabruck. Franz Kafka wrote in quarto-sized notebooks before trading down to octavo near the end of his life. Jean-Jacques Rousseau made notes on playing cards during walks that were later written up as his Reveries of a Solitary Walker.  I make notes on library slips, envelopes, junk mail, whatever's lying about. All these scraps end up shoved into notebooks.  I'm not particular about brands (the moleskin is high-end for me), only size, specifically whether they require a pocket or a bag, and how much I can get on one page.  The research for my book Lempriere's Dictionary was written in spiral-bound shorthand notepads, filled with notes on classical mythology, late eighteenth century newspaper reports, clothes descriptions, weather reports, ship catalogues, details of the siege of La Rochelle and early automata.  Later I switched to larger format books. These were between A4 and A3 size and the obvious drawback was portability but I lugged these volumes back and forth to libraries nevertheless.  At first I simply jotted stuff down as before but gradually I noticed that my note-taking had changed. With this new expanse of space, certain pages would take on their own momentum.  A map of Himmelbett German radar stations began life as research for a scene in which a German World War II night-fighter pilot flies his newly-delivered Messerschmitt Bf-109 E-series (an Emil in the slang of the time) down the coast of Holland, accidentally setting off alerts among the different Himmelbett radar stations which monitored the coast against English bombers.  These stations divided the airspace into sectors of operation (or boxes) which were code-named for different animals and fish. I had in mind a German fighter pilot flying through an airborne zoo.  I collected these box code-names from the memoirs of German night-fighter pilots who would routinely refer to flying and making contact in Lobster or Oyster or Polar Bear.  Then I collated these references on a map to discover which box the particular creature referred to.  I never wrote the scene. But long after I'd abandoned the idea, I was still collecting Himmelbett box code-names and fitting them into my plan.  Similar projects (in the same book) include a table (eventually, several tables) of the sound shifts which mark stages in the development of Middle High German, plans for a radio transmitter using only technology available in the fourth century AD and a catalogue (still being compiled) of books which once existed but now have vanished. No sensible writer intends projects like these. At the same time, no writer using a notebook can guard fully against them. They just happen.  A notebook accumulates its value slowly, line by line and page by page. Like Hardy's Wife for Sale, who knows what will prove a dead-end and what the inspiration or material for a book?  A detail jotted down in two minutes might occupy you for the next three years. The protagonist of your next book might turn out to be the Elector-Palatinate of Gummer.  A full notebook potentially contains the rest of your writing life. Or nothing of value at all. It is transitional. Work passes through it on the way to becoming something else.  I used the caravan list in a short story about two lovers not quite falling apart during an impromptu visit to Little Rollright (the easternmost stone circle in Britain, also from the notebook). The un-credited guitar soloists went into that story too.  Of the remainder, I don't know. Not the railway station names anyway. And I never found the identity of the statue, the Elector-Palatinate or whoever he was. I got off at Osnabruck. I left the notebook on the train. ",
