Users must be 18 years old and are required to fill in an online form in order to be eligible to buy the device. The eyewear will cost $1,500 (\u00a3894) and the BBC understands UK developers may have access as early as May. The high price will be likely to deter many enthusiasts, who may be forced to wait for price reductions. The tech giant sold the device to 8,000 individuals in 2013 as part of their Explorer programme.

Until now access to the internet has been via dial-up or satellite links. Earlier this year, 3G mobile phone services were cut off because of a threat from Islamist militants. The al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab group issued a directive in January ordering all internet services to be stopped, saying those who did not comply would be seen as \"working with the enemy\" and dealt with according to Islamic law. Al-Shabab was driven out of the capital, Mogadishu, in August 2011, but still controls many smaller towns and rural areas in the south and centre of the country where they have imposed a strict version of Sharia. Following their threat, 3G networks nationwide were turned off but the project to launch fibre optic cable services continued in the capital, the BBC's Moalimu Mohammed reports from Mogadishu. He says the fibre optic connections, which have been rolled out over the last week by several internet providers, are only available in Mogadishu. People have been flocking to hotels and internet cafes to try out the fast service - some seeing video platforms like YouTube and social networking sites for the first time, our correspondent says. Mr Egal said the difference in speed was like the difference between \"day and night\". For those residents who have recently returned from the diaspora the development was a relief, he said. It was \"almost a culture shock\" for those who have never left Somalia, he added. He said the move would be a huge boost for the country, which is recovering from more than two decades of civil war. \"Every time a fibre optic cable is connected to a country they see their GDP [gross domestic product] going up because their communication costs go down,\" Mr Egal said. \"All life will be affected - businesses, the government, universities - they all will see the benefits.\"  Our reporter says the current security situation will limit the rollout of fibre optic services to the rest of the country. Since 1991 Somalia has seen clan-based warlords, rival politicians and Islamist militants battle for control - a situation that has allowed lawlessness to flourish. An African Union force has been helping the UN-backed government fight al-Shabab, which wants to create an Islamic state in Somalia. ",

        "article": "Google is taking a stake in a Silicon Valley-based robotics company that has yet to reveal its first product. Savioke's work may be under wraps, but it   to begin customer trials of a service industry-targeted machine this year. Google has acquired eight other robotics companies outright over the past year. Its latest investment may be relatively small but experts say that it should boost confidence in the sector. Savioke has disclosed a total $2m (\u00a31.2m) of seed finance, which includes cash from other sources in addition to an undisclosed sum from Google Ventures, the search giant's investment arm. Savioke was only established last year. However, its chief executive, Steve Cousins, has previous experience in the sector, having launched the PR2 robot - a machine targeted at robotics software developers wishing to try out their code. \"We have decided that it is time for robots to become available widely in the service industry,\" Mr Cousins told the BBC. \"We're not ready to quite disclose what we are going to be doing, but we believe the technology is ripe and this industry is largely untapped. \"There's a few examples of robots in hospitals that are extensions of a surgeon, but what we are looking at is a little bit more what people traditionally think of as robots - autonomous entities that can do things on their own and can help people out.\" Although he declined to say which sectors would be targeted,   lists hotels, elderly care facilities, hospitals and restaurants as possibilities. Mr Cousins was keen to stress that the deal involved Google Ventures - a unit that operates independently of the rest of the California-based company and whose stated goal is to fund the \"best companies\" rather than ones that are strategic to Google's other operations. However, GV's previous stake in Nest ultimately resulted in Google paying $3.2bn to add the smart thermostat-maker to its main business, and Mr Cousins did not rule out the possibility of his company following a similar path. \"In the end, what we want to see is robots out in the world helping people,\" he said. \"So, whatever 'exit strategy' leads us to that goal is what we are all about.\" Google's interest in robotics was preceded by that of Amazon.  The web retailer paid $775m in 2012 to buy Kiva Systems, a company specialising in robots used to move goods in warehouses. Venture capitalists said the two big companies actions' were now fuelling interest from others. \"One of the big questions when you do a robotics deal had always been who is going to buy it if this thing doesn't go public,\" said tech investor Paul Kedrosky.  \"It was never obvious. Now that Amazon and Google have self-identified as acquirers, it makes doing robotics deals pretty exciting.\" Mike Maples, co-founder of Floodgate Ventures, agreed the sector had become more attractive. \"In the last few years, it has become clear that the computer industry is no longer primarily about computers - whether it's post-PC devices, internet of things, self-driving cars, wearables or robots - an entirely new digital industry is emerging where computers fade into the background but digital is everywhere,\" he said. \"Google's move into robotics will make it even more attractive to start-up investors because it accelerates the creation of a new category of opportunities.\" British engineering company Dyson recently announced that it was investing \u00a35m in a robotics lab at Imperial College London. One roboticist said he expected more deals would follow. \"It's pretty clear that with an ageing population there is a fantastic business opportunity for creating technology that is not only going to improve people's quality of life but also extend their working lives,\" said Prof Chris Melhuish, director of Bristol Robotics Laboratory.

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) warned only Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and West Midlands had sufficient plans in place. It also found only 2% of police staff across 37 forces had been trained on investigating cybercrime. The report examined how prepared police are for a series of national threats. The capacity and capability of the police to respond to national threats is stronger in some areas than others\u201d Last year, the government identified five threats as priorities for police to prepare for. These are: As part of its Strategic Policing Requirement (SPR), the Home Office called for a nationally-required policing response to counter each of the threats. The report is the first in a series of inspections looking at how individual forces have responded to the guidelines. However, it found the response to national threats by individual forces has \"not changed appreciably\". HMIC inspectors said they were \"struck by how incomplete the police service's understanding of the national threats was\" and that more needs to be done \"collectively by all forces\". The report called for \"much greater attention\" from police leaders. \"The capacity and capability of the police to respond to national threats is stronger in some areas than others - with the police response to the cyber-threat being the least well developed,\" HMIC's Stephen Otter said. Police plans to deal with counter-terrorism, public order, civil emergencies and organised crime were in \"stark contrast\" with the capabilities for cyber-related threats. Inspectors found the ability to deal with cyber-threats remains \"largely absent\" in some forces and that some senior officers across England and Wales are still \"unsure of what constituted a large-scale cyber-incident\". The police must be able to operate very soon just as well in cyberspace as they do on the street\u201d They found forces were \"silent\" when it came to preventing cybercrime and protecting people from the harm it causes, despite the fact it is \"fast becoming a dominant method in the perpetration of crime. \"The police must be able to operate very soon just as well in cyberspace as they do on the street,\" the report said. According to the government's definition, a large-scale cyber-incident could be \"a criminal attack on a financial institution to gather data or money\" or an \"aggregated threat where many people or businesses across the UK are targeted\".  It also includes \"the response to a failure of technology on which communities depend and which may also be considered a civil emergency\".  The HMIC report covered police forces in England and Wales.  In Scotland, police have tried to tackle cybercrime by forming a \"cyber-resilience group\" with industry experts and academics, which aims to spread awareness of cybercrime and help businesses protect themselves.  Last year it was estimated cybercrime costs Scottish businesses \u00a35bn a year.  The Police Service of Northern Ireland has focused on protecting young people from the dangers of cybercrime aimed at individuals. Chief Constable Justine Curran, the national policing lead for public order at the Association of Chief Police Officers, said police had \"continued to improve\" and to \"develop our understanding of the threats we face\".  However, she said there was \"more to do to develop a clear, consistent approach,\" particularly when it comes to cybercrime, which she said remained \"a growing threat\". \"This report will assist chiefs and the College of Policing in this ongoing work and provide useful ideas for enhancement where this can be achieved within the current financial austerity across policing,\" she said.

Israeli start-up StoreDot displayed the device - made of biological structures - at Microsoft's Think Next Conference.  A Samsung S4 smartphone went from a dead battery to full power in 26 seconds in the demonstration. The battery is currently only a prototype and the firm predicts it will take three years to become a commercially viable product. In the demonstration, a battery pack the size of a cigarette packet was attached to a smartphone. \"We think we can integrate a battery into a smartphone within a year and have a commercially ready device in three years,\" founder Dr Dorn Myersdorf told the BBC. The bio-organic battery utilises tiny self-assembling nano-crystals that were first identified in research being done into Alzheimer's disease at Tel Aviv University 10 years ago. The nano-dots are  described by StoreDot as \"stable, robust spheres\" that are 2.1 nanometers in diameter and made up of peptide molecules. The technology has a range of uses,  founder Dr Myersdorf said. \"Batteries are just one of the industries we can disrupt with this new material. It is new physics, new chemistry, a new approach to devices,\" he said. The team has also used the nano-crystals in memory chips which could write three times faster than traditional flash memory and as a non-toxic alternative to cadmium in screens. Dr Myersdorf said that the batteries are likely to be 30 to 40% more expensive to manufacture compared to traditional ones and the final product will be twice as expensive than those on the market today. But making them should be a relatively easy process.  \"It is about letting nature take its course. We just need a facility that can do chemical processing,\" he said.  ",

Makers M3D have currently raised over $1m (\u00a3597,000) well ahead of their $50,000 target with 28 days to go. Early backers will get the machine for just $199 and other backers can pledge as little as $299.  Dubbed Micro, it comes with easy-to-use software that allows users to search, drag and drop objects to print. Kickstarter is a crowd-funding website that has breathed life into a range of technology projects, including the virtual reality headset Oculus Rift, which was subsequently bought by Facebook for $2bn. At just 7.3in (18.5cm) square and weighing 1kg (2.2lbs), the device will be easy to move around. It can be used with Windows, Mac or Linux. It comes with software that allows users to search and browse objects online. Once they have picked something they would like to print they drag it into the printer and hit print. \"It's our goal to make the Micro accessible to everyday users,\"  The tagline on its Kickstarter page calls it \"the first truly consumer 3D printer\". Some believe that it could be a game changer. \"Along with the market entry of New Kinpo I think it's one of the most interesting things to happen in desktop 3D printing,\" said expert Joris Peels. \"New price points and lower pricing will be key in getting people to buy a 3D printer. Not many people can afford to pay $2,000 for a printer but many more can try one for $500 or $300,\" he added. The team hope to be able to start shipping the machines in August.  While those supporting the device on Kickstarter will get it for $299 or below, a retail price has not yet been set although it is expected to be \"within the same price bracket\" according to a company spokeswoman.

Satellites of the GLONASS network experienced a half-day outage when bad data was uploaded to spacecraft.  map shows a GLONASS receiver at Harwich giving corrupted position fixes that were off by more than 50km. The Authorities say the 2 April event is a timely reminder that alternatives to satellite navigation are essential. The GLA themselves are supporting a system in the UK and Ireland called eLoran, which transmits long-range position, navigation and timing signals from a ground-based radio network. Its primary use is for ships and others in the maritime sector, but there is a feeling also that eLoran could provide a robust back-up for GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo when it arrives. Galileo is the European sat-nav system, which is in the process of roll-out. A   found that the UK was becoming dangerously over-reliant on what are termed Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Use of space-borne positioning and timing data is now widespread, in everything from freight movement to synchronisation of computer networks. The academy found that too few of these applications were able to lean on alternatives should the primary sat-nav signals go down. Receivers needed to be capable of switching seamlessly between a variety of data sources, the RAEng expert panel argued. \"GLONASS is used by quite a lot of people, actually; the iPhone-5 can pick up its signals,\" explained Prof David Last, a consultant engineer and past president of the Royal Institute of Navigation. \"What we saw last week was many people being affected by the GLONASS failure even with receivers that were also picking up GPS.   \"The lesson that comes out of this is not just that satellite-navigation systems are vulnerable, but that you don't get a protection by simply plugging in a second satellite-navigation system.   \"You need something that is different and doesn't share common modes of failure,\" he told BBC News.

        "article": "The Bradley Timepiece, a watch designed for blind people and named after a Paralympian gold medallist who lost his sight in Afghanistan, is up for design of the year at London's Design Museum. But it's mostly being bought by sighted people, writes Chris Stokel-Walker. The watch has a stark, circular titanium face. There are no hands. There are no numbers. Around a groove in the centre a ball-bearing rotates to mark the minutes. Around the edge of the watch, another ball bearing rotates to tell the hours.  The Bradley was designed for the use of blind people, the latest in a long line of efforts to help those without sight efficiently tell the time. Designer Hyungsoo Kim was in a lecture hall at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in September 2011 when a neighbouring student asked him the time. \"My classmate is visually impaired, and had been for 10 years,\" explains Kim.  The student had a watch that could tell the time, but only by pressing a button that would make it speak out loud. Doing so in a classroom could be disruptive, so instead, says Kim, \"I was his wristwatch.\" There are a number of timepieces for the blind, including the   that uses a series of rumbles to denote hours and minutes. Tactile, or Braille watches, are popular in the blind and partially sighted community. They look similar to a normal watch, but the front glass can be flipped up, allowing the wearer to touch the hands and tell the time.  \"If you're blind you don't know if you've got up in the middle of the night,\" explains Leslie Duroe of RNIB, the UK's main charity for the blind and partially sighted. \"It can make people feel very insecure to not know what time it is.\" For Kim, previous designs were more functional than beautiful. Sighted people choose their watches as much as a fashion statement as for merely telling the time. Many might assume that blind people care only about function. But that's wrong. There were also practical criticisms over existing watches for some users - in the case of tactile or Braille watches, foreign objects such as food could clog or affect the progress of the hands.  Kim wanted a watch that looked good and would work for his friend.  \"I put together a team of engineers and we came up with the idea of a Braille display, one that would display the time written out in Braille,\" says Kim. But when a prototype was created, the feedback wasn't great. \"We learned that less than 10% of visually impaired people can read Braille,\" Kim says. What's more, many people in the UK and US are not born blind but develop sight problems later in their lives - 82% of those living with blindness are aged 50 or older, according to the World Health Organization. With less experience of reading Braille, their sense of touch is often less developed. Kim and his team went back to the drawing board - the timepiece went through 25 different versions, each one tested by visually impaired people.  There was always a battle between functionality and producing a beautiful object.  Damon Rose is blind, and produces the BBC's   - he describes the pros and cons of timepieces currently on sale for blind and partially-sighted people: \"Telling the time if you're blind is a question of 'tactile v talking'. A discreet feel of your Braille watch under the desk, allows you to know if a meeting is going on too long or if it's lunchtime. Unfortunately, touching the button on a talking watch, broadcasts the time to the whole room and rudely suggests, 'I want to be somewhere else.' And in the middle of the night can wake your partner unless you stifle it with a pillow.  \"Braille watches present other problems - you have to probe gently for fear of knocking the hands and altering the time. And if you want to check your watch during dinner, beware of getting food inside it. \"Manufacturers of accessible goods for blind people have discovered that producing something functional isn't enough - blind people always ask what it looks like, even though they can't see. In some ways, this suggests that it matters more if you're trying to control what people might think of you.\" Eventually, a design was agreed upon - a magnet underneath the metal watch face would control two rotating ball bearings for hours and minutes. But even the ball bearings were a matter of debate. \"People wanted the ball bearings to be bigger so they could feel it better,\" Kim says. \"But as designers, were concerned that making them bigger would make the watch clunky. We had to find the midpoint.\" In September 2011, the same month Hyungsoo Kim started work on his project, life changed for bomb disposal officer Lieutenant Bradley Snyder. He stood on an explosive device in Afghanistan, suffering serious injuries and losing his sight.  By August 2012, he had won two swimming gold medals at the London Paralympic games. But the practicalities of daily life were initially an immense struggle.  \"I was hurt in Afghanistan and the next thing I know I'm waking up in hospital in the United States. There was a 60 hour-long gap in my memory.\" Immediately Snyder, his sight lost, found getting his bearings difficult. \"You don't realise how much you use time to orient where you are. At the beginning it was very disorienting. And especially being in the military, time is all important.\" Eventually Snyder was approached by Kim, after a chance meeting with a mutual friend. \"Hyungsoo was making a product for blind people,\" says Snyder. \"I was his blind guy.\" \"I had a speaking watch for a little while,\" he begins. \"You pressed a button and it told you the time.\" Uncannily mimicking a robotic voice, Snyder says \"the time is 3:30pm\" and laughs. \"It was utilitarian. And if I'm on a train, I can't hear it. Fashionable brands have long dominated the sportswear market, but up to now few have specifically targeted disability sports. Nike has now become the first to produce a sole for a blade used by amputee runners. Has the era of Paralympic chic dawned? \"What's more, as soon as I hit that button it highlights me as someone with a special need. I love the idea of using the same thing that everyone does. And I want to feel as normal as possible.\" With the watch now named the Bradley, there was an appeal on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding website, in July last year - 3,681 people from 65 different countries backed the project, donating a total of $594,602 (\u00a3357,290). It will be available for sale from May in the US, with the UK and Europe likely to follow later. A further 1,000 people have since pre-ordered the watch online but only a tiny fraction of those - Kim estimates between 1-2% - are visually impaired.  \"It bridges the gap between the disabled and the non-disabled,\" says Snyder.  The watch is now among the favourites in the 76 nominations for the Designs of the Year contest at London's Design Museum. The nomination has already led to interest from European retailers. There's an obvious gimmick for selling to sighted people - you can check the time in a social or work setting without appearing rude. It's easy to imagine seeing the watch, with its titanium face and minimal style, on a wrist and not immediately guessing its genesis as an item for blind people.  \"The stereotype is that visually impaired people are not fashion-conscious,\" says Kim. \"I had that misconception too. But it's wrong.\" ",

Its court filing talks of wanting \"to protect the sanctity of the Starcraft II gaming experience\" and notes that its terms and conditions explicitly prohibit the use of \"hacks, mods or any other unauthorised third-party software\" designed to allow a player to boost their ranking and access new weapons and abilities. \"The competitive aspect of Starcraft II's multiplayer environment is one of the driving forces behind sales of the game,\" it states. \"In fact, the Starcraft game are played as a competitive sport around the world, with professional or semi-professional players competing for national and international titles. \"Additionally, the ability to play the game against skilled human opponents keeps the player experience fresh and interesting, thus ensuring that players return to the game frequently.\" The firm adds that it wishes the court to shut down the hacks and make their creators hand over the profits they had made. The case has echoes of Nintendo's court battles against the Games Genie - a cartridge that allowed players to enter codes to cheat at Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) titles in the early 1990s. Nintendo also alleged copyright infringement but lost the case after the judge ruled that consumers had the right to \"experiment with the product\" after paying a fair price for a game. Nintendo's rival Sega later gave its backing to the product and helped fund its marketing campaign. However, Blizzard has been more successful in this area following 1998's introduction of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which criminalised software designed to bypass digital locks.  In 2010 the firm won a copyright infringement  , which had sold a software \"bot\" that automatically played the early levels of World of Warcraft for players. \"The law in this area is relatively new as these forms of online games are only a decade old,\" Jas Purewal, editor of the Gamer Law news site told the BBC. \"Nonetheless, there have been a number of victories in this area and overall the odds are stacked against hackers and against cheaters once a games company is determined to take legal action.\" ",

The US agency's   anyone working for it who has used cannabis in the past three years. However, its director James Comey has acknowledged that this is complicating its efforts to recruit hacking experts, according to  . It said he made the announcement at a conference in New York.  \"I have to hire a great workforce to compete with those cybercriminals, and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview,\" the newspaper quoted him as saying at the White Collar Crime Institute's annual meeting. It added that when one attendee asked how a cannabis-using friend interested in working for the bureau should now act, Mr Comey replied: \"He should go ahead and apply.\" A spokeswoman for the FBI confirmed Mr Comey had discussed cannabis in unscripted remarks during a question and answer session after his speech at the conference. However, during a committee hearing at the Senate on Wednesday the FBI director subsequently said he had been trying to be \"philosophic and funny\" when he made the comments. \"I don't want young people to use marijuana. It's against the law,\" he added. \"I did not say that I'm going to change that ban. I said I have to grapple with the change in my workforce.\" Unlike the FBI, the UK's National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU)'s   make specific reference to cannabis, but does have a wider anti-drugs rule. \"Whilst previous drug taking is not necessarily a barrier to employment provided people are open about it, applicants are told not to apply if they have taken illegal drugs in the preceding 12 months,\" said a spokeswoman for the National Crime Agency, of which the NCCU is a division. \"Before joining all new entrants have to undertake a drugs screening test before appointment is confirmed.  \"Once employed, individuals are subject to NCA policies including random and intelligence-led 'with cause' substance testing. Certain high-risk posts require individuals to take more regular testing as a role requirement.\" One expert thought it was sensible to review such anti-drugs policies. \"The sort of hackers that you want to hire tend to be young, the young tend to have bad habits such as smoking marijuana, and over time you'd expect them to do this less,\" Dr Richard Clayton, from the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory, told the BBC. \"But equally, I believe the FBI and the National Cyber Crime Unit have more problem recruiting people because of the salaries they pay, which compare poorly with the salaries available in the private industry.\" The UK's Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told BBC Two's Newsnight programme in November that the NCCU might hire convicted hackers despite a current ban against recruits with a criminal record. \"The conviction would be examined in terms of how long ago it was, how serious it was, what sort of sentence had followed. So I can't rule it out,\" he said. But Dr Clayton said he was concerned how this might be implemented. \"We like to send out the message that hacking is very bad and that if you get caught it can ruin your life,\" he said. \"But it's a problem if you then say, 'If you get caught we might let you serve a few months in jail and then give you a nice cushy job.' \"Perhaps we might want to have some sort of 'we won't hire you until your conviction is at least five years old' sort of policy.\" ",

PetMatch runs image-recognition technology to match pictures of animals, selected by prospective owners, to an \"adoption database\".  the app can help owners find replacements for dead pets. The London rescue centre stressed that people should also research the animal's temperament before adopting. The centre's head of dog rehoming, Rob Young, told the BBC: \"We would not approve of using this as a method of choosing a new pet, largely because you should not be looking to rehome an animal on looks alone.\" The developers of the app pointed out that users were still able to carry out further checks before they took an animal home. Users either upload pictures of their ideal pet to the app or use a pre-loaded image. The app then uses image recognition technology to find matches among a database of animals that are up for adoption. Mr Young said that it would be possible to find identical matches but warned prospective pet owners to be careful. He said: \"There is a good chance they will behave very differently. They all have their own needs. We work to make sure that each animal gets sent to a home that suits their needs.\" Mr Young added: \"[Use of the app] points towards dogs and cats becoming disposable items. Getting a direct replacement is not the way we would want people to look at it.\" The developers, California-based Superfish, said their algorithms allowed the app to analyse pictures with \"no human involvement\". The company, which has been backed by five different venture capital firms to the tune of $19.3m (\u00a311.4m), said PetMatch was a \"faster, more intuitive way to bring you closer to finding exactly what you're looking for\". You should not be looking to rehome and animal on looks alone\u201d It added that the app helped users get in contact with pet-adoption agencies, once they had found the pet they are looking for. But Mr Young said that, while he understood why some people would find the app useful, he would advise people using it to \"find a dog or cat that looks identical to their old one\" to proceed with caution. \"[Owners] become incredibly attached to their pets. I own two terriers and I would probably look to get another if one passed away,\" he said. Superfish's head of communications Alisa MacDonnell said that using the app was \"just the beginning of the conversation\" and said users needed to meet an animal before adopting it. She added: We just helping animals find homes, that's our main mission.\" ",

The US firm said a database had been hacked between late February and early March, and had contained encrypted passwords and other non-financial data. The company added that it had no evidence of there being unauthorised activity on its members' accounts. However, it said that changing the passwords was \"best practice and will help enhance security for eBay users\". The California-based company has 128 million active users and accounted for $212bn (\u00a3126bn) worth of commerce on its various marketplaces and other services in 2013. It said it would be contacting users to alert them of the issue via email, its website, adverts and social media.  A spokesman added that the firm's engineers were in the process of rolling out a feature that would oblige members to choose new passwords when they next logged in, which should be live in each of the countries eBay operated in by the end of the day.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Rory Cellan-Jones: EBay has advised customers to change passwords A   said that cyber-attackers accessed the information after obtaining \"a small number of employee log-in credentials\", allowing them to access its systems - something it only became aware of a fortnight ago. \"The database... included eBay customers' name, encrypted password, email address, physical address, phone number and date of birth,\" it said. \"However, the database did not contain financial information or other confidential personal information.  \"Extensive forensics subsequently identified the compromised eBay database, resulting in the company's announcement today.\" Although the firm also owns the PayPal money transfer service, it said that the division's data was  stored separately, encrypted and that there was no evidence that it had been accessed. It added that any members who used the same login details used on eBay for other sites should also update them. EBay has not provided any information about the kind of encryption it used. One expert said there was still a concern that the hackers might be able to make use of their haul. \"We all know that given enough time hackers can crack some encrypted password files,\" said Alan Woodward, an independent security consultant. \"The slightly worrying aspect of this is that the hackers have a nice neat list of personal information, which can be used to steal identities or even help them get around other systems though password reset scams.\" Security expert Alan Woodward offers this advice:  Media requires JavaScript to play.

The Information Commissioner's Office's   is its first official response to last week's \"right to be forgotten\" EU ruling. The ICO will be responsible for resolving complaints in cases where a search firm refuses to remove links. It noted such action was months away. \"This judgment was only made last week, and the companies will need some time to work out how they're going to handle this,\" wrote David Smith, the body's director of data protection. \"We won't be ruling on any complaints until the search providers have had a reasonable time to put their systems in place and start considering requests.\" The Court of Justice of the European Union set a legal precedent on 13 May when it   had the right to have links to web pages about him removed from Google's results because the passage of time had made them \"irrelevant\". The Spanish man had complained that Google's links to an auction notice of his repossessed home  infringed his privacy. The takedown demand only applied to search results and not the web page containing the notice itself.  But the court added that others had a similar right to have search results deleted \"unless there are particular reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life\" that would justify keeping the links online. The court noted that if search engines refused to comply, it would be up to local authorities - such as the ICO - to force their hand. Google said the ruling was \"disappointing\" and that it needed time to \"analyse the implications\". But Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, has attacked the judgement, calling it \"wide-sweeping internet censorship\", adding that it would be difficult for search firms to determine what should be removed, The ICO acknowledged the \"right to be forgotten\" would be difficult to implement. \"It is important to keep the implications in proportion and recognise that there is no absolute right to have links removed,\" wrote Mr Smith. \"Our concern remains how this can be achieved in practice and how to set reasonable expectations for the public about how such a right can operate.\" He added that the ICO and other data protection authorities would need to issue guidance, and said that the organisation planned to discuss the matter with its European counterparts at the start of next month.

The TV and movie streaming service intends to launch in Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg. The US-based firm has 48 million subscribers in over 40 countries. One analyst said the success of the latest rollout might depend on how much content was dubbed into local languages. \"Germany potentially could be quite a difficult market as it has low pay-TV penetration and seemingly low willingness to pay,\" said Ian Maude from the media consultancy Enders Analysis. \"One thing I'm curious to see in Germany is whether or not it has dubbed a lot of the show for the market because - while French TV has a lot of subtitling - in Germany foreign language movies and TV shows are generally voiced over, and that can be quite an expensive process.\" Germany's large number of broadband users - the fourth biggest such population in the world - makes it a potentially lucrative market.  However, Netflix will have to compete against video-on-demand incumbents including Sky Deutschland's Snap, Vivendi's Watchever, ProSiebenSat.1's MaxDome and Amazon Instant Video. In France, it faces the prospect of competing against a rival that owns the rights to a series branded a \"Netflix exclusive\" in other territories: Vivendi's CanalPlay owns the domestic rights to the second season of the drama House of Cards in the country. Netflix also must contend with the fact that French audiovisual laws require local broadcasters to invest significant sums in domestic content. However, Les Echos   Netflix might get around this by basing the service in Luxembourg. For now, the firm has only said it would provide \"further details, including pricing, programming and supported devices at a later date\". California-based Netflix reported profits of $53m (\u00a332m) in its most recent quarter. We're going to learn as we go\u201d Despite previous international launches - including the Netherlands last year and the UK in 2012 - the firm's revenue is mostly generated by US subscribers. Netflix's most recent   it had 11.8 million members paying for streaming content outside the US at the end of March but about three times that figure within the country. The firm has previously said that it became profitable in Canada within two years of launch, but has not released similar information about its other foreign ventures. However, chief executive Reed Hastings recently said the company recognised that it must tailor the content it provided to each audience. \"We've seen tremendous success in the Netherlands, where we launched six months ago, and that, I think, encourages us about being able to figure out the right programming formula in each nation,\" he  . \"We're going to learn as we go. If we're very fortunate, we'll have programmed it completely correctly from day one.  \"More likely, we'll figure out some stuff's working, some stuff's not; we'll adjust the formula.\"\n ",

The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says that it is an embarrassing blunder that has so far cost the rail operator over 50m euros ($68.4m; \u00a340.6m). Our correspondent says that the cost is likely to rise even further.  Construction work has already started to reconfigure station platforms. The work will allow new trains room to pass through. But officials say that there are still 1,000 platforms to be adjusted. The error seems to have happened because the national rail operator RFF gave the wrong dimensions to train company SNCF.  Our correspondent says that they measured platforms built less than 30 years ago, overlooking the fact that many of France's regional platforms were built more than 50 years ago when trains were a little slimmer.  The platform edges are too close to the tracks in some stations which means the trains cannot get in, officials say. A spokesman for the RFF confirmed they had \"discovered the problem a bit late\". Transport Minister Frederic Cuvillier blamed an \"absurd rail system\" for the problems.  \"When you separate the rail operator from the train company,\" he said, \"this is what happens.\"  ",

        "article": "A Canadian firm has courted controversy with its claim to have built a practical quantum computer, a feat thought to be decades away. Now, independent researchers are trying to understand whether it really can tap the strange world of quantum physics. For the modest sum of $15m (\u00a39m), a start-up near Vancouver will sell you a black box the size of a garden shed with its logo emblazoned on the side in white neon.  Not sold yet? What if I told you the contents of the box were around 150 times colder than interstellar space?  You still need some convincing - I get it. How about this: The box contains a machine that can solve some of the thorniest mathematical problems and could revolutionise computing. Much of [the scepticism] has gone away as we've continued to advance our technology so far beyond what anyone else has done\u201d Well, the company's sales pitch has worked on some big names - like  ,  , and defence giant  . The Canadian start-up in question is called   and their monolithic machine is - they claim - nothing less than a real, working quantum computer. But not everyone is convinced. Quantum computing exploits the weird physics that takes hold at tiny (atomic or sub-atomic) scales. Computers that tap the quantum realm could carry out complex calculations much faster than their conventional - or classical - counterparts. While the basic units of information in classical computers are called \"bits\" and are stored as a string of 1s and 0s, their equivalents in a quantum system - qubits - can be both 1s and 0s at the same time.  This phenomenon would enable multiple calculations to be performed simultaneously. But the qubits need to be synchronised using a quantum effect known as entanglement, which Albert Einstein termed \"spooky action at a distance\". Scientists have struggled to entangle more than a handful of qubits, and to maintain them in their quantum state. Lab devices suffer from drop-out, where the qubits lose their ambiguity and become straightforward 1s and 0s. This has ensured that quantum computers remain confined to the lab - proofs of principle capable of solving only elementary problems. Headquartered in the small tech hub of Burnaby, on Canada's west coast, D-Wave has raised upwards of $100m in venture capital from the likes of Amazon founder   and  , the venture capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  \"The original vision of the company was simple: build a commercially useful quantum computer as soon as possible,\" Vern Brownell, D-Wave's chief executive, tells me. \"We just want to provide quantum computing resources to researchers and businesses around the world so they can solve really hard problems, better than they can today.\" So far there's no speedup to explain\u201d So when, in 2007, D-Wave   of a quantum processor called Orion that could solve Sudoku puzzles and search a public database of drugs to find the closest match to a specific molecule - both impressive achievements in this field - it was greeted with deep scepticism. Four years later, the company unveiled the \"first commercially available quantum computer\", a 128-qubit machine called the D-Wave One, and this time its claims weren't so easily dismissed. The announcement coincided with the publication of a study   in Nature, one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed journals in the world.  This tempered some of the criticism, but fell short of winning over vocal sceptics like Scott Aaronson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He thinks the firm's computers show \"pretty good\" evidence for entanglement at a local level, though not necessarily on a large scale. But he sees no evidence that this is helping boost the performance of D-Wave's machines. Prof Aaronson told BBC News: \"The questions about 'the explanation for the speedup' haven't even been activated yet, since so far there's no speedup to explain!\" Mr Brownell comments: \"What I think is really interesting is that scientists and researchers are no longer arguing about whether it works, it's how fast does it work? What's the scalability going to be?\" There are things we take for granted about the world around us. Let go of your smartphone and it will fall to the ground. Pull the handle on a drawer and it will open. These familiar rules can be described by the principles of classical mechanics.  But in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, scientists were beginning to realise that classical physics could not explain certain phenomena seen at very large and very small scales.  This spawned two revolutions: one was relativity and the other quantum mechanics. Early experiments suggested light was a wave, rather than a stream of particles. In quantum theory, light can be both a particle (the photon) and a wave.  One principle central to quantum mechanics is that a particle, such as an electron, can exist in all of its possible states simultaneously - known as superposition. Another important idea is that of entanglement, a phenomenon whereby objects become linked, even if they lie far apart. The company's first commercial machine was followed in 2013 by the D-Wave Two, powered by a 512-qubit chip called Vesuvius. Like its predecessor, this computer is not for conventional use, but was designed for solving optimisation problems, a particular class of mathematical challenge that entails finding the best solution from all the possible solutions. Lockheed is using its D-Wave computer - housed at the University of Southern California - to  . Google's machine, which is shared with Nasa  , is being used for machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence with applications in areas as diverse as voice recognition and detecting credit card fraud. The big name buy-in has generated serious buzz, but sceptics have not been swayed. \"I don't care if the Messiah has come to Earth on a flaming chariot, not to usher in an age of peace but simply to spend $10m on D-Wave's new Vesuvius chip,\" Scott Aaronson  , adding that the considered opinion of an academic expert of his choice \"would mean more to me than 500,000 business deals\". D-Wave was founded in 1999 as a University of British Columbia spin-out by Rose - who holds a PhD in physics and a light-heavyweight world title in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - and his academic mentor Haig Farris.  \"The team spent about five years, with collaborators in various kinds of academic environments, coming to a view on the fastest way to come to market with something useful,\" says Mr Brownell.  The so-called gate model underpins the vast majority of academic research into quantum computing. This idea is based on developing the quantum equivalents of the logic gates that form the building blocks of circuits in classical computing. But D-Wave settled on an approach called quantum annealing. Outlined in   by Eddie Farhi of MIT, and others, this technique is fundamentally different to the theory of quantum gates. In Rose's chosen martial art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, opponents start off on their feet and typically end up grappling on the mat. The aim in quantum annealing is also to reach the \"ground state\" - in this case, the lowest energy point. One common analogy is that of a cross-section through a mountain range. The altitude of the landscape describes the energy, or cost, of the solution. The aim is to find the lowest point on the map and read the coordinates, as this gives the lowest energy, or \"best\", solution to the problem. \"The way you would do it in classical computing is to walk up and down the valleys and hills until you've found it,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a computing expert from the University of Surrey. \"What the quantum annealing process does for you is effectively to tunnel through the mountain... until it announces: 'The lowest point I found was X'.\" \"It shortcuts everything, and that's how it speeds up.\" Experts say quantum annealing can't offer the performance boost theoretically possible with gates, but proponents of D-Wave's approach point to innate advantages, such as greater robustness to the \"drop-out\" problem that plagues gate model quantum computing. Dr Rose has even branded quantum gates the \"single worst thing that ever happened to quantum computing\". Whatever the route taken, efforts to build a quantum computer must overcome daunting engineering hurdles. The circuits in D-Wave's processors are superconducting, which means they have zero electrical resistance and generate no heat. In order to get quantum effects, liquid helium is used to cool the chip to 0.02 Kelvin, a shade above the temperature known as absolute zero. The whole system is enclosed in a so-called Faraday Cage, which blocks external electrical fields that could interfere with quantum mechanical behaviour. I'm gently pleased by their boldness, to have a go and make the thing\u201d Prof Andrew Steane, from the department of physics at Oxford University, says: \"If you go back five or 10 years, the initial statements coming out of D-Wave - before they had a device to look at - were seen as something you could ignore, because it just didn't seem credible. \"Then they produced this device, so they came up with the goods. And it's a non-negligible device - it has serious computing power. It's just a question of whether what it's achieving is beyond what could have been done with a system based on classical physics.\" Significant academic effort is now being thrown at this question. Last year saw the publication of several scientific studies favourable to the company's case, including indirect evidence for entanglement of qubits and research by Catherine McGeoch, a professor of computer science at Amherst College, that found the system   than did a standard desktop machine. But in January 2014, a team led by Matthias Troyer, of ETH Zurich in Switzerland, published   of Lockheed's unit. Team members won't comment publicly until the work is published in a peer-reviewed journal, but in some tests devised by them, the D-Wave machine was found to perform no faster than a classical computer. However, company executives counter that the tests used were not the sort where the quantum computer offers any advantage over conventional types. Then in February, a team led by Prof Umesh Vazirani, of the University of California, Berkeley,   concluding that a simple, classical computing model of interacting magnets could explain behaviour in D-Wave's machines. In his response to an unfavourable   about the paper penned by Dr Rose, Prof Vazirani suggested that key questions might be answered if D-Wave were to grant researchers  , which is proprietary. However, not everyone thinks this would shed much light on the matter. What Geordie (Rose) said was - let's build what we can do, instead of always thinking about things that are out of reach\u201d \"At a high level, we know what the machine is doing: namely, it's doing annealing to the ground state, with superconducting Josephson junctions (paired superconductors) at 20mK (milliKelvin) temperature, in a way that's 'mostly classical' but that has some quantum effects present, at least at the local level,\" says Prof Aaronson. \"I think this research has actually reached some pretty firm conclusions: most importantly, that the current device is   getting a speedup on the problem distributions currently being tried,\" he explains. Andrew Steane says the computers show promise, but on the question of whether they are exploiting quantum effects for performance gains he says the studies by Troyer and Vazirani \"suggest they can't yet really make that claim\". But the company points to ongoing   and cites   from recent months that support their case.  Mr Brownell comments: \"How many trillions have been invested in classical computing? How many innovations and iterations of hardware since John Von Neumann and the Bletchley Park folks? \"How much algorithm work and research around software and applications and compilers and efficiency? We've come up with something in 10 years that performs just as well, and maybe outperforms in some narrow cases that entire ecosystem.\" Geordie Rose told BBC News: \"Scepticism implies a healthy and unbiased doubt about new technological capabilities or scientific advancements. Much of that has gone away as we've continued to advance our technology so far beyond what anyone else has done.\"   \"The negativity against pioneering companies though comes from small but vocal groups concerned about losing access to funding, and from commercial competitors. I believe the former will go away once these folks realise that our success means more money for their basic science, not less.\" D-Wave's next chip, consisting of 1,024-qubits, is currently undergoing calibration ahead of its planned release later this year. In addition to its aforementioned customers, D-Wave has others it won't name. The firm is now looking to expand into other potentially lucrative markets. \"As we get some more internal resources to support customers adequately, we would like to branch out into other areas like bioinformatics, energy exploration, finance,\" says Vern Brownell. \"We know already there are huge applications in each of these areas for quantum computing.\" Documents leaked by Edward Snowden reveal that the US National Security Agency (NSA)   to determine whether it was possible to build a quantum computer that would be useful for cracking encrypted communications.  But D-Wave's quantum annealing approach isn't well suited to this application. Cryptanalysis is an area where researchers seem to agree that the logic gate model offers more promise. Of the company's efforts, Alan Woodward says: \"The engineering difficulties [of building quantum computers] are enormous, because of susceptibilities to interactions from the environment and so on. What Geordie said was - let's build what we can, instead of always thinking about things that are out of reach. And you've got to admire that. \"I suspect it's something that's helping to move on the state-of-the-art from an engineering perspective, even if it turns out not to be the ultimate shape of things to come.\" Andrew Steane comments: \"I'm gently pleased by their boldness, to have a go and make the thing. \"It's a bit like 'Make it and they will come'. They haven't quite got to 'they will come'. But they've made something.\" Follow Paul  . ",

        "article": "Google is rumoured to be in talks over a $1bn (\u00a3593m) deal for the video game-streaming service Twitch. The fast-growing service allows gamers to broadcast their play live so that others can watch.  that Google-owned YouTube has beaten off competition from Microsoft to reach an agreement. Google is refusing to comment, but   say talks are continuing and at an early stage. Gamers use Twitch to broadcast their gameplay for other users to watch and provide tutorials. It works on desktop, but perhaps one of the company's main strengths is that it is built into the two major consoles on the market: Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's XBox One. Indeed,   that Twitch's desire to remain neutral in that respect was behind its reluctance to sign a deal with Microsoft. Users can also play games live. A video that allowed users to play Pokemon by entering commands into the comments also proved incredibly popular, with more than 60 million views to date.  Services like YouTube have long been used by players to post footage of themselves playing games, with football games particularly popular. The big difference with Twitch is that it is more akin to live television. In a word, yes. And Twitch is the biggest site for it.  , it was bigger in the United States than some of the mainstream sports broadcasters. In February this year, Twitch reported 45 million unique monthly viewers in 2013, more than doubling its 2012 figure. And it said that six million videos were broadcast per month last year, twice the figure in 2012. According to a survey by broadband service provider Sandvine released earlier this month, Twitch accounted for 1.35% of all internet traffic during peak hours in the USA. A report from CBS Interactive in 2012 claimed that the eSports scene - organised tournaments between gamers, some of whom are professionals - was mainly attracting men aged 18 to 34 and Twitch has said it broadly followed that trend. In an interview the same year, two Twitch executives said they were also trying to bring in more female viewers and contributors. Some broadcasters have huge audiences, but Twitch says it also has many who cater for much smaller ones. Around the turn of the year, Twitch was   and take disciplinary action after a member of its staff banned some users from the site over what it admitted were \"innocuous remarks\" about him during a row over copyrighted images. The company said that the staff member, who was using the online moniker \"Horror\", should have recused himself. It also took action against a volunteer site administrator who censored online posts critical of Twitch during the same argument. \"We at Twitch do not believe in censoring discussion, and more to the point know that it's doomed to failure,\" said a statement. Perhaps predictably, Twitch is based in San Francisco. It separated from online video broadcaster Justin.tv in 2011 and, in September last year, announced its largest round of new funding to date with $20m invested by three parties, including the publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series. It said at the time that it hoped the money would help it \"grow and tap into new markets\". But, only three months later,   - problems YouTube could be in a position to solve. In total, the company has raised $35m (\u00a320.8m) in funding from six investors, so a $1bn deal with YouTube would represent quite a return. And one of the investors in the latest round WestSummit Capital said it expected Twitch to focus on growth in the Asia Pacific region. Advertising is central to Twitch's business. It has its own banner adverts on its site but also allows users to place additional ads within their videos. Video creators can run ads before or during their broadcasts and receive a share of the revenue generated once the total exceeds $100. Twitch also allows some members with large followings to become partners who can accept subscribers, normally at $5 per head. Subscribers get privileged access to more content on the selected users' channels and, again, Twitch takes a share of the money. In addition, the site allows members to donate to each other, potentially making it more attractive to create content, although Twitch does not take a cut of such payments.   while claiming to be wheelchair-bound met with trouble when he stood up before his broadcast cut out. In February this year, the site launched a Turbo subscription service costing $8.99. It spares subscribers the obligation of sitting through adverts and provides additional benefits. ",

        "article": "It's 0700 and I'm proud to tell you that after an early run, I've taken 5,445 steps, or actually 4,997 steps or maybe 4,545 steps - or perhaps I've acquired 1,543 fuel points, whatever they are.  All of this data comes from a couple of fitness bands and a smartphone app I've been trying out for a radio piece about this strange fad for measuring our daily activities. (You can hear it on The World At One on Wednesday).  For the last year or so the hot new trend has been wearable technology - all sorts of gadgets laden with sensors that will deliver us information or measure our lives in meaningful ways. The first real manifestation of this has come in the form of various fitness devices - mostly glorified pedometers that tell you how far you've moved.  But even before this idea has really hit the mainstream, doubts have set in. It has emerged that Nike has   and will henceforth concentrate on software. That may be because it is working with Apple on a fitness product, but there are still questions over just how big a market this is. And some early adopters are already showing signs of fitness fatigue. Stuart Miles of the gadget blog Pocket-Lint was the man who sparked my interest in these devices last year. When we met up recently, he reminded me that I had once rung him late at night to say that I'd just managed to hit my Nike Fuelband target by doing star jumps in the living room.  There's a gap between the data that you collect - and the need to do something about it\u201d But then he reveals that he's stopped wearing his Fuelband: \"At first it's exciting. But after a while you fall into a pattern so you know what you're doing , you don't need something to tell you how you're doing that day - so after a while you take them off.\" And Olivia Solon of wired.co.uk tells me that she'd been an enthusiastic Fitbit user for six months and like me, had found herself exercising somewhat manically late at night to hit her target. \"But after about six months I got a data blindness, and stopped looking at the figures and as a result wasn't doing any more exercise. There's a gap between the data that you collect - and the need to do something about it.\" We are however at the very early stages of wearable fitness monitors. Solon thinks the killer app could be a device that measures calorie intake (\"that will be truly transformative\") and the fitness firms have plans to collect far more data.  Privacy groups are beginning to take an interest in the sheer quantity of data that we are handing over when we sync our Nike Fuelbands or our Jawbone Ups to the cloud\u201d I puff up the stairs in my office with Jawbone's Jorgen Nordin, recording more steps on the Up band, which is his firm's fastest selling product. He explains what the future holds: \"It's all about more sensors, we'll have them in our bodies, there'll be more sensors built into shoes and shirts or maybe earrings. There'll be multiple sensors that measure multiple data points - and all of these data points will allow us to provide even more valuable feedback to the end user.\" Ah, but that is the question - who will really want all that data, and who will benefit from it? Privacy groups are beginning to take an interest in the sheer quantity of data that we are handing over when we sync our Nike Fuelbands or our Jawbone Ups to the cloud. Already some employers are introducing fitness bands - on a voluntary basis of course - to measure their employees' well-being. And at least one health insurance firm is offering lower premiums to customers who track their activities with one of these gadgets. But we are all going to have to be far more interested in our own data - and convinced that tracking it can improve our lives - if these devices and apps are going to reach byond the niche of the \"quantified self\" movement. Oh, by the way - I ended my day having taken 13,329 steps according to my Nike Fuelband, 14,309 if you believe the Breeze smartphone app, and 13,691 according to the Jawbone Up. Then, according to the Up, I slept for six hours and 24 minutes, with three hours, 32 minutes of sound sleep and two hours, 51 minutes of light sleep. It seems to me that what I need to do now is move less and sleep more - perhaps these gadgets can help after all. ",

        "article": "As our identities become more entrenched on the web, a slew of apps want us to return to an earlier era of anonymity on the internet. But can apps such as Secret - which has just launched on Android - really keep our identities, well, secret? Think back to an AOL chatroom. Wait for the modem to sing its song, click the connect button, find a room - and inevitably, the first question you're asked as soon as you log in is \"a/s/l?\" - age/sex/location.  In other words: \"Who are you?\" For many people, this was the defining feature of the internet: anonymity. A place where screen names and loose identification protocols made the web, by default, an opaque place. Today, our digital identities adhere ever more closely to our real lives, with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allowing real-time and often permanent imprints of our existence. While alleviating one concern - identification - they have created another: is there any way to be open on the internet anymore, without fear of reprisal? I think we're really well positioned to own anonymity\u201d That is why a whole host of firms are arguing that it is time to return to, or at least make space for, anonymity. \"You look at all of these services like Facebook and Instagram, and they're all about let me show you the best version of me,\" argues Whisper co-founder Michael Heyward. \"It's essentially this highlight reel - Whisper is about showing people the behind the scenes stuff that we're not always comfortable posting on Facebook.\" Whisper allows users to download an app and then post anonymous statements - everything from \"do you like this outfit?\" to \"I'm worried I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder\". Users can then like statements they identify with or think are funny. Mr Heyward likens it to the Catholic concept of a confession - but a confession that also operates as a business. Whisper has raised over $60m (\u00a336m) since being founded two years ago. \"I think we're really well positioned to own anonymity,\" he says. But Mr Heyward isn't the only one to realise that both the intrusion of social networks into our \"real lives\" and the Edward Snowden US government spying revelations have led to an increased desire for anonymity on the web.  And, of course, capitalising on that desire for anonymity could be big business. Whisper's Michael Heyward was recently taken to task by Michael Arringon, co-founder of the TechCrunch website, for claiming that Whisper helped make the world more open. Mr Arrington cited a Whisper where an anonymous user claimed Gwyneth Paltrow was having an affair. \"How does outing Gwyneth Paltrow cheating on her husband make this a more caring world?\" asked Mr Arrington. While that question went unanswered, it raised another question: could Whisper be sued for libel? Not in the US, says law professor James Grimmelman. \"US law - section 230 - provides that no provider of a user generated content site is responsible for user generated content,\" he says. \"It lets everything from Reddit to Facebook not be treated as having published anything defamatory or harassing.\" Secret, founded in October and launched in January by two former Google employees, Chrys Bader-Wechseler and David Byttow, has already raised $11.5m. Unlike Whisper, it accesses your phone's contacts and only shows you Secrets from friends or friends of friends. It was a hit with iPhone users in Silicon Valley, where they posted juicy titbits, including news of which tech start-ups had been bought for millions and, most notably,  . And the app has just been made available in all countries both on iOS and Android. Mr Bader-Wecheseler says that the duo didn't design the app with the concept of whistle-blowing in mind. But now \"we constantly ask ourselves is whistle-blowing important, and we think so\". But thinking whistle-blowing is important and promising anonymity are two very different things. \"The problem with apps on mobile phones is that, well, it's a mobile phone,\" says Runi Sandvik, a technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"It's tied to you in some way or another and this identifier is often passed to the makers of these applications. So even if these apps on their website are promising you anonymity, if asked or required they will hand over your information to law enforcement.\" Ms Sandvik says that promises of anonymity are thus essentially a \"marketing gimmick\" because \"you don't want to advertise an app that promises semi-anonymity\". And it is not just users who could find themselves in hot water. University of Maryland law professor James Grimmelman notes that Snapchat, the self-deleting photo messaging app,   with US authorities over promises that images could not be stored. \"If users can be identified you cannot promise anonymity,\" he says. He adds that the Nike leak also could cause legal issues, including leaking trade secrets and raising questions about insider trading.  That's why perhaps \"it's more about pseudo-nymity - the ability to have a real identity but being able to turn it off when you want to,\" says Dil-Domine Leonares, founder of an app called Breakr, which allows users anonymously join chatrooms based on their location. That is a sentiment echoed, in some part, by Secret's founders, who insist the app isn't all about whistle-blowing. \"Facebook trained us to curate our identity - I think Secret can train us in empathy,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler. But that assumes - or presumes - that what people have to share is not mean, or slanderous, or just simply banal. One recent Secret read: \"Just spent 45 min trying to teach my cat a trick. He didn't get it. We'll work on it tomorrow.\" Not exactly the stuff that moves mountains. But then again, scroll down a bit and I found \"Twitch.tv is rumored to have been acquired for $1b. Any big paydays for non-execs?\" - something a bit more up my alley as a technology journalist. Scroll down once more, this time on Whisper, and I found out that the ex-wife of a prominent technology executive was now dating. And therein lies the question: are these apps about sharing feelings that can't be expressed publicly, leaking corporate secrets, or, simply trading in something that pre-dates the iPhone: gossip? There's also the less philosophical, more practical issue, the word that is almost never spoken in the bubbly world of Silicon Valley: profits. \"We think about it every now and then but we haven't invested resources in solving this problem,\" says Mr Bader-Wechseler.
