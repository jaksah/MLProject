In the  , 209 out of the 415 who were initially told their cancer was slow-growing were found to have a more aggressive form of the disease.  And for almost a third of the 415 men, it had spread beyond the prostate.  Scientists are calling for better tests to define the nature of the cancer. This is a very good and thoughtful study and I think it does inform what we should be doing in the NHS\u201d Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK. There are 41,700 new cases diagnosed and 10,800 deaths each year. The prostate is a gland located between the bladder and the penis, just in front of the rectum.  For this study, scientists at the University of Cambridge graded the men's cancer before and after they had surgery, between 2007 and 2011.  Study author Greg Shaw, a urological surgeon at the University of Cambridge, said there were a \"surprising\" number of men who were not diagnosed appropriately the first time around.  He said the study was \"very important\" for British men as cohorts abroad were not always comparable to the type of prostate cancer in the UK.  At the moment, men with low-grade, early stage cancers are offered the choice of an operation, to remove the prostate, or active surveillance, where doctors perform regular blood tests and examinations.  Mr Shaw said if men opted for active surveillance, 30% of them would be likely to need \"radical treatment\", such as surgery and radiotherapy, five years later.  \"This shows there is room for improvement,\" he said.  But he said there was potential for bias in the study, as there might have been a subtlety in the advice given to men in the clinic that hinted their cancer was more severe, which could have been why they opted for surgery. Accurate prostate cancer diagnosis continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing the disease today\u201d So the study was not necessarily representative of those men who opted for active surveillance, he said. Mr Shaw said a template biopsy, which looks at more tissue samples than the usual prostate biopsy, should be included.  Biopsies examine tissue removed from the body to see the extent of the disease. More samples may give a clearer picture of the extent of the disease.  He also said MRI scans should be improved to identify how aggressive the prostate cancer was from the outset.   Prof David Dearnaley, at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"I think this is a very good and thoughtful study and I think it does inform what we should be doing in the NHS.\"  But he said the study had limitations as the definitions of \"significant\" cancer were uncertain.  Prof Dearnaley said targeted biopsies would be better than the random ones which are currently used.  Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK said: \"Accurate prostate cancer diagnosis continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing the disease today.  \"The results of this study highlight yet again that existing tests cannot provide a precise picture of the aggressiveness of a man's cancer, often leaving men and their doctors to make difficult decisions about treatment without all the facts.\" He said until tests improved, it was important men talked to their doctors about the pros and cons of each treatment.

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Professor Carl Heneghan said side effects included serious \"psychiatric adverse events, renal adverse events and metabolic adverse events\" Hundreds of millions of pounds may have been wasted on a drug for flu that works no better than paracetamol, a landmark analysis has said.  The UK has spent \u00a3473m on Tamiflu, which is stockpiled by governments globally to prepare for flu pandemics.   claimed the drug did not prevent the spread of flu or reduce dangerous complications, and only slightly helped symptoms. The manufacturers Roche and other experts say the analysis is flawed.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Barry Clinch from Roche said Tamiflu had been approved by 100 regulators around the world The antiviral drug Tamiflu was stockpiled from 2006 in the UK when some agencies were predicting that a pandemic of bird flu could kill up to 750,000 people in Britain. Similar decisions were made in other countries.  The drug was widely prescribed during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Drug companies do not publish all their research data. This report is the result of a colossal fight for the previously hidden data into the effectiveness and side-effects of Tamiflu.  It concluded that the drug reduced the persistence of flu symptoms from seven days to 6.3 days in adults and to 5.8 days in children. But the report's authors said drugs such as paracetamol could have a similar impact.  On claims that the drug prevented complications such as pneumonia developing, Cochrane suggested the trials were so poor there was \"no visible effect\". Another justification for stockpiling was to slow the spread of the disease to give time for a vaccine to be developed. The report's authors said \"the case for this is simply unproven\" and \"there is no credible way these drugs could prevent a pandemic\". It also claimed that the drug had a number of side-effects, including nausea, headaches, psychiatric events, kidney problems and hyperglycaemia.  Carl Heneghan, Professor of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford and one of the report's authors, told the BBC: \"I think the whole \u00a3500m has not benefited human health in any way and we may have harmed people.  \"Does a drug work?\" should be an easy question to answer. Yet after hundreds of millions of pounds, either down the drain or saving lives depending on your stance, this question is being asked of Tamiflu. It stems from the way drugs are approved. Pharmaceutical companies conduct trials, some but not all of the data is made publicly available and regulators decide if it works. It is estimated that, entirely legally, half of clinical trials have never been reported and that favourable data is more likely to published. The UK Public Accounts Committee said the lack of data available to researchers and doctors was \"of extreme concern\". So the Tamiflu saga raises another important question - what other drugs are we using that might not work as well as we thought? \"The system that exists for producing evidence on drugs is so flawed and open to misuse that the public has been misled.\"  Dr Tom Jefferson, a clinical epidemiologist and former GP, said: \"I wouldn't give it for symptom relief, I'd give paracetamol.\" The Cochrane Collaboration researchers have not placed the blame on any individual or organisation, instead saying there had been failings at every step from the manufacturers to the regulators and government.  However, there is disagreement about the findings and accusations that a simultaneous campaign to open up drug research is influencing the findings.  The pharmaceutical company Roche said \"we disagree with the overall conclusions\" and warned they could \"potentially have serious public health implications\". Its UK medical director, Dr Daniel Thurley, told the BBC News website: \"The definitive piece of research stands as the randomised control trials, which were shared with the regulators, which led to them in 100 countries around the world approving Tamiflu for treatment and prevention of flu.\" He said the Cochrane group had used the wrong statistics, which \"systematically underestimate the benefits\" of the drug, and used \"unorthodox\" methods to analyse the side-effects.  Media requires JavaScript to play. He concluded: \"One of the challenges we have here is actually knowing what they've done.\" Prof Wendy Barclay, who researches the influenza virus at Imperial College London, said reducing symptoms in children by 29 hours would be \"pretty beneficial\". She told the BBC: \"Tamiflu works as well as any drug we have now or [that] is on the cards.  \"Yes, I think they should replenish the stockpile. What else can you do if a pandemic strikes? We won't have a vaccine for the first six months.\"  It is a potential limitation of this study that the work has been carried out alongside campaigning on access to trial data\u201d She also questioned the validity of the research as it analysed the impact during seasonal flu: \"If it works a little bit in season flu, the chances are they'll work quite a lot better in a pandemic situation and get more people back to school and work.\" Kevin McConway, a professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said it was an \"impressive\" piece of work. He said: \"It is a potential limitation of this study that the work has been carried out alongside campaigning on access to trial data.  \"The writers of the review have a clear position in this controversy, and, although I personally do generally agree with their position, I feel it does at times lead to some confusion between reporting the results of the review of these particular drugs and commenting on the general position on access to and use of unpublished data.\" The Department of Health, which took the lead for the UK, said Britain was recognised as \"one of the best prepared countries in the world for a potential flu pandemic\" and \"our stockpile of antivirals is a key part of this. \"We regularly review all published data and will consider the Cochrane review closely.\" The World Health Organization, which classes Tamiflu as an essential medicine, said: \"We welcome a new and rigorous analysis of available data, and look forward to consideration of its findings after it appears.\"  ",

        "article": "Spending lots of time on Facebook looking at pictures of friends could make women insecure about their body image, research suggests. The more women are exposed to \"selfies\" and other photos on social media, the more they compare themselves negatively, according to a study. Friends' photos may be more influential than celebrity shots as they are of known contacts, say UK and US experts. The study is the first to link time on social media to poor body image. The mass media are known to influence how people feel about their appearance. The attention to physical attributes may be even more dangerous on social media than on traditional media because participants in social media are people we know\u201d But little is known about how social media impact on self-image. Young women are particularly high users of social networking sites and post more photographs of themselves on the internet than do men. To look at the impact on body image, researchers at the University of Strathclyde, Ohio University and University of Iowa surveyed 881 female college students in the US. The women answered questions about their Facebook use, eating and exercise regimes, and body image.  The research, presented at a conference in Seattle, found no link with eating disorders. But it did find a link between time spent on social networks and negative comparisons about body image. The more time women spent on Facebook, the more they compared their bodies with those of their friends, and the more they felt negative about their appearance. \"Spending more time on Facebook is not connected to developing a bad relationship with food, but there is a connection to poor body image,\" Petya Eckler, of the University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow, told the BBC. She added: \"The attention to physical attributes may be even more dangerous on social media than on traditional media because participants in social media are people we know.  \"These comparisons are much more relevant and hit closer to home. Yet they may be just as unrealistic as the images we see on traditional media.\"  A spokesperson for the Beat eating disorders charity said body image was a key part of our sense of identity and not a trivial matter or personal vanity.  A preoccupation with weight and shape was one of the key features of current popular culture, and was a global phenomenon, she said.  \"The fascination with celebrities, their bodies, clothes and appearance has all increased the pressure that people typically feel at a time when they seek to establish their own identities and when their bodies are growing and changing,\" she said.  \"Young people compare themselves to the images that bombard them and feel it is their fault that their bodies compare so unfavourably.\" ",

        "article": "Four women have had new vaginas grown in the laboratory and implanted by doctors in the US. A tissue sample and a biodegradable scaffold were used to grow vaginas in the right size and shape for each woman as well as being a tissue match.   They all reported normal levels of \"desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction\" and painless intercourse.  Experts said the study, published in the Lancet, was the latest example of the power of regenerative medicine.  In each woman the vagina did not form properly while they were still inside their mother's womb, a condition known as vaginal aplasia.   Current treatments can involve surgically creating a cavity, which is then lined with skin grafts or parts of the intestine.  Doctors at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centre in North Carolina used pioneering technology to build vaginas for the four women who were all in their teenage years at the time.  Scans of the pelvic region were used to design a tube-like 3D-scaffold for each patient.  A small tissue biopsy was taken from the poorly developed vulva and grown to create a large batch of cells in the laboratory.  This is an exciting glimpse into the future of medicine. Using living tissue as building material to transform the lives of patients has already happened with bladders, blood vessels and windpipes. Now you can add vaginas and noses to the list.  There are even attempts to make more complex organs. Weakly beating hearts, and kidneys that can produce urine, have been made in animal studies. But this is still a long way from being used in humans.   Expect 3D printing to revolutionise this field as the technology to precisely place both the cells and the scaffolding improves. Muscle cells were attached to the outside of the scaffold and vaginal-lining cells to the inside.  The vaginas were carefully grown in a bioreactor until they were suitable to be surgically implanted into the patients.   One of the women with an implanted vagina, who wished to keep her name anonymous, said: \"I believe in the beginning when you find out you feel different. \"I mean while you are living the process, you are seeing the possibilities you have and all the changes you'll go through.  \"Truly I feel very fortunate because I have a normal life, completely normal.\"  All the women reported normal sexual function.  Vaginal aplasia can lead to other abnormalities in the reproductive organs, but in two of the women the vagina was  connected to the uterus.   There have been no pregnancies, but for those women it is theoretically possible. Dr Anthony Atala, director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest, told the BBC News website: \"Really for the first time we've created a whole organ that was never there to start with, it was a challenge.\"  He said a functioning vagina was a \"very important thing\" for these women's lives and witnessing the difference it made to them \"was very rewarding to see\".  This is the first time the results have been reported. However, the first implants took place eight years ago.  Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Basel in Switzerland have used similar techniques to reconstruct the noses of patients after skin cancer.  It could replace the need to take cartilage from the ribs or ears in order to rebuild the damage caused by cutting the cancer away. Prof Martin Birchall, who has worked on lab-grown windpipes, commented: \"These authors have not only successfully treated several patients with a difficult clinical problem, but addressed some of the most important questions facing translation of tissue engineering technologies.   The steps between first-in-human experiences such as those reported here and their use in routine clinical care remain many, including larger trials with long-term follow-up, the development of clinical grade processing, scale-out, and commercialisation.\" ",

        "article": "A new website is being launched to help adults spot the warning signs of mental health problems in children. In Scrubbing Up this week, child psychiatrist Dr Raphael Kelvin - who led the project - says if we're to really support children with mental health problems, we need to more aid - including in the classroom.  There are at least 850,000 children in the UK with a diagnosed mental health condition and the figure may well be rising.  Yet 75% do not receive the support they are entitled to and need.  We are, albeit unwittingly, condemning thousands of the country's most vulnerable children to years of distress and lost opportunities. Why? On the one hand, many mental health services for children and young people are underdeveloped and often underfunded.   But there's another key problem. Many healthcare professionals, teachers, police, volunteers and others who come into contact with them, do not know what a mental health condition looks like or how to approach the issue. So what needs to be done?  There are an estimated 9.5m children in the education system, making schools a vital place to start.   When we polled the public on the issue, 69% said they supported the notion that every school should have a dedicated member of staff on site for children to approach about mental health and well-being issues.   Nearly two-thirds (63%) also felt it was important that every school has regular interaction with a specialist from mental healthcare services.   And perhaps most striking is that 37% would turn to a teacher for help and advice if they suspected a child had a mental health issue.  So we need to be supporting schools to be able to identify, refer and support those children who show signs of mental ill health and make sure they get the appropriate help quickly.  Without investment in school mental health provision, we're missing a real opportunity to have an impact. Beyond the school gates, where else should these priorities lie?   This is complex topic and it includes further improvement and development of a range of important services.  All too often I see children and young people who enter the health system when they've been struggling with a mental health problem for a long time.  \u201d Getting it right online has to be a key focus as that's where many people turn for information first.  The same poll highlighted that over a third of adults would not know how to spot a child with a potential mental health issue.   Many weren't aware that poor appetite and weight loss could be a symptom of depression, over half weren't sure if waking earlier than usual could be a sign of mental health problems - and excessive boredom and poor concentration can be causes for concern.    And when people don't know, one of the first places they look is the internet. In fact, nearly three quarters of adults polled say they'd use the internet for advice on child mental health issues. There are a lot of good online resources offering advice and information and numerous discussion forums for sharing experience of mental ill health.  But with professionals and volunteers who come into contact with children identified as key in spotting the signs of mental problems (and as with physical illness, the earlier these conditions are identified, the better) - a targeted resource for them is needed. MindEd, an online tool launching today, contains bite-size learning , individually tailored to equip any one of the one million professionals and volunteers working with children and young people - including teachers, sports coaches, police, healthcare professionals, social workers and many more - with the skills to support and identify children with mental health conditions.  It aims to speed up the time it takes to identify a child with a mental health problem and put them on the path to the most appropriate support and where necessary, the right treatment.  It's free, available to everyone, and easy to use. All too often I see children and young people who enter the health system when they've been struggling with a mental health problem for a long time.   Better support early on - including specific mental health leads in schools and tailored online support for professionals - could be key to catching issues early.  And in a world of squeezed budgets and resource pressure, we need to make sure resources are being directed in the right way; including into the classroom and onto the web. ",

        "article": "\"I get so anxious if I want to go out to things. I live with my Mum because I don't want to live on my own. I can't do money. I wish I could.\"  Chris Steel is 40 years old. He is remarkably friendly and engaging, and is happiest when he is on stage acting in plays such as George Orwell's Animal Farm.  As a child, his caring nature led him to take to the bedside of a victim of the Hillsborough disaster, with such compassion and diligence he was given an award by former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  Chris is great to take to parties... but he is too trusting\u201d But he is unable to go out alone - once, when he did, his openness towards strangers and difficulty in understanding when he is in danger meant he lent his phone to a stranger, who stole it.  He has severe anxiety, and needs constant reassurance from the people around him.   Chris has Williams Syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder affecting around one in 18,000 people in Britain. It has often been dubbed the 'opposite of autism'.  People with WS are empathetic, social, friendly and endearing but they tend to have a low IQ, making tasks such as counting money difficult.  They can feel anxious over stimuli such as the buzzing of a bee, or the texture of food.  The need for reassurance in some cases can leave children of loving households calling 999 and feigning an emergency, as they crave adult attention so much. WS, first identified in 1961, can also cause heart problems, developmental delays, and learning disabilities.  For the psychological side of the disorder, acting can play to the strengths of people with WS. Chris says: \"I am good at reeling people in and being a character in different things.\" He acts with a charity called Mind the Gap, based in Bradford, near his home town of Bingley in West Yorkshire, and cites the time he was a pirate in a play called Treasure Island as amongst his favourites.  When he was a child, and visiting his father in hospital, Chris met  when he was crushed in the Hillsborough stadium disaster in 1989.  Chris befriended Tony, and stayed, loyally, by his bedside for weeks. \"Chris can talk to anyone and doesn't need a response,\" his mother Judy says.  It can be difficult when you see the surge of funding for the tidal wave of autism\u201d Judy says he is also \"great to take to parties\" as he happily introduces himself to new people.  But there is a flip side of this social ease. Judy says Chris is \"too trusting\", and has been taken advantage of.  She said he also needs people around him to be happy and guide him in what opinions he should have.  People with WS may make prolonged eye-contact, and be over-engaging, which can put them in danger. There are also further aspects of the disorder which can land them in hot water.  Lizzie Hurst, chief executive at the Williams Syndrome Foundation, says: \"People [with the disorder] conduct themselves in a way that makes them extremely vulnerable.  \"They don't have the cognitive ability to match their linguistic age. \"There is a classic autistic profile to which Williams Syndrome is the polar opposite. People can gauge the mood of a crowd and adopt without understanding the nuances of the situation.\" Ms Hurst says there were \"questions to be raised\" over whether people with WS could be legally responsible for themselves. \"I would say they cannot,\" she adds.  She is working to raise the profile of the disorder amongst GPs, as she says only one in 40 GPs will encounter the disorder and babies with WS can be difficult to identify.  Facial features in young children include a small, upturned nose, long upper lip, wide mouth, full lips, small chin and a white lacy pattern on the eye's iris.   Anxiety can be made worse if the disorder is not diagnosed, she said, as people feel even more isolated. Ms Hurst's charity does not get any funding from the government, relying on fundraising and donations. She puts on barbecues, Christmas parties and holidays for people with WS and their families.  \"I think the government should do more,\" she says. \"It can be difficult when you see the surge of funding for the tidal wave of autism.  \"WS people are just as needing as other people with mental disorders and in many ways they are more needing of support and attention, and that all comes at a price.\"  People with WS do not have a lower life expectancy than other people, and some may go on to get jobs, most often in a voluntary capacity, where their helpful nature can be useful.  Dr Debbie Riby, senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Durham University, has been working on the disorder for 12 years.  Anybody can have a child with Williams Syndrome\u201d She says WS occurs when part of chromosome seven is deleted, which happens sporadically.  \"Anybody can have a child with Williams Syndrome,\" she says.  Dr Riby says there is no pre-natal screening, but often doctors can pick up clues if a young child has heart murmurs, and problems putting on weight. She has been running parent focus groups to understand the anxiety side of WS to come up with practical steps families can take to help themselves keep their children calm and happy.  Dr Riby says: \"The work around Williams Syndrome used to focus on the theoretical side. I wanted to focus on the practical side. There is still an awful lot that we can do.  \"The most important thing is for us to think about how we can use research to support families.\"   ",

        "article": "US researchers have built a wirelessly powered pacemaker the size of a grain of rice and implanted it in a rabbit. They were able to hold a metal plate a few centimetres above the rabbit's chest and use it to regulate the animal's heartbeat. If such medical implants could be made to work in humans, it could lead to smaller devices that are safer to fit. The findings are published  . The researchers from Stanford University hope their development could also eventually dispense with the bulky batteries and clumsy recharging systems that are currently a feature of such devices. The central discovery was a new type of wireless power transfer that could safely penetrate deep inside the body, using roughly the same power as a cell phone. \"We need to make these devices as small as possible to more easily implant them deep in the body,\" said co-author Dr Ada Poon, from Stanford's department of electrical engineering. There are broadly two categories of electromagnetic wave that have been considered until now: far-field and near-field. Far-field waves, like those broadcast from radio towers, can travel long distances, but either bounce off the body harmlessly, or are absorbed as heat. Near-field waves can be safely used, but they can only transfer power over short distances. The researchers were able to design a device that blends the safety of near-field waves with the reach of far-field waves. \"With this method, we can safely transmit power to tiny implants in organs like the heart or brain, well beyond the range of current near-field systems,\" said John Ho, a graduate student in Dr Poon's lab.

        "article": "Smokers who use e-cigarettes to quit are more likely to succeed than those who use willpower alone or buy nicotine replacement therapies, such as patches or gum, a study suggests. The survey of nearly 6,000 smokers found a fifth had quit with the aid of e-cigarettes. That was 60% higher than those who did not use the devices, the study said. The University College London team said they were \"cautiously positive\" about the role e-cigarettes could play. E-cigarette use has shot up in recent years. Action on Smoking and Health estimate there are more than 2m people using them - triple the number from two years ago. Half of smokers have tried them compared to 8% in 2010. Users experience the sensation of smoking by inhaling a vapour which contains a concentration of nicotine. But they remain controversial. The Welsh government wants to restrict their use in public places, because of fears they normalise smoking.  However, lead researcher Prof Robert West, one of the UK's leading experts in this field, said: \"E-cigarettes could substantially improve public health because of their widespread appeal and the huge health gains associated with stopping smoking.\" But he also pointed out that despite the findings - published in the journal Addiction - by far the most effective way of quitting was to use NHS stop smoking services which tripled the odds of a smoker quitting when compared to buying nicotine replacement treatments without specialist help. And he added: \"Some public health experts have expressed concern that widespread use of e-cigarettes could 're-normalise' smoking. However, we are tracking this very closely and see no evidence of it. \"Smoking rates in England are declining, quitting rates are increasing and regular e-cigarette use among never smokers is negligible.\" E-cigarettes are currently not available on the NHS, but the drugs regulator the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is looking to licence them as medicines from 2016. Prof West said it was too early to say whether and which e-cigarette products could be made available, as there needed to be more research into the safety of long-term use. However, he said from what is currently known the contents of the e-cigarette vapours will be much less risky than smoking. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"E-cigarettes are not risk free, but they carry a lower risk to health than smoking tobacco and may help people who want to stop smoking. \"Any e-cigarette products that are licensed as medicines can be made available on the NHS. We will continue to closely monitor all emerging research.\" ",

        "article": "The Scottish government has launched a competition aimed at improving standards of catering in the health service. Chefs and catering teams will compete to provide meals for 100 people which are locally sourced and meet nutritional guidelines.   The winning menu will be rolled out across the whole of NHS Scotland. However, critics of the Good Food Challenge 2014 say it is a poor use of NHS finances. Hospitals in Scotland and Wales are required to meet national nutritional standards. However the last time the standard of catering was assessed in Scotland was in 2010, when a report found that one in five hospitals failed to meet the nutritional needs of patients. Since then the Scottish government says more has been done to improve patients' nutrition.   All patients are screened for malnutrition on admission, and wards also operate \"protected mealtimes\" to make sure patients are not interrupted by medical procedures while eating their meals. Last year Scotland's biggest health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, admitted that it spent an average of just over \u00a34 a day per patient.  Its catering budget had been cut by almost \u00a31m in the previous year.   Scotland has not seen the same level of dissatisfaction with hospital meals as England, where the Campaign for Better Hospital Food has been launched by the charity Sustain.   But BBC Scotland has been contacted by a mother who said the standard of food given to her son, who is receiving long-term treatment at the Sick Kids' Hospital in Edinburgh, was \"terrible\". She claimed main meals were \"highly processed\" and \"usually cold\" while puddings were \"cake and custard - school dinner style\" and \"never appetising\". The woman added: \"I find it pretty shocking that children with serious illnesses who need good nutrition get fed this junk food.  \"It's hard enough caring for an ill child without having to fret at every meal time about what they will eat and whether you should go out of the hospital to get them something else. \"I bet if a manager ate them for a week things would change.\" Nick Taylor, who spent six weeks in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary after a motorbike accident in 2012, said the biggest issue he experienced was food being either \"dried out or developing a skin across the top\" by the time it was served to patients. We are taking a range of steps to help people make better food choices, taking account of food's healthiness, quality, seasonality and freshness\u201d Mr Taylor added: \"I was lucky because due to my injuries I had to eat 4,000 plus calories per day so I was given an additional menu which included things like chips and baked potatoes. \"So I was able to make the menus work for me a lot easier than other people on the ward. Some of the food was actually OK.\" Mr Taylor said the rest of the care he received on the word was \"phenomenal\". Health Minister Alex Neil launched the chefs competition during a visit to the catering department of St John's hospital in Livingston, where more than 1,500 meals are prepared every day.   Mr Neil said: \"Scotland is known as a land of food and drink with some of the best natural produce in the world. Despite this Scotland still has one of the poorest diet-related health records in the developed world.  \"Whatever the reasons for our dietary habits, the Scottish government is determined that our culture must change if we are to prosper as a nation.  \"That is why we are taking a range of steps to help people make better food choices, taking account of food's healthiness, quality, seasonality and freshness.\" Mr Neil said \"huge progress\" had already been made in the Scottish NHS, with a nutritional database helping health boards to analyse recipes and ensure meals are nutritionally balanced and match patients' individual needs. He added: \"The NHS Good Food Challenge 2014 is an excellent opportunity for our committed catering teams to show what they can deliver and to come up with new recipes that are tasty, healthy and can be shared across the NHS.\" Regional heats are expected to take place over the summer, with the final towards the end of the year.

        "article": "A major investigation into whether mobile phones and other wireless technologies affect children's mental development is getting under way. The study - funded by the government and industry - will track 2,500 11- and 12-year-olds from September. It will look at their cognitive ability - thinking skills, memory and attention - and then repeat the tests in 2017. The researchers say \"very little\" is known about what impact these technologies have on children. The World Health Organization has said research in this area is of the \"highest priority\". More than 160 secondary schools in the outer London area will receive invitations to enrol pupils into the study. Much of the research into mobile phone use has focused on adults and in particular, the risk of brain cancer. No evidence of harm has been established to date. Nonetheless, NHS advice is that children under the age of 16 should use mobile phones only for essential purposes and, where possible, with hands-free kits. The theory has been put forward that children's brains may be more susceptible because they are still developing. This research - led by Imperial College London - will put that idea to the test by asking children and their parents about their use of mobile phones and wireless devices, such as tablets, as well as analysing data from operators. The 11-12 age group is particularly important as many children get mobiles at that age to coincide with starting secondary school. Some 70% of that age group now own a mobile. Lead investigator Dr Mireille Toledano said: \"The advice to parents is based on the precautionary principle given in absence of available evidence and not because we have evidence of any harmful effects.  \"As mobile phones are a new and widespread technology central to our lives, carrying out the study is important in order to provide the evidence base with which to inform policy and through which parents and their children can make informed life choices.\" The researchers will now be writing to 160 secondary schools in the outer London area asking pupils to take part.

        "article": "People in Wales needing bariatric surgery to help lose weight have to meet stricter criteria than patients in England, a report has found. There are around 7,000 patients in Wales who could benefit from surgery but they have to meet a stricter set of guidelines than recommended. It also found that only one of Wales' seven health boards provides all the weight management services they should. Leading doctors have said support for obesity treatments is \"patchy\". Currently in Wales you have to be twice the weight you should be [to qualify] and have significant obesity-related co-morbidities\u201d And one surgeon said the number of bariatric operations performed should triple. The report for the Welsh assembly's Health and Social Care Committee found obese patients in Wales had to meet stricter standards than those recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) when accessing help. Jonathan Barry, one of Wales' only two bariatric surgeons, told BBC Wales: \"There is a disparity between entry criteria [for surgery] in England and Wales. \"Currently in Wales you have to be twice the weight you should be [to qualify] and have significant obesity-related co-morbidities.\" He said at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, where he works, 67 patients are waiting for bariatric surgery but he said they could operate on up to 220 people per year. Currently obesity care is divided into four levels - level one starts with help from GPs and it leads up to level four which is bariatric surgery or other medical help. The report focused on levels three and four, with three involving comprehensive weight management services at a hospital level. At present only one health board, Aneurin Bevan, offers level three services. Mr Barry said a roll-out of level three provision across Wales would ensure only the correct patients were being referred for interventions such as surgery. \"There are some people who don't need surgery,\" he said. \"They need other help. They may fall outside the criteria for surgery and they have to be looked after in their own locality.\" He backed a committee recommendation to open a second bariatric unit in north Wales.  Media requires JavaScript to play. He added: \"We need to maximise the throughput of patients.\" The Royal College of Physicians backed the report's call for the Welsh government to fully implement its All Wales Obesity Pathway which would ensure patients everywhere had access to the higher level services. Health and social care committee chair David Rees said: \"Sufficient provision of specialist dietary, physical, and behavioural support is so important in order to avoid the invasive and drastic option of surgery, which can lead to long-term consequences as well as benefits for patients.  \"In our view surgery should only be seen as a last resort.\" The Welsh government said it would respond to the report in due course.

        "article": "Financial belts are being tightened in many areas - including medical research. But scientists say funding for such work is crucial, for the UK's research industry as well as for patients. In this week's Scrubbing Up,  Dr John Moore-Gillon, a respiratory health expert and honorary medical adviser at the British Lung Foundation, suggests the solution in the case of the asbestos-related cancer, mesothelioma, could be to turn to the insurance industry - and that this could be a model for supporting other areas of research. Each year, the insurance industry pays out hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation to people who have developed mesothelioma - a cancer of the outer covering of the lung - as a result of exposure to asbestos at work.  With the UK having the highest rates of mesothelioma in the world, it is estimated that these payments will cost the insurance industry in excess of \u00a311bn over the coming years. A far more profound cost is borne, though, by those actually living with this often very painful disease.  With no cure and little by way of effective treatments, mesothelioma can act with devastating speed.  Fewer than one in 10 sufferers are alive just three years after diagnosis, and many survive just a matter of months.  Compensation can help a family cope financially, but nothing makes up for the loss of a loved one. Well-funded medical research is essential if this situation is to improve - but such funding remains shamefully low, with that for mesothelioma lagging well behind levels invested in diseases, like skin cancer, that kill similar numbers of people. With about 60,000 people expected to die of mesothelioma in the UK over the next 30 years unless new treatments are found, the need to address this funding shortfall is urgent.  It could also fundamentally change, in the long term, the way we think about funding medical research.  \u201d But with public finances still tight, the key question is: how can we afford this extra investment without cutting back elsewhere? One solution is to work with the insurance industry. If, each year, insurers invested in mesothelioma research just a tiny fraction of the amount they will end up paying out in compensation - for example, just 0.05% of that \u00a311bn - it would absolutely transform mesothelioma research.  What is loose change for a multi-billion pound global industry could prove life-saving for thousands. And what is more, as treatments improve, and more mesothelioma patients live healthy, fulfilling and economically productive lives, the amount of compensation insurers would have to pay out would fall.  It's a win-win situation that should save the industry money. This principle of turning potential private sector beneficiaries into benefactors may sound unorthodox.  However, I believe such approaches to medical research funding will be crucial in future, not only to cope with the burgeoning health problems presented by our ageing population and modern lifestyle, but to ensure that diseases like mesothelioma aren't neglected.  Of course, it wouldn't address all our research-funding needs, across all disease areas.   And making it work will require a level of co-operation between politicians and industry that, frustratingly, we haven't yet seen for mesothelioma, even though both sides publicly support a deal.  However, with mesothelioma, we have an outstanding opportunity.  If government and industry pass this test, it may not only help the tens of thousands of people who will otherwise die of mesothelioma over the coming years it could also fundamentally change, in the long term, the way we think about funding medical research.

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Nurse Louise Baxendale says her patients are very inspiring Nurses are under more scrutiny than ever before. Following the Stafford Hospital scandal the profession has been forced to defend itself against accusations it has forgotten how to care. But what is life really like for those on the frontline? Everyone can have a bad day at work: unreasonable requests from a boss, perhaps a mountain of work that never seems to shrink.  But for ward sister Louise Baxendale, a bad day means the death of a teenager. She is the lead nurse for London's University College Hospital's 18-bed teenage cancer ward, part of the hospital's specialist adolescent unit, the biggest of its kind in Europe.  You meet patients at all stages of the journey, but you can make a difference to all of them\u201d It means each and every day is spent caring for 13 to 19-year-olds sick, in pain and struggling to come to terms with their condition. Figures from the  , which partly funds the unit, show seven teenagers a day are diagnosed with the disease. Leukaemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma are the most common cancers among this age group.  Bowel cancer, which last week claimed the life of Stephen Sutton, the 19-year-old who help raise \u00a33.2m for charity, is seen - although is much rarer. So what attracted Louise, 35, to such a demanding role?  \"I have been a nurse for 13 years and this is my favourite job,\" she says.  \"I have worked in A&E and with people with respiratory conditions, but when I started here I just realised it was what I wanted to do.  \"The patients are such characters and the care you give can make a real difference.\" She adds: \"The thing you have to do is be upbeat. There is no room for negativity. Of course, that can be hard and it is difficult getting it right.\" Louise describes how treating three different patients in the course of just one day proves her point. The first, she says, had just been given a cancer diagnosis and were scared and upset. In the next room  there was a patient at the end of life. They had chosen to die on the unit with their family and the nurses and other health staff they had got to know around them.  But the next room could not have been more different.  The patient was at the end of treatment and planning for a fancy dress party they were going to attend. Understandably, the patient was - in Louise's words - so excited they were \"on the ceiling\".  \"The thing is you meet patients at all stages of the journey, but you can make a difference to all of them,\" says Louise.  \"You have to shape yourself to your patient. You have to get to know them really well to make a difference. I came into nursing to make a difference.  \"Sometimes it is just the simple things like tucking them in with a blanket can mean the world.\"  I spent time with Louise on National Nurses Day last Monday - two days before the death of Stephen Sutton. As ward sister she divides her time between management tasks and providing care. That in itself provides challenges. \"You have to do a lot of juggling. There may be a meeting to go to, a shelf that needs fixing, HR asking me questions.  \"But my number one priority is always care and safety. That comes first and if it means saying 'hang on I can't deal with those requests I'm needed on the ward' then so be it.\" Louise's day starts before 8am - often ending after 6pm - with the handover meeting with the night staff, followed by a bed meeting with the rest of the paediatric and adolescent nursing teams to check on what staffing levels are like. While debate continues about staffing ratios on adult general wards, in the teenage cancer unit - and the general teenage ward which is linked to it but run by another ward sister Rebecca Mortimer - staffing ratios are already strictly monitored. On the cancer ward there is often one nurse to two or three patients sometimes one to one, while on the general ward, which sees a wide variety of patients from road traffic accident victims to diabetes patients, it is one to four or five during the day. After staffing levels have been checked - the trust has an in-house bank of nurses which it can deploy when there are shortages - it is then back on to the ward to help out with the care being provided.  That involves giving medications including the chemotherapy drugs that many patients are on, but part of it is also about spending time with patients. These are children who are going through hell\u201d \"You do develop a relationship with them,\" says Louise. \"Sometimes they just need to talk to you. I have done jigsaws with patients. It is about making life as normal as it can be and injecting fun where you can.  \"We have the physios come in and during one session the other week we had all the staff doing the limbo under a tape.\" To help the teenagers cope with their stay in hospital - which can last weeks even months at a time - there is an activity room. It is equipped with everything a teenager would need. There is a pool table, flat-screen TV and DVD, an Xbox console and arts and crafts facilities. Louise says: \"It very popular, especially the Xbox with the boys. They love playing FIFA. We have to nag them to get off it. It can be midnight or even later and then want to have another game. We have to tell them no. Then in the mornings they won't get up. You've got to remember they are teenagers after all.\" One of them is 17-year-old Dami Oguntoyinbo, who has been on the unit almost constantly since last August after being diagnosed with leukaemia. Seventy days after having a bone marrow transplant he is on the brink of being discharged. \"I can't wait to get out, obviously. About the only thing I'll miss is the nurses. They have been great. It is really tough. After my transplant I was really ill and had to stay in my room. They really looked after me, kept my spirits up.\" Of course, Dami is one of the lucky ones, as Louise admits.  \"Not all of them do survive. That is very difficult to deal with as you get to know your patients really well. You have to stay strong.  \"Burnout is a real issue for us nurses. That is why the team is so important. We all look after each, keep an eye out for each other. But we know we have to be there for our patients.  \"These are children who are going through hell.\" ",
