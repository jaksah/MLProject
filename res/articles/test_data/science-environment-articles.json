The big aerospace concern was declared the winner at the latest meeting of the European Space Agency's (Esa) Industrial Policy Committee (IPC). A contract valued in the hundreds of millions of euros will be signed by Esa and Airbus in due course. The existing Metop series, as it is known, has a profound impact on the quality of weather forecasting. The satellites' sensors gather profiles of atmospheric conditions, layer by layer. Studies comparing all the different types of meteorological observations (including surface weather stations, balloons and aeroplanes, etc) have found Metop data to have the biggest single contribution to the accuracy of the 24-hour look ahead, at around 25%. The improved forecasts of storms and other extreme events are estimated to be worth billions of euros annually in terms of lives saved and property damage avoided. Thursday's IPC decision is therefore a critically important one for the continent, by ensuring there is continuity of data when the existing series of Metop satellites is retired. \"Metop first generation has established itself as an essential series of satellites for weather forecasting. It gives the most detailed measurements from space for such purposes,\" explained Esa programme manager Graeme Mason. \"The first objective of the second generation (SG) is simply to continue the observations without a gap because we cannot do without them. But we want also to improve the measurements - to improve the resolution, to see finer details in the atmosphere. \"And the third objective is to make additional measurements, and we'll be flying a couple of new instruments,\" he told BBC News.  Metop-SG will carry 11 instruments spread across two platforms. This is a major difference from the first generation series which packs all the sensors on to a single satellite. Two of these spacecraft have so far been launched; a third will go up at the end of the decade. Another major difference between the two series will be the approach to end-of-life decommissioning.  The first series will be de-orbited by nudging them down from their roughly 800km-high operational altitude until they are caught by the atmosphere, and pulled in to burn to destruction. This should take no more than 25 years, to comply with international space-debris guidelines.  The disposal of the second generation, however, will be faster and more controlled. The satellites will fly with bigger fuel tanks and more powerful thrusters, enabling them to target their destructive dive on to an uninhabited region of the South Pacific.  The whole procedure should take just a month.  Esa says the accumulation of old hardware in orbit is becoming a significant issue and the plans for Metop-SG demonstrate the seriousness with which it is tackling the problem.  The competitors for the SG contract were given an additional two months to work out how best to carry out the de-orbiting. It will mean two thirds of the fuel on each spacecraft being reserved just for the end-of-life manoeuvres.  The first pair of Metop-SG satellites should launch in 2021/22.  The third and final pair will likely go up in the 2030s, ensuring continuity of data deep into the 2040s. Airbus will use its facilities in Germany, France and the UK for most of the work on Metop-SG.  and follow me on Twitter:  ",

Scientists in the UK and US chose the birds based on their rarity, but also how distinctive their appearance, behaviour and evolutionary history was. The list of birds contains several of the world's largest and most striking, as well as other unusual species threatened with extinction. Included are the tooth-billed pigeon, known as the little dodo, the Philippine's eagle and a type of kiwi. Scientists at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), UK and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, US created the list as part of the   programme, which seeks to document the most uniquely vulnerable species on the planet. Details of the exercise are published in the journal Current Biology. At   is a bird called the giant ibis. The largest member of the ibis and spoonbill family, the   stands over a metre tall, weighs 4.2kg and is the national bird of Cambodia. Despite this, fewer than 230 pairs remain. As well as being more distantly related to other members of its family, the giant ibis is expected to further decline in numbers due to habitat destruction and the predation of its eggs by mammals. At   is the New Caledonian owlet-nightjar. With only two specimens and a small number of sightings, little is known about this enigmatic species, which has not been seen since 1998. It continues to elude birdwatchers and researchers, with fewer than 50 assumed to survive. At   is the Californian condor, a bird with a three-metre wide wingspan that has been the subject of intensive conservation efforts. Exactly how many Californian condors once lived remains unknown, yet by 1981 the wild population numbered just 21 birds. Despite numerous breeding efforts since that time, a chick did not hatch again in the wild until 2003. At   is the New Zealand kakapo, a flightless, nocturnal bird that is the heaviest of all parrots. It is now extinct throughout its natural range, and survives only on three small, intensively managed islands. Dedicated conservation efforts have seen the population increase slowly to 125 individuals. And at  , the kagu, a bird endemic to Grand Terre, the largest island of New Caledonia. Another highly unusual, almost flightless bird, due to its startling ash-white plumage, the kagu is known locally as the 'ghost of the forest'. It is the only representative of an entire taxonomic group, resembling something between a small heron and a rail. Also on the list are 95 other unique species, such as the Forest owlet, thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1997, almost 113 years after the last confirmed record, the Christmas Island frigate bird, and the tooth-billed pigeon, a bird thought extinct for most of a decade, until it was  . Lead author Prof Walter Jetz from Yale University and Imperial College London, said: \"These highly distinct and endangered birds often occur far away from places that are species-rich or are already on conservation's radar.\" \"Half of the 100 highest ranked EDGE bird species are receiving little or no conservation attention,\" added Carly Waterman, EDGE Programme Manager at ZSL. \"We lament the extinction of the dodo, but without action we stand to lose one of its closest relatives, the tooth-billed pigeon or 'little dodo', and many other extraordinary birds.\" Join BBC Nature on   and Twitter  .

James Oxley said that unlike some EU countries, the UK does not have legal requirements on the size of hutches, or that rabbits be kept in pairs. Writing in the World Rabbit Science Association's journal, he said rules in the Animal Welfare Act 2006 were \"non-specific\". He has also suggested a review of how existing law impacts on rabbits. Mr Oxley,  , said the review could also look at how the UK compared with other EU countries in its protection of the animals.  In a letter published in the journal World Rabbit Science, he said: \"It has recently been noted that there are an estimated one to 1.7 million rabbits within the UK. \"Currently there have only been several small-scale studies in the UK which have looked at the management, personality and behaviour of pet rabbits and the views, personality and attitudes of new and current rabbit owners.\" Mr Oxley said one study of pet owners had found that 60% of them planned to have an enclosure which was either the same, or smaller, than the recommend minimum size. The research also suggested that 41% intended to keep their rabbit on its own. Animal welfare charities the PDSA and Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund say a hutch should be no smaller than 6ft (1.8m) long, 2ft wide and 2ft high. Both recommend pet owners provide rabbits with much larger enclosures than the minimum size, as well as a big run. In the wild, rabbits live in social groups within large territories. UK environment department Defra said owners were required to provide their pets with a suitable environment and proper exercise. A spokesperson said: \"Existing legislation provides adequate protection for the welfare of domestic pets including rabbits - anyone who fails to provide for their pet's welfare needs may face prosecution.  \"There are no proposals to amend the legislation.\" In Scotland, the campaign Rabbits Require Rights has a petition calling for rabbit welfare-specific legislation. It said rabbits were the UK's third most popular pet, but also the most neglected. The Scottish government said it was not planning any changes to the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006, but would keep it under review. A spokesman said: \"Provisions within this legislation include making it an offence to cause/allow unnecessary suffering and abandonment.  \"It is an offence not to ensure that an animal's needs are met to the extent required by good practice.\" He added: \"Guides to good practice for keeping rabbits are available and updated in view of changing knowledge and understanding.\" UK-based Mr Oxley has been working with Switzerland's Dr Elodie Briefer on the rabbit-owner interaction research. Dr Briefer, an expert on animal behaviour, has an interest in how birds and mammals use vocal signals to send out information about their species, body size, age, dominance status and mood. In collaboration with Mr Oxley, she produced a questionnaire for rabbit owners. They were asked about how often they talked to their pet, and about the tone that they used while doing so. Other questions asked whether people had their rabbits with them while they relax in front of the TV, whether they believed talking to rabbits calmed them down when they were stressed and how intelligent they thought the animals were. The results of the survey are now being processed. ",

        "article": "Plans to restrict wind farms to seas around Britain will need much larger subsidies from consumers, experts say.  suggest that the Conservative Party will include a pledge to limit onshore turbines in next year's election manifesto. But a member of a working group reviewing UK wind energy said this would require increased subsidies of around \u00a3300,000 per turbine per year. Prof Richard Green said this would have a knock-on effect on electricity bills. Long unpopular among some Conservative MPs from rural constituencies, onshore wind turbines appear to have incurred the wrath of the Prime Minister as well.  That's about \u00a3300,000 per year per turbine that is moved from onshore to offshore\u201d Reports suggest that he wants next year's election manifesto to include a promise to limit subsidies and toughen planning laws to make wind farms unviable in the countryside.  Increased emphasis is to be placed on offshore farms, although it is known that these are more expensive to build and run. Speaking at the launch of a new report from the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) on wind energy in the UK, Prof Green said that strategy would come at a significant cost in increased subsidies.  Under government plans, onshore wind turbines will receive \u00a390 per megawatt hour of electricity generated from 2017. But offshore turbines get more aid, around \u00a3140 per megawatt hour. \"That's about \u00a3300,000 per year per turbine that is moved from onshore to offshore,\" said Prof Green who is an economist. \"That is the cost in additional subsidy, at the rates the government is planning to pay in about 2017. Those subsidies are recovered through electricity bills.\" According to the RAEng review, there are around 4,800 onshore turbines either operational or under construction in the UK as of February this year. Another 1,800 have received planning permission.  Offshore there are 1,400 either operational or under construction with another 700 having permission to build.  The report points out that onshore wind energy is more expensive than electricity from coal or gas, but wind is one of the cheapest sources of low carbon power. However, if the plans to limit onshore wind come to pass, it will mean that meeting legally binding, carbon reduction targets become much more difficult.  \"If you want to decarbonise then it will make it harder,\" said Prof Gareth Harrison from the University of Edinburgh, another member of the working group.  \"You are pushed towards more expensive options, you are ultimately pushed towards more carbon intensive sources, solar PV is arguably worse than large wind in many respects.\"  \"It does run counter to the need to decarbonise.\"  In their report, the engineers say that wind energy can contribute about 20% of the UK's electricity demand without the need for a significant upgrade to the network. Beyond that level though, it gets more difficult.  \"Once you get beyond 20%, life becomes more interesting,\" said Prof Roger Kemp, from Lancaster University, another member of the review team. \"Wind energy has much lower inertia, and so the stability of the frequency can become less good, that's something that has to be thought about.\" The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said that wind was a critical part of the energy mix, the government supported the development of onshore wind in suitable areas and that planning reforms had given communities greater say over the siting of wind farms in their areas. Concerns over the costs of wind energy have also been highlighted by the Renewable Energy Foundation who say that subsidy payments for energy that is generated when there is little demand for power, are at a record high.  They point to the fact that in March this year, the government paid \u00a38.7m to wind farms not to generate electricity.  The Foundation says that these \"constraints payments\" were necessitated by difficulties in exporting excess wind power from Scottish farms. Over the past 12 months, the National Grid says it made special payments of around \u00a3300m to energy companies to turn their power off to balance the system.  Follow Matt  . ",

There have been some signs near the town of Doksy suggesting a wolf may be in the region,  . But wolves haven't roamed free in Bohemia since the late 19th Century. Right now, there is probably just one wolf or maybe a pair, says environmental expert Miroslav Kutal. The animal is likely to have strayed into Bohemia from the border regions of Germany and Poland, where the wolf population has been thriving.  But   - especially in former military zones and in the mountainous border regions - seem to be good for breeding. This is something to be encouraged, he adds, since wolves can regulate the deer population and draw tourists to the area. But the arrival of poachers could become a concern. . ",

        "article": "Reducing pollution from cars has been cheaper and easier than UN experts thought, a draft report says.  The UN's climate panel has admitted it underestimated the huge gains in weight and fuel efficiency achieved by car manufacturers.  But the panel says all the improvements will be swamped by the future growth in global traffic.  That is unless governments improve public transport, tax motorists and plan cities for walking and cycling.  The report, seen by BBC News, warns that transport will become the biggest source of CO2 emissions unless politicians act firmly. It points out that the majority of homes in urban centres are yet to be built, but raises doubts about the capacity of governments in developing countries to plan cities that will avoid car dependency and pollution. The authors say in a background document: \"Without aggressive and sustained policies (to cut CO2 from cars and trucks), transport emissions could increase at a faster rate than emissions from any other sector and reach around 12 [billion tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent greenhouse gases per year] by 2050.  \"Transport demand per capita in developing and emerging economies is far lower than in [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries, but will increase at a much faster rate in the next decades, due to rising incomes and development of infrastructure.\" Transport currently produces 23% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Its growth has historically been linked to the amount of wealth in the economy, but the report says this link will have to be severed if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change (the catchphrase is \"decoupling\"). The report displays signs of optimism, noting that the growth in the use of light vans has slowed strongly in rich nations. It says: \"If pricing and other stringent policy options are implemented in all regions, substantial decoupling of transport GHG emissions from GDP growth seems possible.\" The report lists a host of measures to be used to combat increased emissions. Some will be controversial, others will be invisible.  They include: behavioural change leading to avoided journeys, internet shopping, a shift to public transport, better technology, low-carbon fuels, investments in related infrastructure and changes in cities to promote walking and cycling. The UK's leading expert on transport and the environment, Prof Julia King from Aston University, told BBC News: \"The automotive industry has brought energy efficiency technologies into vehicles faster than most people predicted and at lower cost. \"The result in the UK of technology acceleration, combined with fuel price increases and the impact of the recession, is that new car emissions fell to 130g/km - two years ahead of the EU deadline of 2015. The drop shows that regulation can work - the EU new car CO2 regulatory target and the US efficiency target seem to be driving the acceleration.\" Prof King said the rates of CO2 reduction were highest in the most expensive cars. \"Luxury saloon average new car emissions fell from 285g/km to below 200g/km - an amazing 30% reduction.  Of course, it is easier at the luxury end - in big vehicles, there is more to go at,\" she said. \"In large cars, a 1% reduction in mass gives about a 0.7% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.  Some studies suggest that this can deliver up to 33% reduction in emissions in large cars.\" Drivers have also benefited from better tyres, lubricating oils, driver information including gear change indicators, aerodynamics and low-energy electronics. Added to this long list is the gradual emergence of hybrid and electric vehicles. Prof King added a caveat: some of the emissions improvements may not be apparent to the average driver.  It seems that manufacturers are capitalising on new technology to pass the emissions test, rather than to benefit the ordinary motorist - so new cars are definitely better, but not quite as good as they appear. Also, perversely, as cars last longer, ultra-efficient vehicles will take longer to penetrate the fleet.   The UN's report confirms that regulation - often strongly resisted by the motor industry - can be very effective in getting emissions down and efficiency up. It talks about the need to ensure clean fuels. The EU's policy on blocking high-CO2 fuel from   from Europe is being fiercely resisted by Canada. The report says there is room for governments to shift more freight on to rail and water, but it warns that aircraft will remain a problem. Although big efficiency improvements are scheduled, aircraft are very long-lived. Despite all the optimism over technical advances, it says: \"Reducing transport emissions will be a daunting task, given the inevitable increases in demand.\" Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin ",

Professor Carl Heneghan said side effects included serious \"psychiatric adverse events, renal adverse events and metabolic adverse events\" Hundreds of millions of pounds may have been wasted on a drug for flu that works no better than paracetamol, a landmark analysis has said.  The UK has spent \u00a3473m on Tamiflu, which is stockpiled by governments globally to prepare for flu pandemics.   claimed the drug did not prevent the spread of flu or reduce dangerous complications, and only slightly helped symptoms. The manufacturers Roche and other experts say the analysis is flawed.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Barry Clinch from Roche said Tamiflu had been approved by 100 regulators around the world The antiviral drug Tamiflu was stockpiled from 2006 in the UK when some agencies were predicting that a pandemic of bird flu could kill up to 750,000 people in Britain. Similar decisions were made in other countries.  The drug was widely prescribed during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Drug companies do not publish all their research data. This report is the result of a colossal fight for the previously hidden data into the effectiveness and side-effects of Tamiflu.  It concluded that the drug reduced the persistence of flu symptoms from seven days to 6.3 days in adults and to 5.8 days in children. But the report's authors said drugs such as paracetamol could have a similar impact.  On claims that the drug prevented complications such as pneumonia developing, Cochrane suggested the trials were so poor there was \"no visible effect\". Another justification for stockpiling was to slow the spread of the disease to give time for a vaccine to be developed. The report's authors said \"the case for this is simply unproven\" and \"there is no credible way these drugs could prevent a pandemic\". It also claimed that the drug had a number of side-effects, including nausea, headaches, psychiatric events, kidney problems and hyperglycaemia.  Carl Heneghan, Professor of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford and one of the report's authors, told the BBC: \"I think the whole \u00a3500m has not benefited human health in any way and we may have harmed people.  \"Does a drug work?\" should be an easy question to answer. Yet after hundreds of millions of pounds, either down the drain or saving lives depending on your stance, this question is being asked of Tamiflu. It stems from the way drugs are approved. Pharmaceutical companies conduct trials, some but not all of the data is made publicly available and regulators decide if it works. It is estimated that, entirely legally, half of clinical trials have never been reported and that favourable data is more likely to published. The UK Public Accounts Committee said the lack of data available to researchers and doctors was \"of extreme concern\". So the Tamiflu saga raises another important question - what other drugs are we using that might not work as well as we thought? \"The system that exists for producing evidence on drugs is so flawed and open to misuse that the public has been misled.\"  Dr Tom Jefferson, a clinical epidemiologist and former GP, said: \"I wouldn't give it for symptom relief, I'd give paracetamol.\" The Cochrane Collaboration researchers have not placed the blame on any individual or organisation, instead saying there had been failings at every step from the manufacturers to the regulators and government.  However, there is disagreement about the findings and accusations that a simultaneous campaign to open up drug research is influencing the findings.  The pharmaceutical company Roche said \"we disagree with the overall conclusions\" and warned they could \"potentially have serious public health implications\". Its UK medical director, Dr Daniel Thurley, told the BBC News website: \"The definitive piece of research stands as the randomised control trials, which were shared with the regulators, which led to them in 100 countries around the world approving Tamiflu for treatment and prevention of flu.\" He said the Cochrane group had used the wrong statistics, which \"systematically underestimate the benefits\" of the drug, and used \"unorthodox\" methods to analyse the side-effects.  Media requires JavaScript to play. He concluded: \"One of the challenges we have here is actually knowing what they've done.\" Prof Wendy Barclay, who researches the influenza virus at Imperial College London, said reducing symptoms in children by 29 hours would be \"pretty beneficial\". She told the BBC: \"Tamiflu works as well as any drug we have now or [that] is on the cards.  \"Yes, I think they should replenish the stockpile. What else can you do if a pandemic strikes? We won't have a vaccine for the first six months.\"  It is a potential limitation of this study that the work has been carried out alongside campaigning on access to trial data\u201d She also questioned the validity of the research as it analysed the impact during seasonal flu: \"If it works a little bit in season flu, the chances are they'll work quite a lot better in a pandemic situation and get more people back to school and work.\" Kevin McConway, a professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said it was an \"impressive\" piece of work. He said: \"It is a potential limitation of this study that the work has been carried out alongside campaigning on access to trial data.  \"The writers of the review have a clear position in this controversy, and, although I personally do generally agree with their position, I feel it does at times lead to some confusion between reporting the results of the review of these particular drugs and commenting on the general position on access to and use of unpublished data.\" The Department of Health, which took the lead for the UK, said Britain was recognised as \"one of the best prepared countries in the world for a potential flu pandemic\" and \"our stockpile of antivirals is a key part of this. \"We regularly review all published data and will consider the Cochrane review closely.\" The World Health Organization, which classes Tamiflu as an essential medicine, said: \"We welcome a new and rigorous analysis of available data, and look forward to consideration of its findings after it appears.\"  ",

The Agency is now looking into the incident as news reports raised questions about whether Mr Abrams was certified to operate the drone. Mr Abrams said his initial investigation suggested that he lost control after someone else briefly took over flying the drone. Determining who in the crowd of competitors had stolen control would be tricky, he said, because smartphones could easily be used to carry out such an attack. ",

A clean getaway for the Soyuz carrying Sentinel-1a A Soyuz rocket has launched from French Guiana with the first satellite in the European Union's new multi-billion-euro Earth-observation programme. The Sentinel-1a spacecraft has been put in orbit on a mission to map the planet's surface using radar. It will be followed by a fleet of other satellites - also called Sentinels - over the next five years. Brussels is describing its   as the biggest ever effort to characterise our world. When the full satellite system is operational, it will be producing daily some eight terabytes of data to detail the state of Earth's land surface, its oceans and its atmosphere. European nations have so far committed 7.5bn euros (\u00a36.2bn; $10.3bn) to the project. But the vision for Copernicus is that it is unending - that every Sentinel satellite is replaced at the demise of its mission, ensuring there is continuity of information deep into this century. \"Once all the Sentinel satellites have been launched, the Copernicus programme will be the most efficient and fullest Earth-observation programme in the world,\" said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.   \"This investment will allow Europe to establish itself at the forefront of research and innovation in a cutting-edge sector - namely, space.  Many skilled jobs have been created and many more are yet to come.\" The Soyuz carrying the first radar observer lifted clear of the Sinnamary launch pad on the Guianese coast at 18:02 local time (21:02 GMT; 22:02 BST). The ride to an altitude of 699km took 23 minutes. A signal confirming a clean separation for Sentinel-1a from the rocket was received shortly afterwards. Controllers at the European Space Agency's (Esa) operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany, must now commission the spacecraft.  The first hours will be spent sending commands to the satellite to get it to unpack its solar wings and the panels of its radar instrument.  These were all folded to fit inside the Soyuz. The task should be complete by early morning on Friday, European time. Formal entry into service is expected in about three months' time, although it is likely that the platform will start imaging the Earth as early as next week to begin the process of instrument calibration. Radar has myriad uses, from monitoring shipping lanes for pollution or icebergs, to mapping land surfaces to track deforestation or the performance of rice production. However, a key use for Sentinel-1a will be in disaster response. Radar is especially good at detecting the extent of flood waters, and this type of image is also regularly employed following major earthquakes to assess the damage to infrastructure. Sentinel-1a will test a new laser-based data-relay system that will be at the heart of the Copernicus system. The technology, developed by German engineers, will not only handle more data than traditional downlinks but speed the information's receipt on Earth.   \"The laser terminal will reduce the access time to data from hours to minutes,\" explained Esa Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain. Copernicus uses a range of technologies to get a broad picture of the health status of the planet \"In the case of natural catastrophes, saving time will save lives.\" Five further Sentinel-themed missions with different types of sensors should be in orbit by 2019.  The idea is that the satellites are flown as pairs so that the revisit periods to locations on the Earth to take the next swath of images are kept as short as possible. Thus, a Sentinel-1b will be launched next year. Sentinels 1c and 1d will be sent up to take over observing duties when it looks like 1a and 1b might be about to fail.   In this way, Copernicus and its dedicated Sentinels will start to build continuous, cross-calibrated, long-term datasets. These will be a boon to climate studies. But the EU hopes the data will prove to be a powerful tool also to help design and enforce community-wide polices, covering diverse areas such as fish stocks management, air quality regulation, and keeping track of waste disposal practices. Copernicus is the EU's second major space project after the Galileo satellite-navigation system, which is also in the process of roll-out.

The merged island lies some 1,000km (621mi) south of Tokyo, the result of eruptions on the seafloor that have spewed enough material to rise above the water line. In November 2013, a new island sprouted near to Nishino-shima, another volcanic landmass that last expanded in the 70s. Four months later, the new and old islands are one island. The newer portion of the island - which was referred to as Niijima - is now larger than the original Nishino-shima landmass. The merged island is slightly more than 1km (3,280ft) across. According to Nasa, two cones have formed around the main volcanic vents and stand more than 60m above sea level. Volcanic lava flows are reported to be most active now on the south end of the island. The new landmass lies in the Ogasawara (Bonin) Island chain. ",

        "article": "Global investment in renewables fell by 14% during 2013, but the percentage of electricity generated by renewable sources still grew, a report shows. It said investment fell for the second year in a row because of cheaper technology, but also as a result of uncertainty surrounding energy policy. However, falling costs meant renewables accounted for 8.5% of the global electricity mix, up from 7.8% in 2012.  Renewables accounted for 43.6% of newly installed generation capacity in 2013. The report -   - was produced by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) and Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The assessment said the US $214.4bn (\u00a3129.2bn) worldwide investment in the renewable sector during 2013 was 23% below the 2011 record. One of the report's lead editors, UN energy expert Eric Usher, described 2013 as a \"mixed year\" for global renewable energy. Identifying the reasons behind the fall in investment, he explained: \"One of the major factors was the fall in the cost of equipment.  \"Another negative factor was a touch of policy uncertainty, which saw investors delay spending their money.\" He told BBC News that the fall in the cost of the clean energy technologies - particularly solar - had \"left some governments thinking that they had been paying too much and reviewed their subsidies\". Mr Usher added that while some nations, such as Germany, had been able to adapt very quickly, \"other nations have not handled it quite so well, causing nervousness among investors\". He explained that for a number of years, there was overcapacity in the sector and supply was greater than demand, making it difficult for firms to record a profit. But lower costs, improved efficiencies and market consolidation had allowed companies to return to profitability. Mr Usher observed that there were a number of positive signs during 2013, including the fact that the renewable energy sectors in a number of nations, particularly in Latin America, were able to grow completely free of government subsidies. He added: \"For the first time in 2013, China installed more new generation capacity using renewables than fossil fuels.  \"So it is a good sign for the sector that the world's largest emerging economy is taking the sector very seriously indeed.\" Responding to the assessment, Unep executive director Achim Steiner said: \"A long-term shift in investment over the next few decades towards a cleaner energy portfolio is needed to avoid dangerous climate change, with the energy sector accounting for around two-thirds of total greenhouse gas emissions.  \"The fact that renewable energy is gaining a bigger share of overall generation globally is encouraging. To support this further, we must re-evaluate investment priorities, shift incentives, build capacity and improve governance structures.\" The report's findings are being presented to a Future of Energy Summit in New York, US, which runs until Wednesday.

        "article": "This year, for the first time, efforts have been made to catch sharks off the shore of Western Australia and to shoot the biggest of them. The state has applied for permission to continue the programme for another three years - but it's a divisive policy with many bitter critics. Elyse Frankcom was diving with dolphins in the vast waters of Western Australia when she felt the jaws of a great white shark clamp around her legs. \"It just hit me,\" remembers the 22-year-old, who was violently pulled down from the surface by the 3.5m (11ft) shark in late 2010. \"I tried to punch and push it. I reached down to my foot and switched on [my shark shield]. That is the last thing I remember doing.\" The shield, which emits an electrical field designed to repel sharks, may have forced the animal to retreat, but when it released its grip, she sank. A tourist dived down to retrieve her, hauling her, unconscious and bleeding, to the surface. It took Frankcom months of physiotherapy to learn to walk again. The shark's jaw cut through the bone on one leg and tore muscles on the other - its teeth were found embedded in both. For weeks every step felt like \"hitting [my legs] with a baseball bat\". Yet, despite the pain and the narrow escape, Frankcom is one of thousands of Australians protesting against Western Australia's controversial culling of sharks. An unusually high number of fatal attacks - seven in just over three years, from August 2010 to November 2013 - prompted Western Australia's premier, Colin Barnett, to order baited hooks to be strung from floating drums near swimming, surfing and diving areas. Any great white, tiger shark or bull shark caught on the hooks is shot, if it exceeds 3m in length. The lines went up on 25 January, and the first shark was killed the following day (Australia Day) with four bullets to the head.  So far, more than 100 sharks have been snared. While some welcome the attempt to make the beaches safer, others see it as little more than a political stunt. Barnett, who was photographed at the start of the programme grinning and clutching  a large shark hook has declared that he has an \"overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia\". But opposition has been more intense than perhaps he anticipated. Protests have been unexpectedly large, and a swing of 6% towards the Green Party in a Senate by-election last weekend was widely attributed to the cull. Furthermore, the policy appears not to have halted shark attacks - the body of a diver who went missing, near Dawesville, south of Perth, on 29 March was later found with shark bites. And when a 4m-shark appeared 100m from the shore near Perth on Tuesday, critics were quick to claim it had been attracted by the smell of the bait on the hooks. Western Australia is not the first state to launch anti-shark policies that trouble environmentalists. Fixed nets were introduced around popular beaches in New South Wales as long ago as the 1930s, while Queensland uses a mixture of nets and hooks. Though neither state actively kills sharks, the measures often prove fatal anyway - of the 600-plus sharks caught in Queensland's nets in 2013, it's reported that only 32 made it out alive. And other animals, such as dugongs and dolphins, are at risk from the nets too. While Western Australia's hooks may kill less indiscriminately than nets, Natalie Banks, a scuba diving instructor who has organised protests in Perth attended by thousands, believes that attitudes have changed and that many more people are now uncomfortable with the idea of killing sharks. \"There has been a huge shift in mentality with regards to conservation to our marine life,\" she says. The cull, she insists, is \"a kneejerk reaction based purely on fear of the unknown\".  Banks is now working with the pressure group, Sea Shepherd, which maintains that many of the smaller sharks caught on the hooks and then released end up dying. Last week they posted   showing activists helping a 2.4m-long tiger shark recover, by holding its fins and propelling it through the water. This helped to re-oxygenate the shark's body, and after an hour-and-a-half it was strong enough to swim off. The group has also posted pictures of bleeding dying sharks, and of other by-catch - including two stingrays in the last week. The hooks are intended to snare only three species (bull sharks, tiger sharks and great whites) but the government of Western Australia acknowledged that in the first three weeks they caught, in addition to 63 tiger sharks, two mako sharks and one blacktip shark. More than three-quarters of the sharks snared (78%) were under the 3m length limit, and none were great whites. Cull opponents typically put forward policies such as tagging potentially dangerous sharks, shark spotting networks, phone apps to raise the alarm and barriers that keep sharks out without trapping them - plus the use of shields like the one that saved Frankcom. The surfers, the people that go out everyday - they accept the risk\u201d The state government already carries out some tagging (which allows the movement of sharks to  ), has increased helicopter patrols, and is studying the effectiveness of shark deterrents. \"The preservation of human life is our number one priority and these measures are designed to do that, with minimum impact to the surrounding environment,\" Fisheries Minister Troy Buswell  , when the hook policy was unveiled.  On Perth's popular Cottesloe Beach, as tourists bake in the sun and school children attend swimming lessons in the ocean, reactions to the cull are mixed. \"Kill them,\" urges one young male swimmer with salty blond hair.  Others are against the hooks. \"They are a kilometre off here,\" says British wind kite surfer Graham Price, clutching his wetsuit and pointing to the orange drumlines bobbing in the ocean. \"They've got dead fish on the end of them. If they're culling sharks they're attracting other sharks.\" \"It's just luring more in,\" agrees 27-year-old local, Jedda Greenwood. Other opponents point out that despite the apparent recent spike in the number of deaths from sharks, the chance of being attacked by a shark remains extremely low. Last year Australia saw 10 attacks, two of which were fatal. This year has already seen two suspected fatal attacks, including one last week in New South Wales.  On average, however, there has been just one death a year over the last half century, according to  . Statistically, a person has more chance of dying from a vending machine accident. The numbers who die from drowning are many times higher. But unfortunately for the sharks, they trigger a potent mixture of fear and fascination. \"We're not just afraid of predators,\" writes the biologist EO Wilson. \"We're transfixed by them, prone to weave stories and fables and chatter endlessly about them, because fascination creates preparedness, and preparedness, survival. In a deeply tribal sense, we love our monsters.\" For the WA policy to go ahead the federal government had to grant an exemption from the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which imposes an obligation to protect great white sharks - a vulnerable species which reach sexual maturity at just over 3m (the same length at which they are liable to be shot).  By studying shark brains and shark senses, the team is developing and testing various non-lethal repellents. The aim is to manipulate the sharks' finely-tuned senses in ways that discourage them from approaching and attacking people. Nicholas Ray of the UK's Nottingham Trent university fears that breeding populations of all three shark species on the hit list will be reduced. The fate of the grey nurse shark on Australia's east coast illustrates the potential problem - a bloody spate of shark hunting in the 1970s led to it becoming critically endangered, its fierce appearance apparently contributing to its undeserved reputation for being a \"maneater\". And while Western Australia spends millions of dollars on its catch-and-kill programme, scientists are now working on shoestring budgets to restore the grey nurse population. Rob Jones, the vet at the Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium, last month celebrated the birth of the world's first ever shark to be born via a live semen sample transported from one facility to another.  The cull, he says, is \"directly opposite\" to his research on methods to assist grey nurse reproduction and, in his view, is \"completely ludicrous\". The current cull is due to come to an end on 30 April, but on Tuesday Western Australia applied to the federal government to continue it for three more years in the summer months (November to April). Frankcom, who regained full use of her legs, says the state's politicians are \"petrified that Western Australian has become the shark capital of the world\". But she says Australians never expected the ocean to be 100% safe. \"The surfers, the people that go out everyday - they accept the risk,\" she says. \"There are lots of things in the ocean that are capable of harming us.\"  ",

        "article": "France is allowing wolf hunts in places where sheep are at risk from the carnivore's growing numbers, the BBC's John Laurenson reports. But efforts to cull wolves are controversial.  Late at night, up in an Alpine forest, a woman in a black skirt carrying a black gun gets out of her car.  Caroline Bourda is a sheep farmer, in the hamlet of Esparron la Batie. Tonight, like most nights, she is trying to show the wolf who is top predator. She fires. But up into the sky.  The government advises farmers to shoot near their farms to educate the wolves to stay away.  It has also advised - and paid for - sheep farmers to buy electric fences and huge protection dogs with spiked metal collars to stop the wolves sinking their fangs into their necks.  The French government is spending 12m euros (\u00a310m) a year on wolf attack prevention and compensation.  In some areas the government pays out more for the wolf than it does for the unemployed, according to the hill farmers' organisation Eleveurs et Montagnes (Breeders and mountains). Now France has allowed wolf hunts around threatened sheep farms like Caroline's and ordered a cull of 24 animals.  Hunters have so far managed to kill just seven, while the wolves - there are now more than 250 in France - are killing more sheep than ever. Caroline says her last wolf attack was the previous weekend. She has lost dozens of ewes. The wolf is a formidable adversary for man, she says: clever, determined and slightly unhinged. \"When they attack a flock - especially when they get inside an enclosure - they don't stop killing as long as there's still a sheep or a lamb moving,\" says Caroline.  They eat one and kill the others just for the sake of it, she says.  After being eradicated in the 1930s, the wolf padded back into France, over the Alps from Italy, in the mid-1990s, having been listed as a protected species by the  that France has signed up to. Ecologists rejoiced, Caroline among them.  She first came to this farm as an \"eco-volunteer\" with the pro-predator organisation Ferus, which aims to protect bears, wolves and lynxes. As a 20-year-old ecologist activist, studying biology at Bordeaux University, she believed that, if farmers protected their flocks properly, they and the wolf could live side-by-side.   She does not believe this anymore.  \"The wolves find a way around every protection we put in place,\" she says, pointing to the electric fences she has put up. Caroline married the sheep farmer she had come here to help.  As for Ferus, she was quickly disillusioned, she says. What they really want, she says, is for the farmers to leave so they can \"re-wild\" the mountains. It's a bit like asking what is the point of an eagle, or a piece of music, or a painting. The wolf is part of life\u201d Patrick Boffy, head of Ferus in the southern Alps, denies this.  There are some terrains - steep, rocky slopes for example - that are difficult to defend against the wolf, he says.  Here perhaps the farmers should leave, but in most places cohabitation is possible if the farmers adapt, he adds.  But why should people make these efforts for the wolf? \"It's a bit like asking what is the point of an eagle, or a piece of music, or a painting. The wolf is part of life,\" he says.  \"It returned naturally to France - the only southern European country where it had disappeared.  \"In all the others - from Spain to Turkey - there have always been wolves and not one of these countries envisaged eradicating it. The difficulty is one of mentality. In France, we need to learn, little by little, how to live alongside wild animals again.\" And not just hill farmers. The animal is moving closer to major towns.  There are now wolves among the vineyards of the Champagne region. There are wolves 160km (100 miles) east of Paris. The French may also have to re-learn the realities of living close to wild animals again. According to the historian Jean-Marc Moriceau, wolves killed 2,000 people in France between 1362 and 1918 - mainly five- to 15-year-olds.  We have simply forgotten that wolves don't only prey on people in fairy tales. ",

        "article": "The puzzling - and thus far indecipherable - nature of an old manuscript has confounded some of the world's greatest cryptologists. Is there truly a code to break, or is it all an elaborate hoax? I have come to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, at Yale University, to solve a mystery that makes The Da Vinci Code seem tame - a book no-one can read, in a language that doesn't exist, illustrated with plants and creatures that have never been seen on Earth. It is known as The Voynich Manuscript, after the second-hand book dealer, Wilfrid Voynich, who claimed to have discovered it in Italy, in 1912. Since then, it has obsessed countless experts and generated numerous theories, both scientific and crackpot. \"My favourite is that it is the illustrated diary of a teenage space alien who left it behind on earth,\" jokes the Beinecke's curator, Ray Clemens.   What surprises me is how small it is. I had expected an album-sized manuscript. But the book resting on a reading stand in front of me is about the size of a Penguin Classics edition. Bound in a limp vellum cover the colour of old ivory, it contains 240 richly illustrated pages. The illustrations look like something Timothy Leary might have seen on LSD. Strange plants, astrological symbols, jellyfish-like creatures and what looks like a lobster. In one image, a group of naked ladies with alabaster skin shoot down what looks like a water slide. The text, written in brown, iron gall ink, reminds me of Tolkien's Elvish. Some facts. Voynich was an ethnic Pole from Lithuania, in what was then the Russian Empire. Born in 1865, he was briefly imprisoned in Siberia for revolutionary activities before fleeing via Manchuria to London.  In London, he set up a second-hand bookstore, which became a centre for political exiles. Among them were Karl Marx and a Russian emigre, who adopted the moniker Sidney Reilly and became known to posterity as \"The Ace of Spies\". Voynich claimed to have stumbled on the manuscript at a Jesuit seminary outside Rome, The Villa Madragone. Appended to the manuscript was what purported to be a letter written in 1665 by Johannes Marcus Marci, a former physician of the Holy Roman Emperor.  It stated that the manuscript had once belonged to Rudolf - and was probably the work of Elizabethan alchemist Roger Bacon. Two other possible authors are regularly in the frame: John Dee, magus extraordinaire and astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I, and Dee's fellow alchemist, Edward Kelley. Voynich himself referred to it as \"The Roger Bacon Cipher Manuscript\". Since then, it has been a Venus flytrap for brilliant minds. American William Friedman, one of the greatest cryptographers of the 20th Century, who created an institution recently made famous by Edward Snowden, the NSA, spent 30 years trying to crack the manuscript's code. New theories breed like mayflies. A retired American botanist recently claimed that some of the plants are of Meso-American origin. A British applied linguist  . So what is it? A cipher for buried treasure? A poisoner's handbook? The coded recipe for eternal youth? Spoiler alert: I believe the manuscript is a forgery by Wilfrid Voynich himself. One of the most common tropes in the history of forgery is that of a rare book dealer \"discovering\" previously unknown manuscripts. Voynich is known to have had just this \"magic\" touch. He is also said to have acquired a large supply of vellum and to have used his knowledge of chemistry gained at the University of Moscow to replicate medieval inks and pigments. Readers' tickets for his shadowy friend, Sidney Reilly, show that among the books that the \"Ace of Spies\" studied at the British Museum library was Some Observations On Ancient Inks.  I believe that having forged the manuscript, Voynich then did what numerous other forgers have done - create a second document to validate the first and give it a plausible provenance. But until forensic tests are done on the ink and pigments - so far, only the vellum has been carbon dated to the 15th Century - the riddle of this mysterious book will continue to exert a powerful magnetic pull on present and future Voynichologists. \"To its deciphering he devoted unflagging toil,\" Marci wrote of the previous owner, in the letter Voynich claimed to have found in the manuscript. \"As is apparent from attempts of his which I send you herewith, and he relinquished hope only with his life.\"  or  .

        "article": "The detection of crackly ultrasonic \"pings\" from the depths of the ocean began to suggest the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was finally reaching a conclusion. Those signals, generated by the plane's \"black box\" flight recorders, now seem to have faded and search teams have turned to an \"autonomous underwater vehicle\", Bluefin-21, in the hope it may be able to track down some sign of the aircraft's wreckage. Bluefin-21 was dropped into the water on Monday near an area of sea bed known as the Zenith Plateau, around 1,800 km north west of Perth, Australia.  Depths here range from 1,753m to 6,000m - dropping away sharply further north. The process of tracking down wreckage is likely to be slow and painstaking.  Bluefin-21 takes six times longer than a towed pinger locator - used to detect the black box signals - to cover a similar area, and the two devices cannot be used at the same time. The yellow, torpedo-shaped, sub may also have to operate at depths close to its 4,500m (14,763ft) maximum, under pressure equivalent  Bluefin-21 takes two hours to descend and then spends 16 hours scanning, travelling at its top speed of just over 8km/h.  Returning to the surface then takes a further two hours, while downloading the massive volume of data recorded will fill a further 16 hours. The data will then allow search crews to construct a detailed 3D sonar map of the sea bed. If any wreckage is spotted, the sub can also be fitted with a camera to take photographs. The initial search area - roughly in the region where \"pings\" were detected by Australia's naval support ship Ocean Shield on 6 April  - covers some 40 sq km (15 sq miles).  The BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos points out that the topography of the ocean floor in the region is  , making the operation extremely challenging.  Oceanographer Peter Burkill from Plymouth University said the detailed nature of the sea bed could also be an important factor. \"If its rocky, then it's a question of what the micro-topography is like - is it flat, is it rocky, are there lots of surface crenations [scalloped-edged formations]?\" The ocean floor in the search zone had not been extensively surveyed, Professor Burkill said, mainly due to an absence of commercial interest in the remote region.  Current maps of the area's sea bed are mostly based on satellite surveys, and more detailed models are being assembled by the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).  \"Satellites are continuously monitoring the ocean, the principal ones for this investigation are European and US sea-level measuring satellites,\" said the organisation's oceanographer David Griffin. \"We're also using thermal imagery of the ocean to see the details of what the flow (current) has been.\" He explained that if the location of the detected signals had correctly identified the crash site, multi-directional ocean currents could explain why no wreckage has yet been found.  \"It's right at a position where the current is flowing in one direction just south of that position, and in the other direction just north of that,\" he said. If debris is lying in depths beyond the range of Bluefin-21, search teams will turn to more specialised equipment. This could include Remus and Remora-type unmanned mini-subs, used in the  in 2011, which can operate at depths of up to 6,000 metres. ",

Controllers confirm the spacecraft conducted a major orbit manoeuvre on Wednesday without incident. The near-eight-hour thruster burn was designed to slow the satellite's speed relative to Comet 67P/C-G. More adjustments are required, but the operation was a significant event in ensuring Rosetta meets its target. The pair are roughly 500 million km from Earth and separated by about a million km, and closing.  Wednesday's big burn was intended to take out a big chunk (almost 300m/s) of the velocity Rosetta had (755m/s) with respect to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Engineers at the European Space Agency's (Esa) \"mission control\" in Darmstadt, Germany, will have to examine in detail the telemetry it received from the satellite but confirmed on Thursday that the manoeuvre was \"completed nominally\". Paolo Ferri, who heads up operations at the Darmstadt centre, described Rosetta as having \"very stable performance\". \"Team very happy,\" reported the centre's  . Comet 67P/C-G is travelling around the Sun on a big loop that takes it out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and then back in to just inside the orbit of Mars.   Rosetta is attempting to target its rendezvous at the start of the inward curve, before our star can warm the 4km-wide body and trigger large jets of gas and dust from its surface.  The mission goal is to orbit the comet, starting on 6 August, and then follow the body in its orbit. In November, an attempt will be made to put a small lander, called Philae, on 67P's surface.

The players named in the suit say they were given narcotics and other drugs without a prescription, and had health issues and addictions as a result.  A NFL spokesman said their lawyers had not yet reviewed the lawsuit. The league previously settled a case that accused it of concealing it knew the risks of multiple concussions. It settled that lawsuit for $765m (\u00a3454m), without admitting wrongdoing. In a complaint filed on Tuesday in a US court, lawyers for the eight named players said the NFL had \"intentionally, recklessly and negligently created and maintained a culture of drug misuse, substituting players' health for profit\". The retired players include three members of the NFL champions 1985 Chicago Bears - Richard Dent, Keith Van Horne and Jim McMahon.  The suit seeks class-action status, and says more than 500 other former NFL players have signed up. In addition to unspecified financial damages, the players are seeking to require the NFL to create a testing and monitoring programme to help prevent addiction and health issues from the use of painkillers. \"The NFL knew of the debilitating effects of these drugs on all of its players and callously ignored the players' long-term health in its obsession to return them to play,\" Steven Silverman, a lawyer for the players said in a statement. Mr McMahon alleges said he suffered a broken neck and ankle during his time in the NFL, but was never told about those injuries by team doctors. Instead he received medications and returned to play. The complaint also alleges Mr Van Horne played an entire season on a broken leg, and was not told about the injury for five years \"during which time he was fed a constant diet of pills to deal with the pain\". And former player JD Hill allegedly \"received hundreds, if not thousands, of pills from trainers and doctors, including but not limited to NSAIDs [anti-inflammatory drugs], codeine, Valium and Librium\", without a prescription or warning of potential side effects. Mr Hill said he left the NFL - after a career in the 1970s - addicted to painkillers, and became homeless as a result.  In a statement to the Associated Press news agency, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said: \"We have not seen the lawsuit, and our attorneys have not had an opportunity to review it.\" ",

You'll have to hurry down to Pitcairn Island as there are only six plants left.   The common thread linking these endangered species is that they are residents of UK Overseas Territories. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has reported that 94% of unique British species live outside the UK - and some urgently need protection. The RSPB report concerns 14 territories - relics of empire scattered from the South Pacific to the Mediterranean.  Prime Minister David Cameron has said that the Overseas Territories provide, \"an important opportunity to set world standards in our stewardship of the extraordinary natural environments we have inherited\".   With the report showing that 85% of our critically endangered species live in these territories, the RSPB is asking for increased spending to meet the Prime Minister's ambitions.   The Turks and Caicos Islands, 250km (150 miles) to the east of Cuba, are home to unique species such as the Barking Gecko, the Turks and Caicos Rock Iguana and the Pygmy Boa Constrictor.   But there is no statutory protection for native creatures there, and intense pressure on their habitat as the tourist industry expands. There are plans for a dolphinarium on the island of Grand Turk and proposals to build a freight shipping port, marina and cruise ship terminal on East Caicos.  It's one of the largest uninhabited islands in the Caribbean with some of the region's best preserved coral reefs and turtle nesting beaches.   The head of the islands' Department of Environment and Maritime Affairs, Kathleen Wood, fears that \"this kind of project cannot be done sensitively. You would have to dredge through an incredible amount of reef\". Turks and Caicos premier Rufus Ewing is more enthusiastic, accepting that some of the pristine environment will be damaged.  He told BBC Radio Four's   programme: \"There are some things that sometimes we may have to sacrifice.  It is an area we can use to boost our economy, to boost our development. \" Other risks to the species of Turks and Caicos come from further afield. Endangered Queen Conch and Spiny Lobster are taken by scuba-diving poachers whilst the scrub forests are being ravaged by fires burnt by illegal immigrants from Haiti. Mature trees are felled and burnt to make charcoal for their cooking stoves. Should Britain be doing more to protect the environment of Turks and Caicos and the other territories, as the RSPB is demanding?  Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds says that the UK funds specific conservation projects and helps train local staff - but, ultimately, \"it is the responsibility of the territory governments to deliver environment protection and the maintenance of their bio-diversity\".  But back in Turks and Caicos, Ethlyn Gibbs-Williams of the local National Trust would like the UK to flex its muscles. The local emphasis on economic development needs to be tempered, she says: \"We would like to see more support from the British government ensuring that we have strong environmental laws\".  reports from the Turks and Caicos Islands on BBC Radio Four at 3.30pm on Tuesday 20th May.

Researchers found that the hard working sheep dogs were successful at keeping seagulls away from beaches. Gull dropping are known to be a source of E. coli bacteria, which can lead to abdominal cramping and diarrhoea in humans.   High levels of the bug are a leading cause of beach closures in many parts of the world, including the UK. The bacteria are commonly found in human and animal faeces and can end up in the seas through rain water run off or from sewage. Seagulls have been implicated in the   of the bug. A recent report showed that around a third of E. coli samples taken from the birds were resistant to more than one antibiotic.  In this new study, researchers assigned the dogs to 200-metre stretches of beach along the shores of Lake Michigan in the US, which were patrolled for parts of the summer season. Half way through the dogs were switched to untreated sections. Populations of Ring-Billed gulls have soared in the region since the 1970s with numbers increasing by 10% per year. The collies, known for their intelligence and their herding abilities, disturbed the seagulls and kept them from landing on the beaches. \"Most of the time, the dogs were kept on their leads,\" said Dr Elizabeth Alm from Central Michigan University, who led the study. \"They were released with the leads dropped, only when their handler directed them to chase gulls. Then the dogs were called, they would circle back, and the handler would pick the lead back up.\" Over the course of the summers of 2012 and 2013, the scientists recorded the number of birds at each section of beach while water and sand samples were collected and tested for E. coli.  They found that the bacterial counts were significantly lower on those sandy stretches where the dogs had kept the gulls at bay. However the benefit didn't last through the whole season and the researchers found that later in the summer, bacterial numbers had risen once again. Dr Alm believes that the timing of the dog patrols is crucial to their effectiveness. \"If the E. coli establish in the sand early in the season, they appear to be able to persist, and probably even grow in the sand so that even though the dogs can remove the gulls from the beach later in the season, this late reduction in gulls does not translate in to a late season reduction in E. coli.\"  One key question though was the worry that the dogs themselves might increase the levels of E. coli if they had to answer nature's call while working on the beach. \"These were professional working dogs,\" said Dr Alm. \"They were given ample opportunity to take care of their \"business\" before going to work. They didn't often poop on the beach, but if they did it was immediately picked up by their handler and disposed of off the beach.\" The research has been published at the   of the American Society for Microbiology.

        "article": "A perfectly preserved baby mammoth which died 42,000 years ago has been unveiled at the Natural History Museum in London. Named Lyuba by the Siberian deer herder who discovered her in 2007, the specimen is 130cm tall and weighs 50kg. Palaeontologist Prof Adrian Lister described seeing her for the first time as an \"incredible experience\". Transported in a box that was opened on Monday, the juvenile female mammoth looked almost intact.  Prof Lister pointed out the small milk tusks that are barely visible, the almost flattened shape of the trunk designed to drink water from snow and a small layer of fat on top of the head which would have kept her warm in the permafrost of north-west Siberia.  Lyuba was found to have clay in her trunk, leading scientists to believe she suffocated on it while getting water. She is believed to have been discovered after her snowy grave thawed out during the spring and her remains washed up on a river bank. The animal looked more like her distant elephant family relatives with wrinkled, leathery skin, as the hair which would have covered her warmly in life had eroded away, leaving just a few tufts. Her only defect was the tail which has been gnawed off by animals. Her body looks slightly deflated, which Prof Lister explains is from her effectively being mummified under the weight of all that ice for so long. Traces of the blue, powdery mineral vivianite, which is commonly found on fossils, can be seen on her body. Professor Lister said: \"To see a three-dimensional mammoth in the flesh is absolutely extraordinary. \"To be eyeball to eyeball with a creature from the Ice Age which is so perfectly preserved and lifelike, looking like she is lying down and might walk away at any minute, is really moving. I have to pinch myself to think she died 42,000 years ago. \"It's wonderful to be able to share this with the public at the museum when she's never been outside of Russia and Asia before. It's really exciting and I'm sure others will be moved by seeing her.\" Lyuba was named after the deer herder Yuri Khudi's wife (the name also means love in Russian). She was discovered by the Yuribei River, in the Yamal-Nenets district. Even her internal organs are intact.  Scientists regard the specimen as the most fully preserved mammoth ever found. Mammoths first appeared in the Pliocene Epoch, some 4.8 million years ago. Climate change, overkill by human hunters, or a combination of both are among the explanations for their eventual disappearance about 5,000 years ago. Lyuba, normally on display at the Yamal-Nenets Regional Museum-Exhibition Complex, will be on show at the Natural History Museum from Friday 23 May until 7 September.  ",

Zubair Mufti of the World Health Organization tells the BBC's Kim Ghattas the US move \"is coming at the right time\" The CIA has ended the use of vaccine programmes in its spying operations amid concerns for the safety of health workers, the White House has said. In a  , a White House aide said the CIA stopped such practices in August. The CIA used a fake vaccine programme to try to find Osama Bin Laden before US special forces killed him in 2011. The CIA's move comes after a wave of deadly attacks by militants on polio vaccination workers in Pakistan.  \"By publicising this policy, our objective is to dispel one canard that militant groups have used as justification for cowardly attacks against vaccination providers,\" CIA spokesman Dean Boyd said in a statement to the BBC. Sixty-six cases of polio have been declared in Pakistan since January, compared with only eight during the same period last year.  And more than 60 polio workers and security personnel were killed between December 2012 and April 2014, most of them in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to Pakistani officials and humanitarian workers.  The geographical spread of the cases suggests they are mostly sourced to the north-western Waziristan tribal region, the BBC's Ilyas Khan reports from Islamabad. Militants controlling the region banned vaccination there, saying health workers may include American spies.  \"This reassurance is coming at the right time and we sincerely hope this will contribute towards reaching the children,\" Zubair Mufti of the World Health Organization told the BBC. \"Public health programmes should only be focused toward providing health to the people and not collateral things.\" In a letter dated 16 May, the White House assistant to the president for homeland security and counter-terrorism, Lisa Monaco, wrote that CIA director John Brennan had directed the agency to cease \"operational use of vaccine programmes\". \"Similarly, the agency will not seek to obtain or exploit DNA or other genetic material acquired through such programmes,\" she wrote, adding the policy applied worldwide to US and non-US persons alike. Genetic material obtained through a fake door-to-door hepatitis B vaccination programme reportedly helped the CIA confirm Bin Laden's whereabouts in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad. The al-Qaeda leader was killed in a May 2011 raid by US special forces. The Pakistani doctor accused of running the vaccination campaign remains in jail.  Dr Shakil Afridi was convicted of ties to militant groups, which he denies, and imprisoned in 2012. The move is widely seen as punishment for his helping the CIA.  Correspondents say he is regarded as a traitor by Pakistan's security agencies. Mr Boyd, the CIA spokesman, said \"many obstacles\" stand in the way of vaccination programmes, including myths they cause use sterility or HIV and claims they are spy programmes run by Western governments. \"While the CIA can do little about the former, the [CIA] director felt he could do something important to dispel the latter and he acted,\" Mr Boyd said. \"It is important to note that militant groups have a long history of attacking humanitarian aid workers in Pakistan and those attacks began years before the raid against the Bin Laden compound and years before any press reports claiming a CIA-sponsored vaccination programme.\" ",

Fossilised bones of a dinosaur believed to be the largest creature ever to walk the Earth have been unearthed in Argentina, palaeontologists say. Based on its huge thigh bones, it was 40m (130ft) long and 20m (65ft) tall. Weighing in at 77 tonnes, it was as heavy as 14 African elephants, and seven tonnes heavier than the previous record holder,  . Scientists believe it is a new species of titanosaur - an enormous herbivore dating from the Late Cretaceous period. A local farm worker first stumbled on the remains in the desert near La Flecha, about 250km (135 miles) west of Trelew, Patagonia.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Dr Diego Pol explains how the weight of the dinosaur was calculated The fossils were then excavated by a team of palaeontologists from the Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio, led by Dr Jose Luis Carballido and Dr Diego Pol. They unearthed the partial skeletons of seven individuals - about 150 bones in total - all in \"remarkable condition\". A film crew from the BBC Natural History Unit was there to capture the moment the scientists realised exactly how big their discovery was. By measuring the length and circumference of the largest femur (thigh bone), they calculated the animal weighed 77 tonnes. \"Given the size of these bones, which surpass any of the previously known giant animals, the new dinosaur is the largest animal known that walked on Earth,\" the researchers told BBC News. \"Its length, from its head to the tip of its tail, was 40m. \"Standing with its neck up, it was about 20m high - equal to a seven-storey building.\" This giant herbivore lived in the forests of Patagonia between 95 and 100 million years ago, based on the age of the rocks in which its bones were found. But despite its magnitude, it does not yet have a name. \"It will be named describing its magnificence and in honour to both the region and the farm owners who alerted us about the discovery,\" the researchers said. There have been many previous contenders for the title \"world's biggest dinosaur\". The most recent pretender to the throne was  , a similar type of sauropod, also discovered in Patagonia. Originally thought to weigh in at 100 tonnes, it was later revised down to about 70 tonnes - just under the 77 tonnes that this new sauropod is thought to have weighed. The picture is muddied by the various complicated methods for estimating size and weight, based on skeletons that are usually incomplete.  was estimated from only a few bones. But the researchers here had dozens to work with, making them more confident that they really have found \"the big one\". Dr Paul Barrett, a dinosaur expert from London's Natural History Museum, agreed the new species is \"a genuinely big critter. But there are a number of similarly sized big sauropod thigh bones out there,\" he cautioned. \"Without knowing more about this current find it's difficult to be sure. One problem with assessing the weight of both   and this new discovery is that they're both based on very fragmentary specimens - no complete skeleton is known, which means the animal's proportions and overall shape are conjectural. \"Moreover, several different methods exist for calculating dinosaur weight (some based on overall volume, some on various limb bone measurements) and these don't always agree with each other, with large measures of uncertainty. \"So it's interesting to hear another really huge sauropod has been discovered, but ideally we'd need much more material of these supersized animals to determine just how big they really got.\" ",

        "article": "The ancient remains of a teenage girl discovered deep underground in Mexico are providing additional insights on how the Americas came to be populated. Divers found the juvenile's bones by chance in a vast, flooded limestone chamber on the Yucatan Peninsula. Aged 15 or 16 at death, the girl lived at least 12,000 years ago.  Researchers have told Science Magazine her DNA backs the idea that the first Americans and modern Native American Indians share a common ancestry. This theory argues that people from Siberia settled on the land bridge dubbed Beringia that linked Asia and the Americas some 20,000 years ago before sea levels rose. These people then moved south to populate the American continents. The genetics of modern Native Americans would certainly appear to link them into this story. But their facial features set them apart from the oldest skeletons now being unearthed. These ancient people had narrower, longer skulls. The differences have hinted that perhaps there were multiple immigrations from Siberia (or even Europe).       However, the remains of the Yucatan girl, dubbed Naia - which means \"water nymph\" in Greek - does not follow that line of thinking, because although she had the slender features associated with the earliest Americans, her DNA shares commonalities with modern Native Americans. It appears she fell quite a distance and struck something hard\u201d Lab analysis of teeth and bone samples link her to a particular genetic lineage known as Haplogroup D1.   This same marker is found in substantial numbers of modern Native Americans. \"This lineage is thought to have developed in Beringia, the land that now lies beneath the Bering Sea after its ice age occupants became genetically isolated from the rest of Asia,\" explained lead author Dr Jim Chatters.  \"Thus, Naia, one of the earliest occupants of the Americas yet found, suggests that Paleoamericans do not represent an early migration from a part of the world different than that of the Native Americans.  \"Rather, Paleoamericans and Native Americans descended from the same homeland in Beringia.  \"The differences between them likely arose from evolution that occurred after the Beringian gene pool became separated from the rest of the world.\" The Yucatan Peninsula is famous for its giant limestone sinkholes, or cenotes.  The chamber where the girl was found represents one of these pits before its roof has collapsed to produce a wide surface opening. To reach the natural amphitheatre, divers had to swim almost 1km (0.6 miles) through a water-filled tunnel. \"The moment we entered inside, we knew it was an incredible place,\" recalled Alberto Nava.  \"The floor disappeared under us and we could not see across to the other side. We pointed our lights down and to the side; all we could see was darkness.  \"We felt as if our powerful underwater lights were being destroyed by this void. So we called it 'black hole', which in Spanish is 'Hoyo Negro'.\" Scientists can only speculate as to why Naia had been in the cavern. Skeletal remains of many animals also litter the pit's floor. The suspicion is that they all were looking for water, because the region had a very dry climate 12,000 years ago and the cavern would have been mostly dry but for a few pools. Perhaps they stumbled and fell to their death in the darkness.   \"Her pelvis is broken and it appears to have been broken at or around the time of her death because it's fractured in a way that relatively young bone would break rather than ancient bone,\" said Dr Chatters. \"So, it appears she fell quite a distance and struck something hard. I think she died almost instantly, if not instantly.\"   On the face of it, the new study supports research published in February that looked at the genetics of an infant who died at about the same time in what is now the US State of Montana. This investigation of \"Anzick\" boy, as he has become known, was conducted on the main DNA material found in the nuclei of the cells.  Naia's DNA, on the other hand, was sourced from outside the nuclei of her cells - in structures called the mitochondria. These carry much more limited information.   Dr Shane Doyle from Montana State University said Dr Chatters' team therefore still had some ground to travel before very robust conclusions could be drawn. \"In my view they have a way to go before they can say anything substantial,\" he told BBC News.  \"It's extremely difficult to get at the nuclear DNA and decoding it is very complex, but this is what they need to do. Until they do that, they cannot tell us a lot about where Native American Indians came from.\"    Dr Chatters confirmed that unravelling Naia's nuclear genome was a future priority.  and follow me on Twitter:  ",

That's the most important question\u201d Now these precious fossils are going under the glare of a giant X-ray machine - to find out what lies buried beneath the surface.

For the first time, they can see the complete skeleton in 3D. Not just the surface outlines, but all the hidden bones and feathers too. They hope to discover how \"the first true birds\" evolved from feathered dinosaurs and took flight. And what's more, to answer a riddle that has puzzled palaeontologists for 150 years. Could  fly, or not? The new tests are taking place at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, at the foot of the French Alps. It's a beam that's only the thickness of a human hair. But extremely powerful\u201d In the past, large fossil slabs were too bulky to be scanned in a synchrotron light source - a type of particle accelerator which generates high-energy X-rays. But now scientists here are experimenting with a clever new trick, inspired by a very ancient and simple idea - the pinhole camera. The basic concept has been around since at least 400 BC. But it was Leonardo da Vinci who made the first detailed drawings of a camera obscura in his 1485 sketchbook, Codex Atlanticus. Light entering through a tiny hole is magnified and projected onto a screen wall. Leonardo's camera allowed artists inside a tent to accurately trace and paint panoramic landscapes. In a synchrotron, the pinhole system allows large fossils - too bulky to be rotated and scanned via conventional techniques (such as tomography) - to be captured in full by an extremely narrow X-ray beam. \"It's a beam that's only the thickness of a human hair. But extremely powerful. If you stood in front of it you would be killed,\" says Dr Paul Tafforeau, a palaeontologist at ESRF. \"As the beam goes through the sample you have diffusion of the X-rays and this diffusion pattern can be detected via the camera obscura - a very small hole in a piece of lead.

The world's biggest, most famous dinosaur skeletons could be seen in a whole new light. What is really remarkable are the feathers - they are far more visible by this new scan\u201d And so to demonstrate their proof of principle, the ESRF team began by summoning a very famous specimen.  caused a major stir when the first fossil was unearthed in 1861 - just two years after Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species. With the claws and teeth of a dinosaur, but the feathers of a bird, it was immediately recognised as a transitional form - proof of Darwin's theory. Hailed as \"the first true bird\", the discovery shook the scientific community. Not bad for an animal as small as a magpie - only 20 inches from head to tail. In recent years, more primitive bird ancestors have been unearthed in Liaoning, China. But the fascination with   has endured - driven by the unsolved mystery over its ability to fly. Around 150 million years ago, the modern-day region of Germany where  lived was an archipelago of islands in a shallow tropical sea, covered in lush vegetation. \"We want to know how   lived,\" says Martin Roeper, curator of the Solnhofen Museum, which houses one of the specimens. \"Was he a little dinosaur running, climbing trees - or was he flying? That's the most important question. Could   fly or not?\" Now that we see the whole wings - now everyone can see this really is a very fine specimen\u201d The answer grows closer as new, microscopic details of its anatomy emerge from ever more precise scans. Blood vessels within the bones, for example, can be compared to modern birds.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Full scan of 'first bird' fossil One by one, the 12 fossils have been arriving at the ESRF. And very soon there may be a major breakthrough to announce. In the meantime: \"What is really remarkable are the feathers - they are far more visible by this new scan than by looking at the original specimen,\" says Paul Tafforeau. \"But that's not all, because this technique reveals a lot about the anatomy that's not visible below the surface. \"You can see many hidden details inside the stone. With these we can better understand what  really was.\" If this X-ray spectacle can be repeated with other famous fossils, there may be other discoveries that ruffle the feathers of established wisdom. And not only scientists will see the benefit, says Martin Roeper. \"In former times the visitors to our museum cannot easily understand the fossil - because they cannot see the feathers. \"But now that we see the whole wings - now everyone can see that   really is a very fine specimen.\" ",

WATCH: See the KickSat project's journey into the Earth's lower orbit Exploring space has long been the sole diversion of governments, big business and academics. With each galactic jaunt potentially costing hundreds of millions of pounds and demanding decades of planning, it's hardly a surprise that we're not all reaching for the nearest astrophysics textbook. As of this week, however, 104 regular Earth citizens can now claim to each have had their own satellite in orbit, each for less than \u00a3200 ($300). The age of personal space exploration has begun.  The space pioneers are all backers of the KickSat project.  Started in December 2011 on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter, the project attracted more than double its initial asking amount, pulling in nearly $75,000.  Three years later, KickSat's 104 satellites have hitched a lift into orbit aboard SpaceX's CRS-3 resupply rocket to the International Space Station. The big idea behind KickSat is to make satellites so tiny that the cost of getting into space can be split hundreds or even thousands of ways.  The major expense of space flight, perhaps unsurprisingly, is getting off the Earth - typically it costs up to $100,000/kg to ride a rocket into space. The KickSat satellites, called Sprites, are drastically different to the large and costly satellites currently orbiting above our heads.  Weighing 5g (0.18oz) and small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, Sprites only exist thanks to the progress made in the miniaturisation of electronics. Much like the diminutive Raspberry Pi computer, plenty of computing grunt can now be packed into a comparatively small area.  The brains of the Sprites are roughly as big as a fingernail, but are about as powerful as the entire computing system on board each of the Voyager space probes launched in the late 1970s. Combine this with cheap off-cuts from space quality solar panels, a few other small instruments and memory wire antennae, and you have a tiny satellite capable of transmitting data back to Earth. Standard Sprites only collect a relatively limited amount of data - such as temperature, and magnetic and orientation information - but even this, when collected in large numbers, can be useful. \"One instrument by itself might not be very high quality but in aggregate, by the hundred or by the thousand, you can take measurements that you can't necessarily get in any other way,\" Michael Johnson, co-creator of the KickSat project, tells BBC Click. \"For example, instead of having to land a large rover on a planet you might instead land a few thousand very small spacecraft all around the surface. \"As they get blown around by weather systems they will go to places that a rover couldn't even get to.\" Just like a Raspberry Pi, the programming of the Sprites can also be customised to perform new and novel tasks.  Luke Bussell, a sixth-former from York, heard about the KickSat project whilst studying for his astronomy GCSE and ended up programming his own Sprite.  By watching for unexpected changes in the Sprite's memory, he was able to turn the satellite into a cosmic ray damage detector. Prof Alan Woodwood, from the department of computing at the University of Surrey, welcomes the idea of schoolchildren like Luke being able to achieve such scientific dreams. But he remains concerned about the prospect of increased access to space.  \"It's getting very crowded up there, and it's a bit of a Wild West,\" he says. \"There is a responsibility that not too much goes up by the people putting things up there.  \"There's always a risk that they could damage a communications or weather satellite. If care isn't taken, problems of debris and space junk could become a lot worse.\"  Mr Johnson says he has taken this into account by designing a limited lifespan into the Sprite satellites. Within a few weeks of launch all of them should re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up.  However, if citizen space exploration does become more common, it could become a problem. For enthusiasts like Luke and Mr Johnson, projects like KickSat are only the beginning of an era of personal, open-source space exploration. Many of the lessons learned from the KickSat mission are being used to inform Michael's next project, PocketSpacecraft, which has even grander ambitions.  \"There are more than a million bodies in the solar system worth exploring, whether that's planets, moons, asteroids or comets, and since the beginning of the space age there's been about one Earth escape spacecraft launched every year to go out and do some exploration,\" says Mr Johnson. \"The science done is incredible, but we're never going to explore a million bodies in the solar system at a billion dollars a time, there simply isn't enough money in the world.\" Aiming to launch in 2015, the team at PocketSpacecraft are working on an even smaller satellite design, called a Scout, that they hope will travel all the way to the Moon. With an average thickness of 20 microns (0.02mm), the Scout is designed to allow thousands to be packed into a single launch, reducing the costs per satellite considerably. The design also makes use of printable electronics, and a technique called lapping - removing excess silicon from the core chip - to minimise thickness and weight as much as possible.  Even the memory metal aerial is put to good use, doubling up as as a structural support for the Scout by looping around its edge. Looking to the future, Michael says the ultra-thin Scouts may eventually be able to ride the light from the Sun to distant parts of our solar system, steering by changing their reflectivity with LCD shutters. Although PocketSpacecraft's Kickstarter campaign failed to hit its target, Mr Johnson has since managed to attract the $500,000 needed to fund the mission. He acknowledges, however, that there is no guarantee of success. \"One of the things we're very clear about is this is hugely risky,\" he says. \"If you're doing billion-dollar missions roughly 50% of them fail\u2026 so failure is an option. \"We try to have as many alternative ways as possible of getting data back from these spacecraft, so that at whatever point we get to, we'll get some useful return from the mission.\" ",

        "article": "Pearl dealers are turning to cutting edge science to help them distinguish between cultured pearls and the natural kind. Natural pearls continue to fetch high prices, but methods for culturing them have become so sophisticated that it is increasingly difficult to tell between them. As Ali Safar takes a pearl out of the X-ray machine, he looks carefully at it before passing the large luminescent bead to an analyst who scrutinises it through a microscope. The Directorate of Precious Metals and Gemstone Testing in Bahrain can produce crystal clear images but as Ali Safar says, detecting a cultured pearl is not straightforward.  \"Today we see cultured pearls that have virtually the same structure as a natural pearl,\" he explains. \"The means of producing cultured pearls have become ever more sophisticated so as to mimic the real thing.\"  Whereas in the past Bahraini pearl merchants such as the Al Mahmouds would have been able to spot a natural pearl just by looking at it, today's market is more complex.  Making the distinction is important in Bahrain, where it is forbidden to trade in cultured pearls.  But it is also a distinction that is challenging the Swiss Gemmological Institute (SSEF) and in particular its director Michael Krzemnicki who is called on by the major auction houses to provide certificates stating whether a pearl is natural or cultured along with additional information about shape, size, colour and hue.  At the institute's laboratory headquarters in Basel all pearls undergo three weeks of increasing complex examination, inspected by a team of half a dozen experts using specially designed equipment to delve ever more deeply into the formation mechanism of each pearl that arrives. \"The history of a piece of jewellery has always been of considerable interest,\" Michael Krzemnicki says.  \"In the case of pearls there are numerous elements that are significant when it comes to provenance. Technology is able to identify definitively the type of shell from which a natural pearl originates, whether a fresh water mollusc or a salt water wild oyster. But our latest testing methodology can reveal a lot more.\"  Using methods such as UV-visible photo-spectrometry and micro-Raman spectroscopy, some of the more straightforward of the stringent tests now being applied to the dozens of strands of pearls, sets of earrings, bracelets, broaches and rings arriving at the institute each week. This provides sufficient information to satisfy most clients.  Laurent Cartier, a project manager at the SSEF, says: \"We can see whether a pearl has a nucleus indicating that a human-induced, artificial irritant introduced into the shell to stimulate the growth of a cultured pearl.\"  But he points our that even a battery of enhanced visual examinations can be misled by some cultured pearls such as the Keshi.  \"The Keshi pearl has no nucleus but is nonetheless induced by human intervention,\" he explains.  \"We now have a special 3D tomography imaging machine that can enter the pearl layer-by-layer and so gets a far more distinct view.\" The institute is called on to certify old pearls that have been traded for over a hundred years and the research contributes to providing or confirming specific historical background.  By the end of next year, says Michael Krzemnicki, a more precise instrument will be in use.  \"We have developed a new approach to radiography using an instrument made in collaboration with a Swiss academic research institution. It gives us enhanced, more detailed structures through scatter effect X-ray,\" he explains. With huge differences in value, attempts to pass off cultured pearls as natural pearls are not uncommon. This has forced international auction houses, who sell directly to investors with possibly only a limited knowledge of pearls, to provide one or more authenticity certificates from independent scientific bodies.  But certification of colour, shape, size and hue is no longer enough for those who have a focus on the precise area where a pearl developed and its age.  This has has led to the development of new methods that can pinpoint the type of oyster, a geographic location and a time scale. Joana Meyer who works as a researcher for the Department of Environmental System Science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich has been able to genetically fingerprint a pearl.  \"For the first time we've been able to obtain DNA from a pearl and test it,\" she states.  \"We've developed a non-destructive technique - enlarging the already existing drill hole to obtain very fine particles - pearl powder - and then testing it.\"  Some 10mg of drilled sample powder is sufficient to identify the oyster species.  \"DNA is well preserved in pearls even if they were harvested many years earlier and stored in a safe at normal temperatures over many years,\" she adds.  This breakthrough makes it possible to identify whether a pearl originates in the Arabian Gulf or Australia. An important scientific discovery and one that also has financial implications for buyers and investors.  \"We can determine if it is a Basra pearl as they are known in the Gulf,\" says Joana. DNA testing has augmented what can be known about a pearl and its formation,  but at present this additional information is not routinely made known by the SSEF. As Michael Krzemnicki says, consideration needs to be given to the way this is presented in a report.  \"Whatever our laboratory does in terms of science we always have to think carefully how we offer this as a service to clients,\" he told BBC News.  He goes on to explain that the organisation's expertise and development of new technology will allow further identification - and that this may result in adjustments to prices for certain pearls. \"As DNA fingerprinting becomes easier, it may be possible to say that a pearl comes not only from the Arabian Gulf but from a particular place in that area,\" he explains. \"We have to consider what this will mean to the final customer.\" ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. WATCH: See some of the videos and images sent back by the budget satellites Imagine being able to monitor deforestation tree by tree - and act accordingly.  Or, as a farmer, remotely monitoring the health and yield of crops on a daily basis over huge swathes of land.   Perhaps as an aid agency, effortlessly estimating the flow of human traffic across borders over the course of a week.  And for business retail analysts, estimating the footfall of  a retail chain by counting the sheer number of vehicles in its car parking lots across a region.   These are just some of the countless possibilities conceivable when our world is observed from on-high every day or week, rather than the years it can currently take to completely update our planet's imagery on services such as Google Earth.   Soon these possibilities will translate into reality, as a new image-focused space race is steadily gathering pace.   Rather than being conducted by nation-states or mega-corps,  it is being played out by Silicon Valley tech start-ups doing what they do best - defying conventional thinking to disrupt an entire industry.  Their goal is to reveal an unprecedented understanding of activity conducted on Earth by taking and analysing pictures of our planet in its entirety.  The new building blocks of this revolution are tiny -  a fleet of shoebox-sized \"cubesats\" - cheap, miniature satellites, developed over the past decade in universities to aid space research.  From a characteristically untidy San Francisco start-up office no larger than a family home, Planet Labs' 40-strong team of 20 and 30-somethings is making the largest constellation of satellites the world has ever seen - 131 planned in the next 12 months, to give a comprehensive snapshot of Earth almost daily, with pictures sent back for analysis within hours.  \"We're basically leveraging billions of dollars that has been spent in consumer electronics to advance space exploration and the capabilities of satellites to help people on the planet,\" says British co-founder and chief executive Will Marshall.  In February the first few in its initial batch of 28 were ejected out of an airlock on the International Space Station.  These cubesats - called \"doves\" in line with their peace-harbouring ambitions - are now sending back their first images from low-Earth polar orbit,  passing over Earth at five miles a second. The pictures are detailed enough to pick out individual trees (although not individuals, addressing objections from privacy advocates) - which will give an unparalleled insight into activity on the planet's surface.  The company says its mission is ultimately to democratise access to information about our planet.  \"Instead of seeing a hole in the Amazon a few months after trees have been taken down there, we can see it as it's happening\", says the Planet Labs co-founder.   Although the company plans to give away valuable data to NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and other suitably worthy causes in line with its humanitarian aims, Planet Labs sees no contradiction in being first and foremost a profit-making concern, backed by venture capital and already attracting paying customers. A makeshift clean room separated by plastic sheeting from the main office is where off-the-shelf components from camera lenses to solar-charged batteries are assembled into the finished product sheathed in solar panels.  The entire package measures just 10cm (4in) by 10cm by 30cm.  \"Nowadays we put more capability into these little satellites than you can possibly imagine - into something just a few kilos much more capable than a satellite a few years ago that was 10 tonnes,\" says Mr Marshall.   With only basic manoeuvring capabilities and cheap sensors these cubesats clearly do not conform to the same rigour as conventional satellite-construction - but then again, the cost of a cubesat satellite failure comes is in at  thousands of dollars, not hundreds of millions.  \"If we lose a satellite, it's a bad day in the office but not a catastrophe,\" Mr Marshall says. But this revolution in satellite imaging is not confined to still pictures.  Other start-ups, such as Skybox and Canadian Urthecast, are focusing their efforts on high-definition video, with far bigger fridge-freezer-sized satellites equipped with more powerful telescopes capturing far more detail than those capable in mere cubesats.   At a resolution of just over 1m per pixel, the most powerful on-board telescopes can track single cars travelling along a road, or groups of people gathering.  Skybox's first satellite of a planned fleet of 24 launched in December.  Flying in low-Earth orbit around Earth 16 times a day, it is now relaying 90-second black-and-white clips, which, cloud-cover permitting, allow unprecedented analysis of movement on Earth.   \"If you show someone a still image of an area they can gain some understanding of what's happening,\" says Skybox founder Julian Mann. \"But if you show someone even a few seconds of video we intuitively understand more.\"  The use cases here for deep analysis are compelling - everything from natural disaster relief to supply-chain monitoring of commodities or broadcast news coverage of conflict zones.  Urthecast delivers its so-called \"ultra-HD video\" in colour - and plans to open up its platform to individual consumers to be able to observe their own backyards. There is no doubt as to the potential these systems offer.  But they also leave the door open to misuse of the technology - not for the benefit of our planet or humanity but for self-centred interests ranging from corporate espionage to greater control over rebel insurgency.  Thomas Immel has spent two decades as a scientist at the Space Science Laboratory at UC Berkeley.  \"These new capabilities open up a Pandora's box,\" he says. \"Some applications may well be harmful or controversial.  \"What is clear is that 10 years from now we'll be having another argument over the next implementation of technology that we can't even imagine.\" Some consequences may be easier to predict - like attracting the attention of bigger technology firms.  Skybox is already rumoured to be in early-stage acquisition talks with Google, which bought drone start-up Titan aerospace earlier this year, following hot on the heels of Facebook's purchase of UK-based drone maker Ascenta.  Silicon Valley's behemoths clearly have stellar ambitions of their own - and the newfound opportunities presented by Earth-observation may well prove too tempting to resist. ",

        "article": "It's one of the stars of the World Cup - the paintbrush with which the world's greatest footballing maestros must create their art. But is it up to the task? The Brazuca, the official ball of Brazil 2014, is the 12th ball created by Adidas for the World Cup.  The company came under fire four years ago for the Jabulani, the official ball at the 2010 competition in South Africa, which was heavily criticised. \"It's trajectory is unpredictable,\" claimed Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, while Brazilian striker Luis Fabiano branded it \"supernatural\". Adidas claims the Brazuca has improved touch and accuracy.  If the players are sitting there listening to me they should not kick the ball as hard now compared with 2010\u201d \"We do extensive flight path analysis and the results have shown constant and predictable paths, with deviations hardly recognisable,\" Adidas's football director Matthias Mecking told the BBC.   Experts in aerodynamics interviewed by the BBC outline three factors that are expected to influence how the official ball of Brazil 2014 will behave. \"The most important thing on the soccer ball is how much roughness you have,\" explained Dr Rabi Mehta, branch chief at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California, and an aerodynamics expert.   The amount of roughness, he explains, \"dictates what the critical speed is going to be at which you get maximum 'knuckling' of the ball\". He tested the Jabulani in a wind tunnel and has been looking at the Brazuca. The so called \"knuckling effect\" occurs when the ball does not spin or spins very little. Dr Mehta explains that when a relatively smooth ball with seams flies through the air without much spin, the air close to the surface is affected by the seams, producing an asymmetric flow. This asymmetry creates forces that can suddenly knock the ball, causing volatile swoops. But \"when the ball is spinning you get the Magnus effect that makes the ball curve\", he explains. The seams of a football disturb the flow of the air\u201d \"It's spin-induced side force. So when you see these banana kicks around the wall - for the free kicks like Bend It Like Beckham... that is exactly the Magnus effect.\" It is the knuckling effect and the smoother surface of the Jabulani, compared to the Brazuca, that explains its unpredictability, according to the Nasa engineer. Older, traditional balls that have been internally stitched with the standard 32 panels \"knuckled\" at around 48 km/h (30 mph). \"The smoother you make the ball, the higher the speed at which it knuckles,\" says Dr Mehta. \"In essence what happened in my opinion is that with the traditional ball, the critical speed at which you got maximum knuckling was lower than the typical kicking speed in World Cup soccer. \"By making the ball smoother, that critical speed went up and happened to coincide with the typical kicking speeds, about 50, 55 mph (80, 88 km/h), especially in free kick situations.\" By making this year's ball rougher, according to Dr Mehta, \"we're back to square one\".  The texture of the Brazuca is rougher. \"They have what I would call tiny little pimples, which also would help in terms of the aerodynamics,\" says Dr Mehta. \"If you compare this to the Teamgeist (the official ball at the 2006 World Cup in Germany), the areas apart from the seams were very smooth. The rougher texture would also help solve other issues, like when you kick the ball there is more friction between the boot and the ball.\" But the major factor influencing the roughness is the geometry of the ball's seams. \"Seams are important because they determine to a large extent the roughness of the ball,\" Dr Mehta told the BBC. The Brazuca has six thermally bonded propeller-shaped panels, less than the eight of the Jabulani, the 14 of the Teamgeist or the 32 of traditional footballs. Adidas says the new seam geometry will give the ball aerodynamic accuracy and a stable flight. Fewer panels could actually make the ball smoother, but new ball's roughness is increased in other ways, says Dr Simon Choppin, a research fellow at the Centre for Sports Engineering Research at Sheffield Hallam University, who has measured the seams of the Brazuca. \"A colleague of mine, Dr John Hart, scanned the surface of the Brazuca and the Jabulani using a laser scanner. This gave us a 3-D model of the balls' seams to measure and analyse,\" Dr Choppin explains. \"We found that the depth of the Jabulani's seams is around 0.48 mm, while the new Brazuca football has seams 1.56 mm deep - more than three times deeper.  \"In addition, I measured the lengths of the seams on each ball by tracing them with string. The total length of the seams on the Jabulani is around 203cm and around 327cm on the Brazuca. Not only are the seams on the Brazuca deeper, but they're longer too.\" For Simon Choppin, the deeper and longer seams of the Brazuca, compared with the Jabulani, make it more like a traditional stitched football - and wind tunnel tests back up this assertion. Rougher balls also travel further. As a football flies through the air, its seams stir and agitate the air - like the dimples do on a golf ball or the fluff on a tennis ball, explains Dr Choppin. \"This agitation is essential for fast and reliable flight. A perfectly smooth ball experiences large amounts of drag and high aerodynamic forces.\" He added: \"The seams of a football disturb the flow of the air. \"This results in a smaller wake-area of low pressure - behind the ball - reducing the pressure difference and reducing the force, which slows the ball down. The lower drag force means the ball travels for a longer distance.\" So what was the final verdict of the scientists? \"I am pretty sure the Brazuca is going to behave more like the traditional 32-panel internally stitched ball, so the complaints we got in the last two World Cups will be minimised,\" says Rabi Mehta. For Simon Choppin, \"the seams are more effective agitators of the air, so the knuckling effect is less likely to occur at high speeds. I think the Brazuca will be more stable at high speed than its predecessors\". Dr Mehta says it's the knuckling effect that makes life difficult for goalkeepers.  \"What the players have figured out is that it is better to kick the ball with no spin or little spin,\" he says. \"They've been doing it for years, ever since I was a kid I saw some players kick it with their toes so that it doesn't spin much and that's trying to get the knuckling effect. \"For the Brazuca, the critical speed to get maximum knuckling effect is around 30mph (48km/h). For the Jabulani it was more like 50mph (80km/h).  \"So if the players are sitting there listening to me they should not kick the ball as hard now compared with 2010.\" ",
