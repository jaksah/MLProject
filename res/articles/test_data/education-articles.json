        "article": "There will be a stronger emphasis on maths skills and final end-of-course exams, as tougher, new-look GCSEs and A-levels for England are revealed. But science practicals will no longer count towards A-level grades, but will become a separate test. Maths skills will become more important in other subjects, such as physics, geography and economics. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the changes would correct \"pernicious damage\" caused by \"dumbing down\". \"Our changes will make these qualifications more ambitious, with greater stretch for the most able; will prepare young people better for the demands of employment and further study,\" said the education secretary. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman warned that schools and pupils faced \"enormous pressure\" and confusion during the switch to the new exams. \"Hastily implemented changes on such a scale carry an enormous risk,\" said Mr Lightman. The Royal Geographical Society backed the changes as a \"robust curriculum with an enhanced level of demand\" and said the \"explicit requirements for the use of mathematics and statistics in geography is also particularly welcome\".  But the decision by the Ofqual exam regulator to separate the mark for practicals from the main A-level grade in physics, chemistry and biology has drawn criticism from an alliance of science organisations. Score, which represents organisations including the Institute of Physics, Royal Society, Royal Society of Chemistry, the Society of Biology and the Association for Science Education, described Ofqual's plan as \"inadequate\". Prof Julia Buckingham, chair of Score and vice chancellor of Brunel University, says that universities looking at applications will see the A-level grade \"as a full reflection of a student's knowledge and ability\" and will miss the practical work \"which is an integral component of science learning\". The Campaign for Science and Engineering warned that \"uncoupling practicals from science A-level grades will lead to practicals being deprioritised\". Ofqual says the switch away from including science practical marks in A-level exam grades is because such assessed experiments have become a narrow and predictable process, with pupils' results \"bunched around the top of the scale\". The exam regulator has still to decide how science practicals should be assessed at GCSE. The announcements by the education secretary and the exam regulator set out the content and assessment of GCSEs and A-levels, which will be phased in from 2015 and 2016. The content of the subjects will include: A-levels, to be taught from September 2015: GCSEs, to be taught from September 2016: There have already been details set out for the first three of the new type of GCSE, which will be English language, English literature and maths, to be taught from September 2015. The education secretary has also announced that there will be more \"rigorous and demanding\" A-levels and GCSEs in arts subjects, including music, drama, art and dance. They will be taught from September 2016, alongside changes to A-levels in RE and design and technology. Changes to the structure of exams have already been announced - such as shifting from modules to exams at the end of two years. Last week, exam regulator Ofqual announced that new-style GCSEs would be graded from 9 to 1, with the highest grade to be twice as hard as an A*. Changes to the structure of exams have already been announced - such as shifting from modules to exams at the end of two years. Mr Lightman, leader of the Association for School and College Leaders, said he was \"very concerned about the amount of simultaneous change\". \"The success of these very ambitious changes will depend on effective implementation and high quality communication and preparation for schools from the awarding bodies. \"We still have not seen specific content for the exams nor details of how it will be assessed. Therefore there is no way of saying with any certainty that these new qualifications will be tougher than what is now in place.\" ",

        "article": "The number of teachers and support staff working in England's state schools has risen to a record level of 1.3 million people. These annual census figures show there are about 220,000 more full-time-equivalent teaching and assistant posts in schools compared with 2005. The profile of teachers shows a very large majority are female and white. It means that more than one in 12 women in England's workforce has a job in a school. The Department for Education, which published the report, says the record numbers of staff show \"there has never been a better time to be a teacher\". But Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has warned the figures show a 16% increase in teachers working in schools without teaching qualifications. This snapshot of people working in England's schools last November shows that the workforce grew every year in the previous eight years, regardless of changes in government or economic cycles. The number of teachers rose by about 9,000 compared with 2012, driven by a surge in the birthrate and rising primary school rolls. There are now 451,100 full-time-equivalent teachers and 471,000 assistants and support staff. Figures on any changes to the teacher-pupil ratio are not yet available. Source: Department for Education But the overall staff numbers, including teaching assistants, have climbed continuously in the years since 2005 - up from about 700,000 full-time-equivalent posts to 922,000 in 2013. A proportion of these are part-time jobs, with the total number of people working in schools, including teachers, teaching assistants and support staff, now reaching 1.3 million. About three in four teachers are female - and an even higher proportion of assistants. It means there are more than a million women working in schools in England - out of a total of 11.7 million women currently in employment. A high proportion of teachers are white - about 93% - with only 1% of teachers classified as black Caribbean. The figures show that teaching is now an almost entirely graduate profession, with 96% holding degrees. These degrees do not always match the subjects they are teaching. More than one in five secondary school maths teachers and about a third of geography teachers do not have a relevant degree. But Labour has attacked the rise in teachers without qualified teacher status, increasing by the equivalent of 2,300 full-time posts to 17,100. The workforce census says that 3.8% of teachers in state-funded schools, including academies and free schools, do not have qualified teacher status, up from 3.3% in 2012. Within free schools, the figures show 13% of full-time equivalent posts are held by teachers without qualified teacher status. Mr Hunt claimed this was a threat to standards: \"The evidence from the best-performing school systems around the world shows us that the quality of teaching makes the biggest difference to raising school standards.\" The average salary for a full-time qualified teacher is \u00a338,100 - slightly higher in secondary than primary, slightly higher in local authority schools than in academies. For senior staff, such as heads, deputies and assistant heads, secondary academies pay an average of \u00a362,300 - slightly higher than in local authority schools. The National Union of Teachers says this shows that \"academies and free schools are paying excessive salaries to principals at the expense of spending on pupils and pay for other teachers\".   A Department for Education spokesman welcomed the rising proportion of graduates in teaching - and rejected the claims about rising numbers of teachers without qualified teacher status (QTS). \"It is entirely right that state schools should enjoy the same advantage that private schools have to bring great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists into the classroom. It is entirely up to head teachers who they employ and we trust their judgment in getting the mix right for the pupils they know best. \"In fact, today's statistics show there are 700 fewer non-QTS teachers in schools than there were in 2010, while the percentage of non-QTS teachers in academies is down from 9.4% in 2010 to 5.3%.  \"Overall the quality of the teaching workforce is rising. A record 96% of all teachers now have degrees or above, meaning there are an extra 43,000 teachers with degree level qualifications in classrooms since 2010.\"  ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. The report praised \"positive\" learning conditions but found many weaknesses A major review of the schools system says the Welsh government lacks a long-term vision for education and does not do enough to support teachers. The Welsh government asked the worldwide   to conduct the review in 2012. The report praised \"positive\" learning conditions but found many weaknesses. The most recent Pisa international education tests, which are run by the OECD,  Those   were taken by 500,000 15-year-olds in 68 countries. The OECD review said: \"From an international perspective, the performance of 15-year-olds in Wales on Pisa is low overall, and there are too many students performing at low levels.  \"The Pisa 2012 reading and science assessments showed that almost one in five Welsh students did not achieve level two which is considered the baseline of proficiency at which students begin to demonstrate competencies to actively participate in life.  The pace of reform has been high and lacks a long-term vision, an adequate school improvement infrastructure and a clear implementation strategy all stakeholders share\u201d \"For mathematics this proportion was even higher, almost 30%. These levels are among the lowest in OECD countries.\" But the report said that schools in Wales offered positive learning environments with good teacher-student relations and classrooms conducive to learning.  It also praised Welsh schools for minimising the gender difference in student performance.  Following   the Welsh government embarked on a series of changes to raise standards and performance.  Several reforms followed including the introduction of the   for five to 14-year-olds in September 2012, which a year later became a statutory part of the national curriculum.  Statutory   in years two to nine were introduced last May. But according to the report the Welsh government had tried to do too much too soon. It said: \"The pace of reform has been high and lacks a long-term vision, an adequate school improvement infrastructure and a clear implementation strategy all stakeholders share.\"  Media requires JavaScript to play. One of the most controversial reforms by the Welsh government is school banding, introduced in 2011.  Teaching unions have argued it does not reflect what is happening in schools and that the requirements change from year to year.  The report largely agreed with that, but added  the Welsh government should consider making the school banding calculation method more transparent. The report also criticised the standards of teachers in Wales, and the lack of options for career progression and professional development for teachers and head teachers. But it said schools in Wales found it difficult to recruit high-calibre teachers, which may be a result of the standard of applicants on teacher training courses. Successive Welsh education ministers have made attempts to place more emphasis on tackling the link between poverty and low educational achievements.   Media requires JavaScript to play. The OECD said stability and a \"long-term path\" was required There are several schemes which aim to raise the attainment of pupils from the poorest families, such as the pupil deprivation grant, but the report claimed the system was too complex.  Responding to the findings, Education Minister Huw Lewis told BBC Radio Wales a reform programme was already \"tackling\" and \"grappling\" with the issues. \"We also need to think about the medium and the long term and that's why later on this spring, for instance, I will be making further announcements around our support programme concerning training for teachers,\" he said. \"I'm very concerned that we have the proper support network around the professionals that are delivering at the sharp end and I want to make sure they're getting everything that they need.\" This is the first time we have had a major, independent report that has been so critical of the Welsh government. Many of the points it raises echo what teaching unions and opposition parties have been saying for some time. Huw Lewis refuses to accept what the OECD says about reforms going ahead too quickly. Instead he says there will be a period of calm for the next couple of years with no new policy initiatives. There is a major review of the curriculum underway, but we will not get the full report for 18 months and it will not be introduced for about four years. The minister will attend this week's OECD's education policy committee meeting in Paris to discuss the report's findings. The National Union of Teachers in Wales said the sector has to be given better support in delivering new initiatives and that they must be less \"knee-jerk in their formation\". The ATL Cymru union said the report should make uneasy reading for ministers but Dr Christopher Howard, of NAHT Cymru, said it was one of the most \"honest, objective, rounded and helpful reports\" in the last few years. The Conservatives called it \"yet another scathing report\" while Plaid Cymru accused the Welsh government of \"blaming the education sector for failures when it hasn't given a clear indication of what the sector is setting out to achieve\".

        "article": "A programme to tackle forced marriage and \"honour\" based abuse has been launched by an East Midlands further education college. Derby College is working with charity Karma Nirvana to train personal coaches and \"safeguarding officers\" to recognise and deal with the issue. Karma Nirvana has campaigned to make forced marriage a crime.  The college will also hold awareness sessions for students, and publicise help lines that support victims.   It is claimed as the first further education college in the UK to launch such a programme.  The founder of Karma Nirvana, Jasvinder Sanghera, was compelled to leave school without qualifications when her family attempted to force her into marriage.  She avoided it by running away from home, and later studied A levels at Derby College as a mature student. She said it was \"highly appropriate\" the college was now taking the lead on the issue.  \"It was this organisation that set me on the road to finding my voice and having the confidence to start campaigning for awareness around the world,\" she said.  \"It was a huge decision for me to return to education as my abusers always told me that I was worthless and incapable. \"My sisters and I were never encouraged to read and often told that there was no point in having an education and I would become someone's wife one day.  \"Being introduced to literature for the first time was amazing and liberating.\" Ms Sanghera said that the new programme was urgently needed, and that its timing was opportune.  \"The summer holidays are a time when families often take young girls out of education and send them overseas to marry a stranger from a photograph,\" she said.  \"It is vital that all young people know about the issue of forced marriage and abuse and recognise that there is specialist support at the college to help them find the courage to take control of their lives.\" Derby College's chief executive Mandie Stravino said she hoped the programme would encourage other educational establishments to \"take the issue seriously\".  \"Colleges such as ourselves have an important role to play, not only in supporting our learners to the next stage of their lives and ensuring that they have the skills that employers need, but also in moulding the citizens and leaders of the future.\" ",

        "article": "A government parenting class pilot scheme has been dubbed a \"flop\" after just 4% of eligible parents took part. The CanParent scheme which saw parents given \u00a3100 to spend on classes ended up costing \u00a31,088 per parent, figures obtained by Labour suggest. Shadow children and families minister Lucy Powell described the scheme which attracted just 2,000 out of a possible 55,200 as an \"embarrassing failure\". The government said it would continue to work closely with CanParent. The CanParent initiative offered classes for every parent and carer of children up to the age of five in three local authorities - Middlesbrough, Camden and High Peak between June 2012 and March 2014.  More than 50,000 parents in CanParent areas were able to access vouchers worth \u00a3100 to spend on classes through health visitors, midwives, doctor's surgeries and children's centres - and were available at branches of Boots.  But Ms Powell discovered from a Parliamentary Question that just 4% of parents took part in the scheme which cost \u00a32m. The scheme was launched in 2011 by the then children's minister Sarah Teather and ran between April 2012 and January 2014. At the time, David Cameron said: \"Parents want help. It is in our interest as a society to help people bring up their children.\" The classes, provided by parenting experts, covered areas such as communication and listening skills, managing conflict and \"strengthening positive relationships in the family\", as well as the importance of parents working as a team. Discipline was also to be stressed, with \"firm, fair and consistent approaches\" encouraged and the importance of \"boundaries\" being set out for children. And there was advice on appropriate play for children's age and development. Ms Powell said: \"Parenting classes are a valued early intervention service but parents struggling under a cost-of-living crisis to balance work and family life are finding it harder and harder to access the help they need.\"  The Department for Education said: \"We are committed to helping parents access the vital help and advice they need in the early years of their child's life.\" \"CanParent offers a wide range of high quality, universal parenting classes and 99% of those who completed their course said they would recommend classes to others.\" ",

        "article": "A former teacher at a Birmingham school alleged to be part of an \"Islamic takeover plot\" says concerns were first raised more than 20 years ago. Michael White, who was dismissed in 2003 from Park View School, in Alum Rock, said its board of governors was \"taken over by a Muslim sect\" in 1993. He said he told the local education authority (LEA) but his claims were not investigated.  Tahir Alam, chair of governors at Park View, denied Mr White's claims. Birmingham City Council said it was unable to comment on historic or current allegations while investigations were ongoing. Mr White said Park View's board of governors was reorganised after the school was put into special measures by Ofsted in 1993. He said there was an increase in female students covering their hair within months of Mr Alam's appointment. \"The LEA was well aware of what was going on,\" he said. \"They told me they didn't want to exchange one set of problems for another.\" Mr White said he was \"forced out\" after he challenged governors' attempts to ban sex education and stop the teaching of non-Islamic faiths in religious education classes. In 2003 he was dismissed for gross misconduct after he handed a letter to prospective teachers advising them to question the governors, he said. Mr White, who has since retrained as an electrician, said the \"stress\" of the disciplinary process meant he had not spoken publicly about his suspicions until he saw media coverage of the \"Trojan Horse\" letter. The message, apparently written to a contact in Bradford, claimed responsibility for leadership changes at four Birmingham schools. It says the method of doing so - detailed over four pages - has been \"tried and tested\". Investigations are taking place into   have been targeted by Islamic extremists.  Ofsted has confirmed it is undertaking a number of unannounced inspections at Birmingham schools at the request of the Department for Education (DfE).   Adderley Primary School was visited on Wednesday and Thursday.   Inspectors have also visited Nansen Primary and Golden Hillock schools. Mr Alam, who has dismissed the letter as a hoax, said there was \"no truth\" in Mr White's allegations. \"It was such a long time ago, I think it's a misreading of what the reality was at the time of his departure,\" he said. The National Union of Teachers said the allegations in the letter were evidence the government's free schools and academy policies were open to abuse. A spokesman said \"thousands of schools\" had been taken over by minority interests, including businesses and other religions, since the policy was introduced. The DfE said it was unable to comment on the circumstances of Mr White's departure from the school as it was more than 10 years ago. Education Secretary Michael Gove said it was \"vitally important\" to \"get to the bottom of the allegations\". He said: \" In due course more action will be taken. It's important though that we take that action based on facts rather than rumour.\" Mr Gove added an Ofsted report into one of the schools identified would be \"published soon\". ",

        "article": "Does a common future mean that South East Asia should be able to agree a common past?   Educationalists and historians have been meeting across borders to attempt the seemingly impossible - a common history textbook for South East Asia. Not only will they have to accommodate diverse countries and a tangle of overlapping disputes, they have to contend with countries wanting to revise their history books to reflect territorial claims. This ambitious task is taking place within the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) group of countries - Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.  Textbook experts from the region met in Bangkok in Thailand last year to look at the idea of a common history.  \"There are still fundamental miscommunications, deeply-held prejudices and emotionally-charged perceptions which we have to overcome,\" a former Asean secretary-general, Dr Surin Pitsuwan, told the meeting, organised by Unesco. \"This is just the first step in what will be a very long and complex process,\" says Tim Curtis, chief of the culture unit of Unesco's Asia Pacific regional office. \"Revising history textbooks is a never-ending story. But that does not mean we should not start.\" Thai history scholar Kasetsiri Charnvit was succinct: \"Bad history, bad education, bad neighbour relations.\" The move towards an Asean single market in 2015 provides an extra impetus. As countries come together as an economic group it will allow free movement, trade and educational exchanges.   \"It's a good starting point. People are willing to come together to talk about it,\" said Ivy Maria Lim, a historian and assistant professor at Singapore's National Institute of Education and co-editor of Controversial History Education in Asian Contexts. The idea of a common Asean history textbook emerged after the Preah Vihear temple dispute between Cambodia and Thailand. Both claimed sovereignty over temple land on their common border. Fighting erupted in 2011 after troop build-ups on both sides when Cambodia applied for Unesco World Heritage status for the site in 2008, interpreted as a claim over the area. Other historical disputes, some going back centuries, involve Thailand and Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, among others.  Beyond the Asean countries, there are separate disputes between China and Japan in the East China Sea, and competing claims in the South China Sea which have escalated recently. In January, Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung asked the Ministry of Education to include Vietnam's sovereignty over parts of the disputed Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea in school textbooks. Vietnam disputes sovereignty of the Paracels with China, while other Asean countries, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines claim parts of the Spratlys, as do China and Taiwan in a tangle of claims and counter claims.  In such a climate, textbook writing is fraught with risk and governments can be reluctant to yield any ground.   Governments wield \"very strong control over what goes in textbooks, what is written in the curriculum, how they want it to be taught\", said Dr Lim.  \"In South East Asia, the need to foster patriotism is felt acutely,\" says Filomeno Aguilar, Professor of History at Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines. Governments assert their claims over disputed territory through the rewriting of history textbooks - at the same time as air-bushing versions that could lead to opposing claims. \"It infects histories with political bias and prevents coverage of topics not allowed by the state,\" Prof Aguilar notes. The approach in many Asean countries, says Prof Aguilar, is to suppress difficult topics in history. Sometimes this is justified as wanting to avoid antagonising neighbours.  Not every South East Asian country is keen on a joint history. Some wanted to get around the thorny problem of reconciling conflicting narratives by promoting the idea of a regional Asean identity, rather than a common history.  But, says Prof Aguilar, such a regional economic grouping is not a \"neat fit\" for individual countries' histories. Because of vast differences in culture, languages, religion as well as colonial experiences, there isn't a shared Asean history.  One of the few commonalities between many of the countries has been wartime Japanese rule. It might not be a dimension they want to explore - and Japan has taken a  . Prof Tokushi Kasahara, a progressive Japanese historian who has worked for years on a joint history textbook with South Korean and Chinese academics, does not believe that Japan will co-operate with Asean on re-examining history. \"Frankly there is no desire or will to create a joint history textbook with other nations among Japanese historians and educationalists,\" said Prof Tokushi.  Yet he continues undaunted working on a common North East Asian history, History of the Three Countries of East Asia. \"The prospect of achieving a common historical understanding will surely be realised only when citizens living in East Asia learn the truth of the regions' history of wars of aggression and colonial rule, and then engage in repeated dialogue and debate over how best to overcome these legacies of the past,\" said Prof Tokushi. There are few successful precedents.   Prof Tokushi and academics from China, Japan and South Korea have spent years thrashing out differences in a non-governmental history textbook commission, without support from politicians.  If there are too many differences to be reconciled for a joint textbook, the Asean group could still produce joint guidelines on the way history could be taught in Southeast Asia. That's the view of Eckhardt Fuchs, deputy director of the Georg Eckert Institute for International Textbook Research in Germany, invited by Unesco to advise the Asean group.  At least this could give people a \"perspective that goes beyond their own national narrative,\" said Dr Fuchs, after South Korean President Park Geun-Hye proposed a common textbook as a way to build peace and economic cooperation in North East Asia.  The president had referred to the German-French joint history textbook as a model, published in 2006. \"It shows us that communication and collaboration on a joint textbook is possible. Once you sit together and discuss problems, there is a way to resolve them,\" said Dr Fuchs.  But it requires strong political will. \"The lesson we learned in Germany is that you cannot escape history. You have to come to terms with it as a country or society or even groups within society.  If you don't, you are not going to have peace. At some point these conflicts break out again,\" said Dr Fuchs.  ",

        "article": "Students in Shanghai have the highest results in international Pisa tests. But what is the state of education for China's rural poor, far away from the showcase cities? Andreas Schleicher, who runs the Pisa tests, went to find out. About 1,900 miles south west of Shanghai is Qiao Tou Lian He elementary school.  It's an hour's drive from the town of Tengchong, which might seem a small distance in comparison, but most of the school's children have never made it to Tengchong.  Providing an education for children in such sparsely-populated rural areas is one of China's major challenges. While the economic and social development of these rural regions has been remarkable, China's coastal cities are racing ahead at an even faster pace. That fuels an endless stream of people moving to the cities - students looking for better education, parents looking for work, but also good teachers who are looking for more fulfilling careers.  Shanghai alone registers 1,000 additional cars each day bought by those who have made it up the social ladder. But what about those children who remain behind in the rural areas or in the mountains? China has begun to consolidate rural schools into bigger schools which can provide a critical mass of teachers and services. It is never easy to amalgamate schools like this. For generations schools have been the heart of villages and when the children leave, communities see their future endangered.  There have been serious implementation problems, most notably around transportation, that have bogged down progress and in some areas brought the merger process to a halt.  But Qiao Tou Lian He school is an example that is well on its way.  It offers children from four former remote schools educational opportunities that neither they nor their parents could have ever had in their villages. In terms of standards, the maths classes seem to be at least at the same level you would see in a European classroom. As in Shanghai, virtually all of the students perform at a level that is consistently high. And keep in mind, these are children whose parents will usually have had no education whatsoever. The first thing that catches the eye is that in this poor neighbourhood of simple houses and farmlands, it is the school rather than the shopping centre that has the cleanest and most impressive building. Most of the children stay for the week as they have to walk for several hours to reach their homes, so the school has become their family.  However, this school of 714 children can afford just 29 staff, which means that these primary school children have to assume an incredible amount of individual and social responsibility, with very limited social and emotional support from adults.  Their dormitory is an array of tiny rooms that each hold 12 beds and 18 children. The rooms are in impeccable order, with the belongings of each child tidily arranged.  A cheerful squad of 10, 11 and 12 year olds walk from room to room, with notebooks in which they record issues around hygiene and discipline. They help the smaller children as best as they can.  An extraordinary workload rests on the small teaching staff. There are teaching and non-teaching duties, which leaves just a single teacher to oversee the social life of this dormitory, with the many needs of these hundreds of small children. Education systems around the world want to make children \"resilient\", so that they can persist in a changing world, trying, failing, adapting, learning and evolving.  Few children will be better prepared for this than the students of Qiao Tou Lian He school, even if the price for this is so high.  It will not be easy when the students go home, they often have no one to talk to, their parents may be working far away, and even if they are at home, they may not understand the world that is opening up to these children. Teaching conditions in Qiao Tou Lian He school are tough. In many countries, results can be severely impeded if a quarter or more of the students come from disadvantaged educational backgrounds. Here every child comes from a poor background. In Shanghai, teachers have smaller classes and can rely on much better initial preparation and more extensive training. They spend 70% of their time teaching and 30% of their time learning, often in collaboration with teachers from other schools.  Qiao Tou Lian He is on its own. But the teachers here show an amazing commitment and have a positive atmosphere in every classroom. It is rigorous, highly disciplined and yet joyful.  The dynamic leader of the school is Mr Huang, who became a principal at the age of 25 not because he had specific training, but because he had been the only educated person in his village. He has an impressive vision and determination to overcome whatever barriers stand in the way of advancing his school. He is squarely focused on supporting, developing and evaluating his teachers, only a handful of whom have a high school degree and more than basic teacher training.  Mr Huang helps teachers to work together to develop good practice and wants to provide intelligent pathways for their careers.  There are competitions for teachers here too and one of the language classes is taught by a local competition winner. Over lunch in his office, Mr Huang explains how he works with individual teachers on any weaknesses in their practices. He motivates his teachers to make the necessary changes. There are high expectations and a collective belief in their ability to make a difference for every child. Teachers and principal seem to share the belief in the possibilities for all children to achieve. Mr Huang keeps close track of teacher performance, looking at both student achievement and classroom management. Over time, he also hopes to bring parents along, offering workshops for them not just on how to support their children's education but also on how to become good parents. It requires effort from children too. A pupil called Min explains that his greatest joy is to read books in a bookstore, not around the corner, but a good two-hour walk from his home. There are also projects to improve the quality of teaching. Teach for China is supporting more than 80 schools by recruiting some of the most promising young graduates who will teach in rural schools for two years. China seems to have been able to convince its citizens to make sacrifices today for a better future tomorrow.  This is a country where everyone is willing to learn, students are learning for a better life, teachers are learning to improve their teaching, schools compare themselves eagerly with other schools and, perhaps most importantly, the system as a whole is willing and able to learn. Whether China wants to design a better sewer system, retirement system or school system, it sends key people in the relevant sector to visit the world's best performers.  They find out how they do it and try to put together a design for China that is superior to anything that they have seen anywhere else.  ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Ofqual's Glenys Stacey outlines the 'top grade' plan A new top-level GCSE grade will be awarded to the most talented 20,000 pupils each year, in proposals for a shake-up of England's exam grades. The Ofqual exam regulator has launched a consultation on a grading system that will rank from nine at the very top down to one for the lowest performers. The changes, to be introduced from 2017, will also link exam grades to international Pisa tests. Ofqual's Glenys Stacey says it will improve the \"calibration\" of exams. But head teachers leaders suggested there were still \"parts of the puzzle missing\". The substantial changes, being put out for consultation, would provide a much clearer distinction between high-flying pupils currently achieving A and A* grades. The highest grade - to be described as a grade nine - will be awarded to only half the pupils now achieving an A*, according to Ofqual's proposals. In last summer's GCSE exams, there were 6.8% of pupils graded as A*. The new highest grade would be awarded to only the top 3%, or about 20,000 pupils. Under the new system, an A grade would equate to a grade seven - and the current C grade, widely seen as the pass level, would become a grade four. For the first time, there will be a link between England's exam grades and international benchmarks. The results of Pisa tests in competitor countries, which have become an influential measure for international comparisons, will be used to establish grade five. It will be expected to be set at about half or two-thirds of a grade higher than the current grade C. And it remains to be decided whether grade four or grade five will become the expected level in future, for measures such as school league tables and minimum standards for schools. A sample of pupils will also take a new test - the National Reference Test - which will be used to monitor the performance of each cohort, so that examiners will have a reference point for differences in ability between different year groups. These changes will begin with three subjects - maths, English language and English literature. These will be the first wave of tougher GCSEs, to be taught from September 2015, with the first awards under the proposed new system in summer 2017. Other subjects are planned to follow, including history, geography and some sciences. If adopted, the proposed changes would mean that GCSEs in England would have a different grading system and structure from GCSEs in Wales and Northern Ireland, extending the differences between the systems. Ofqual chief Glenys Stacey says the changes are intended to \"strengthen awarding\" and to give greater accuracy in grades. Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, \"broadly welcomed\" the proposals and hoped the consultation would help to address some of the \"discontent\" over marking and grades. But a high-performing independent school rejected the plans - and said it would be more likely to make them switch to International GCSEs. \"For years governments of different political complexions have mistakenly tried to use GCSE qualifications as a measure of both a young person's learning and a school's performance,\" said  Helen Stringer, vice-principal of the Stephen Perse Foundation school in Cambridge. \"This current proposal simply aims to extend this flawed system so that the qualification also has to become a measure of the quality of the national education system.\" Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association for School and College Leaders, said there were still \"parts of the puzzle\" missing in how the new system would work. \"Until it is made clear to teachers what students need to know in order to achieve a grade, and they have detailed specifications and sample questions, they will not be able to plan for these examinations.  \"While we understand the government's wish to raise the bar by aligning some grades to Pisa, this raises all kinds of issues. Pisa is a completely different kind of exam than the new GCSEs.   \"We welcome the proposal to introduce a reference test, which will help to make an objective judgement about whether standards have improved or not year or year. The careful consideration being given to different ways of awarding grades is also welcome.\" Chris Keates, leader of the Nasuwt teachers' union, warned that: \"Schools, parents and pupils are being thrown into further confusion over yet more reform to the qualifications system.\" ",

        "article": "It was a revolution moving higher education from bricks to clicks\u2026 and now it's started to go back to bricks again.  Online university providers, which offered people the chance to study from home, are turning full circle by creating a network of learning centres where students can meet and study together. Instead of demolishing the dusty old classrooms, the online university revolution is responsible for opening some new ones. Coursera, a major California-based provider of online courses, is creating an international network of \"learning hubs\", where students can follow these virtual courses in real-life, bricks and mortar settings. And there are thousands of meet-ups in cafes and libraries where students get together to talk about their online courses. This is the latest stage in the rapid evolution of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses - where some of the world's leading universities have created digital versions of courses which are offered free over the internet. Coursera now has seven million registered users. That's bigger than the entire university populations of the UK and France combined. But it seems there is an irresistible social side to learning. Finding stuff out together seems to be more appealing than following a course alone. The Coursera learning hubs are running in more than 30 cities, from Baghdad to Buenos Aires, Moscow to Mumbai and Shanghai to Santiago. The learning hubs are run by partner organisations, providing a place where students following Coursera online courses can come to study together and get help from mentors. In Moscow, the learning hub is hosted by Digital October, a centre for technology and entrepreneurship. Yulia Lesnikova, director of educational programs, says it provides a more sociable way of following online courses. \"Education is a two-way process\u2026 It's a shoulder to lean on,\" she says. Students can work in groups on practical projects together with experts available to give advice. \"Mentors give a lot of help to people who don't understand.\" There have been four online courses so far followed in the Moscow learning hub. This includes a course about genetics created by the University of British Columbia, with students in Moscow being supported by an expert from one of Russia's oldest genetics institutes. There is a course on gamification from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, with sub-titles in Russian. When students are gathered for their Mooc classes it becomes a focus for other spin-offs, such as firms wanting to recruit staff or to get students involved in developing commercial projects. In Beijing, the learning hub has been set up with Guokr, a Chinese science-based social networking website. Yang Liu, Guokr's education director, says studying as a group provides a way of keeping students connected. It's also introduced the word \"Moocer\" into China, she says. \"Learning can be very lonely, they can drop out.\" It can be a more effective way of studying, she says. In a group of people there's likely to be a spread of knowledge, with students able to help one another. \"It's like a village, they form a small society.\" It also allows for different types of learner to be supported. About half of the people following Coursera courses in Beijing are university students, she says. But there are also isolated individuals who like the social setting, such as older people living alone or mothers looking after children at home. Yin Lu, responsible for Coursera's international development, says learning hubs have a wide range of local approaches. They can be based around tutors or around organised projects or else emphasise the social aspect of learning. In India, the focus is on teacher training and professional development. It means that courses designed for students in the US or Europe are being played out in classrooms in New Delhi and Mumbai. What has become apparent, she says, is that there is a much lower drop-out rate for students who attend a learning hub. Moocs allow anyone to enter, with no barriers from cost or qualifications, but that also means relatively few ever finish a course. Ms Lu says that the typical completion rate for a Mooc is about 5% to 10%. For Mooc students attending learning hubs, the completion rates are between 30% and 100%, she says. Ms Lu says it's likely that more hubs will open where there are concentrations of Coursera students. But she says there are no plans for these learning hubs to become fully-fledged colleges, where students might take exams as well as follow courses.  \"We exist to complement what universities can provide,\" she says.  But it wouldn't be difficult to imagine the commercial possibilities if they changed their mind. There is something almost organic about how these digital projects have taken root in the physical world. Moocs were meant to be the university courses of the laptop era, self-sustaining and free-standing, with students able to stop and start materials on the internet and get online support from social networking. But you can't stop people from wanting to talk to each other, outside the computer screen. As well as the more formal learning hubs, self-organised \"meet-ups\" for Coursera students have sprung up in more than 3,700 cities around the world, based around specific Coursera online courses.  For example, in London there are groups meeting in cafes at the British Library and the South Bank Centre. In Paris, there are meetings in the Pompidou Centre and in university buildings. Meet-ups are held in a whole range of public places, where students want to discuss and debate these digital courses.  They're scheduled and arranged online, with the only vital ingredients being a laptop, wi-fi and somewhere to talk. Even virtual students want to have a cup of coffee and a conversation after a lecture.  Will students always want to meet up and talk, even if they are studying online? Will Moocs end up creating their own colleges and universities? If you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on.

        "article": "Lighter evenings are finally here, heralding the season of school exams.  But an increasing number of schools are looking at different ways of assessing their pupils' abilities and aptitudes.  Many have introduced psychometric assessments as a way of measuring, developing and instilling character and resilience into pupils.  Those are qualities business leaders want the education system to concentrate on, with the support of all shades of political opinion.   There are various kinds of psychometric assessments, but in the interests of BBC News (for whom I will pay any price, bear any burden) I took one.  Sally Wells from Thomas International, one of the leading assessment providers, agreed to help me through a Personal Profile Analysis (PPA).  I was sent a link by email, and was faced with a series of 24 questions.  The key to the assessments, Sally told me, is that they have to be completed quickly.  I had to say which adjective was most like me and least like me, for example, brave, inspiring, submissive and timid.  I do not think of myself as timid, so that part was easy. But inspiring? Brave?  The clock was ticking, and I just went with gut instinct. I finished the test in seven minutes.  \"You are precise, accurate, dependable, sincere, assertive, loyal and organised,\" Sally divulged.  The assessment gives pupils a positive set of words that they can use about themselves\u201d By this time I was blushing, but there was even better news.  \"You are also reflective, perfectionist, serious, withdrawn, systematic, detailed, logical, adaptable, quiet and sceptical,\" she continued. \"And you ask, 'How? Why? And what?'\" As this is pretty much how I have earned my living for the past 25 years, this should not have come as a surprise.  But as Sally continued, I was genuinely astonished by the detailed picture she had been able to build up of my character strengths and weaknesses.  \"Due to your ability to stand back, you can make logical decisions, uncluttered by personal involvement. But those decisions are unlikely to be made quickly, and you may resent being pressurised into any form of decision making.\" I was sent a detailed assessment, and it rings true to me. But how could it help a teenager?  Sally Wells told me that assessors talk to pupils confidentially one to one, and often that conversation alone is enough to make them feel better about themselves.  \"It gives them the opportunity to take ownership of their own behaviour,\" she said.  Woodhouse Grove School in West Yorkshire was founded 200 years ago by Methodists hoping to instil the virtues of their faith into a new generation. It has 1,000 pupils aged from two and a half to 18, and decided to use psychometric assessments for 14- to 15-year-old pupils in 2012.  Louise Watson, the school's senior tutor, is an enthusiastic supporter of the assessments.  \"They are a chance for a pupil to talk to someone who doesn't know them, has no preconceptions about them, but who has real knowledge of the real world. \"It's not about exams or just careers, it's about development.  \"The assessment gives pupils a positive set of words that they can use about themselves. \"Rather than pigeonholing themselves, the assessments allow them to see a bigger picture. \"We hear comments like, 'I can't believe how well they got me.'\" The growing use of the assessments comes at a time when employers and politicians are talking about ways of developing resilience and character in pupils, so that they can enter the jobs market as rounded citizens.  There is an emerging consensus that exam results alone are not enough to judge a pupil.  Louise Watson believes the assessments can play a key part in the promotion of resilience and character in pupils, but that they also contributed to a significant improvement in GCSE results.   \"The students come out with a personal action plan for development. It leads directly on to the development of skills that exams simply don't measure, but which are vital to success in life. \"Leadership, team-working and peer support are all vital for successful careers - whatever field they decide to go into.\" She says 45 of the last group of pupils to be assessed have been inspired to get involved in community work as a direct result.  \"They have seen the benefits of developing themselves and promoting their skills,\" she said.  \"That's certainly something that came out of these tests. Even pupils who might be otherwise considered 'under-aspiring' have gained from them.\" She believes the programme has also had significant benefits for teachers.  \"It's helped us look at ways of adapting our teaching to take account of the strengths and aptitudes of an individual pupil.\" As for me, I am delighted to have a positive set of words I can use about myself although \"withdrawn\".

        "article": "It's 20 years since The Spastics Society renamed itself Scope. Other disability charities have changed their names since. But in disability, what is a good name for a charity? In 1994 Blur and Oasis were slogging it out for the Britpop crown, Don't Forget Your Toothbrush was the hot TV show, John Major was our prime minister and people with cerebral palsy were still referred to as spastics.  Valerie Lang was on the executive council of the Spastics Society at the time. She has cerebral palsy and had been passionate about a name change for years before it eventually happened. \"I felt that we could not afford to stay with the name we had,\" she says. \"The name spastic was a playground term of abuse. Children would shout to each other 'You big spastic' every time someone was clumsy or even if they just disagreed with them.  \"Mothers with young babies who had cerebral palsy weren't seeking help from the society because they had heard the word used in playground parlance. I think it put the younger generation off.\"  Lang, now 74, says that people ceased to think of those with cerebral palsy as individuals. \"We might have a brain injury in common but we are all different and don't want to be put in a box labelled 'spastic'.\"  The charity made the change at an extraordinary general meeting in March 1994. The chairman at that time, Anthony Hewson, noted the tension in the room and was worried some of the wheelchair users in the room might \"wheel forward and lynch me\" if the wrong decision was made.  \"Scope\" was one of several names considered. Others were reminiscent of the single-word abstract names popular with companies in the 1990s - Clipper, Clasp, Canopy, Patch, Ibex, Adepta, Tasq, Fulcrum, Cognosis, Capability. Other more traditional names under discussion included Action Cerebral Palsy and the Cerebral Palsy Society.  Perhaps sadly, one of the big factors in choosing Scope, a largely neutral name with no obvious link to disability or cerebral palsy, was that it could not be turned into a term of abuse.  Since that time, other disability charities have come onto the scene with positive names such as Enable or Ability. Arguably this approach has itself become somewhat cliched, and may eventually come back to haunt the charities because of their earnest positivity. It's terribly difficult to get it right when it comes to disability which - despite undoubtedly improving attitudes - is still an uneasy subject matter.  Perhaps the most notable and dramatic of recent charity name changes is that of the Royal National Institute of Deaf People (RNID), which is now Action on Hearing Loss.  It was an important moment in our transition from being a traditional charity... to being an organisation that's about working alongside disabled people\u201d Chief Executive Paul Breckell says it was a strategic decision. The name is a better reflection of the charity's work, he explains, as it doesn't only work with deaf people. He says many people weren't very aware of the charity with its four-letter brand: \"The public confused us with similar names like RNIB, RNLI and RSPB. \"People don't always know what acronyms mean, they're clumsy and clunky and words like 'National Institute' have a tendency to date an organisation.\"  Mencap chooses to hold onto its name despite it being a splicing together of \"mentally handicapped\", a term now deemed inappropriate by many. Even the charity uses the phrase \"learning disability\" to describe the people it helps. (As a reminder of how far attitudes have changed, it's interesting to note that Mencap was actually called the Association of Parents of Backward Children when it was founded in 1946).  The charity defends its present name, and says that a change is not going to make any difference to the problems faced by people with learning disabilities. It points out that the name has, as it were, brand recognition and is widely recognised by the public and by politicians. Certainly, although the name may have its detractors, Mencap is a modern-thinking organisation which involves people with learning disabilities in its decision-making. Though seen as a model for changing brand name, Scope has never rebuilt its brand awareness. Whereas 90% used to know what the Spastics Society was, only 64% answer \"yes\" when asked: \"have you heard of Scope?\" However, the charity says that although awareness may have declined, charitable income has not been affected.  Richard Hawkes, Scope's chief executive, says it was a real risk to drop one of the UK's best-known charity brand names, but it was important to make a strong statement that attitudes towards disabled people needed to change. \"It was an important moment in our transition from being a traditional charity that helped vulnerable beneficiaries to being an organisation that's about working alongside disabled people to make change happen. \"Changing the name meant we could be side by side with all disabled people - who at that time were campaigning for important changes, like the introduction of the Disability Discrimination Act.\" ",

        "article": "Universities in Myanmar have been given e-libraries with hundreds of thousands of digital books and academic journals to help them catch up after decades of isolation under military rule. The University of Yangon and University of Mandalay have switched on these instant library collections, which represent another sign of how the country - also known as Burma - is opening up to outside influences. Students and staff can search databases and download books and articles onto computers in the library. The next aim is to give students access in their own rooms and using their own laptops. After years of being cut off from the academic mainstream, the online libraries are reconnecting Myanmar's universities with current and uncensored scholarship. It can take decades or even centuries to build a university library collection. But this library for the 21st Century is available as quickly as the new fibre-optic connections will allow.  In Myanmar, it means leaping forward to a collection of 130,000 digital texts. Oleksandr Shtokvych, of the Open Society Foundations, which supported the project, says it would not have been practical or affordable to wait for a traditional library of printed volumes. There was an immediate need for up-to-date materials. \"The libraries were depositories of ancient materials, more like museum exhibits,\" he says. Mouldering books in the library were still stuck with the ideas of 50 or 60 years ago, he says, making it difficult for academics to maintain international standards. They were also constrained by having to comply with a controlling state. It was symptomatic of a decaying university system. What made the need for improvement even more urgent was the return of the first undergraduates to the University of Yangon campus for over two decades.  Universities had been seen as centres of resistance to military rule and heavily restricted. Yangon's university had been one of the most prestigious in South East Asia, but had been caught in a cycle of protests, repression and shutdowns. Opposition politician Aung San Suu Kyi had warned that the country's \"university system has almost been destroyed by half a century of military rule\".  \"Campus life ceased to exist several decades ago,\" she said. But as part of Myanmar's reforms in recent years, universities have been given greater freedoms, and young students have now returned to rejuvenate neglected campuses. This wave of young recruits, the first undergraduates here after missing a generation, were selected as the \"brightest and best\" from their year group and have arrived with high expectations. Susanna Lob, of Electronic Information for Libraries (EIFL), a non-profit organisation that worked with the universities in creating the e-libraries, says: \"Online resources were the obvious way to go.\" As well as giving instant access to such a wide range of resources, a digital library allows unlimited numbers of students to use the same book or journal at the same time. The new students are hungry to learn and speak good English, she says, and the e-library will give them the range of materials they would expect from a modern university. As well as books, there are magazines, newspaper collections and research archives. EIFL negotiated with publishers to reduce the cost of the online library, with the titles provided worth $1.5m (\u00a3900,000). Prof Kyaw Naing, pro-rector of the University of Yangon, says the e-library marks an important step forward. He describes the frustration of previously being unable to access international academic journals and says that it will help to raise the quality of learning. Higher education is a globalised, networked world and being excluded from it undermines academic credibility. \"We can't go back, we want to go forward,\" says Prof Naing. Chief librarian, Daw Hlaing Hlaing Gyi, says how delighted she is to see the library \"busier than ever\". There have been other international library links. More than 5,000 law reports, statutes and textbooks have been donated by Oxford University's Bodleian Law Library to help the law department at Yangon. Oxford is also providing training in university administration. Partnerships of US universities and businesses, including Johns Hopkins University, the University of Washington and Microsoft, have plans to bring teaching and training to Myanmar. It's also seen as an emerging market. In February, 30 US universities were in Yangon, the official name for Rangoon, trying to recruit students. The University of Manchester, in another project funded by the Open Society Foundations, is providing online learning materials for a network of universities in Myanmar. The Open Society Foundations was set up by the investor George Soros - and most of its work has been in supporting the transition of former Communist countries to democracy. And alongside the process of opening up Myanmar's universities to the rest of the academic world, there is also a political dimension. The online library will open up a channel of information to young people, providing them with competing ideas and arguments from outside their once tightly controlled borders. Once this idea of open debate and information has been released, it becomes much harder to return to censorship. \"We want to develop critical thinking,\" says Mr Shtokvych. \"Once the genie is out of the bottle, you cannot chase it back.\" ",

        "article": "A third of students in England, who pay up to \u00a39,000 in tuition fees, say their degree course is poor or very poor value for money, a study indicates.   A survey of 15,046 UK students found they have just 10 minutes extra with university lecturers despite the rise - for the majority - in fees since 2012. The findings are revealed by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and the Higher Education Academy (HEA). The government said students, \"quite rightly\", had higher expectations. Higher tuition fees in England mean undergraduates currently in the first or second year of university study are paying up to \u00a39,000 a year. The Hepi and HEA research found today's students in England  were more likely to say their course was poor value compared to 2012 - before the fee hike. One third of current first- and second-year students (33%) said they were receiving poor or very poor value for money, compared with 18% in 2012. And just 36% of these students thought their course represented good value for money, compared with 52% in 2012.   But the study found  students in Scotland were more likely to say their course was worth the money, with  70% of those at Scottish universities rating their course as good or very value. However, Scottish students pay no tuition fees, if they study at a university in Scotland.  The Hepi/HEA report says regional differences in perceptions of value for money are \"not unexpected given that Scottish and other EU-domiciled students from outside the UK, who constitute the vast majority of students at Scottish institutions, effectively pay no fees\". When asked what their top three priorities would be for institutional expenditure, 48% of UK students polled said \"reducing fee levels\", followed by having more teaching hours and reducing the size of teaching groups (both 35%). The survey also found 31% said they would definitely or maybe have chosen another course if they were to have their time again. The survey found that in the first and second years of their degree, undergraduates have an average of 14.2 hours of \"contact\" time - for example time spent in lectures and seminars, and spend another 14.3 hours on average in private study. This is much less than the 40 hours a week of study suggested in the Quality Assurance Agency's (QAA) guidelines, the report said. The findings show students do not attend about 9% of lectures and seminars laid on by their university, with the most common reasons for absence  being that undergraduates did not find the lectures very useful and that the notes were available online. Universities minister David Willetts said: \"Young people are more serious about their education than ever before. Universities need to raise their game [...] I don't think universities are worse, but students have higher expectations, quite rightly.\" Mr Willetts  said institutions would now have to do \"far better\" than simply offering lectures with 500 students sitting in a room taking notes from slides on a screen. He added: \"The days where the academic experience is simply sitting in rows with 500 other people taking notes from slides on a screen that you can access online on your laptop, universities now have to do far better than that.\" Nick Hillman, director of Hepi, said: \"The data suggest growing differences across the UK. Students in Scotland generally think they are getting good value for money.  \"Meanwhile, students in England are paying much more but receiving only a little more. In England, one in three students say they are getting poor value for money - nearly twice as high as before the \u00a39,000 fees were introduced. \"In this election year, students should press all the political parties to say what they will do to encourage universities to offer world-class teaching alongside their world-class research.\" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \"The increase in fees in England and the shift away from public funding to higher graduate contributions means that students are clearly demanding more from their courses.  \"The important thing is ensuring that students have enough information about their courses and that the experience matches their expectations. \"Due to the quality of its degrees, the UK has one the strongest and most highly respected higher education systems in the world.\" Sonia Sodha, head of public services policy at the consumer magazine Which?, said: \"A key problem is a lack of information that makes it difficult for students to make a fully informed choice. We want better data to be included in the key information set such as the amount and type of scheduled teaching.\" ",

        "article": "Thousands of letters are to be sent to single parents in Britain informing them of changes to their child maintenance arrangements. The government wants parents to agree their child maintenance agreements \"amicably\" or face a charge. It said the changes were necessary as the old set-up was costly for taxpayers. But a charity said the changes could force some parents into \"unstable\" arrangements. Child maintenance is financial support that helps towards a child's living costs when its parents have separated. If parents split, maintenance should be paid to the person who takes care of the child on a day-to-day basis. Under the old system many single parents used the Child Support Agency (CSA) to sort out maintenance payments, but ministers  . A government spokesman said the old CSA was using an IT system that was \"totally inadequate and notoriously riddled with defects\", and as such it was costing \u00a374 million per annum to run in operating costs alone. The spokesman added that the old maintenance system \"took responsibility away from parents, encouraging conflict and hostility at huge expense to the taxpayer\". In an effort to improve the situation the new replacement \"Child Maintenance Service\" has been gradually rolled out, which the government said is designed to act as a backstop for parents having trouble. This week more than 50,000 letters are being sent out by the Department for Work and Pensions to parents in England, Scotland and Wales who currently pay and receive child maintenance through the old CSA.  Ministers want to encourage people to come to voluntary arrangements but if that is not possible - and the new statutory service is used - then both parties will be charged.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Under the new rules if an amicable arrangement cannot be reached the paying parent - usually the father - will have a 20% fee added to the maintenance payment, while the receiving parent will pay 4% to get the money. The charges will be introduced later this year, and all single parents will be charged an upfront fee of \u00a320 for registering with the new service. However, the chief executive of the single-parent charity Gingerbread, Fiona Weir, said she was \"concerned\" by the reforms. She said: \"While many parents are able to agree private child maintenance arrangements, for many other parents, this just isn't possible without government help.  \"We're very concerned that closing CSA cases and bringing in charges may deter some parents from making new child maintenance agreements or pressure single parents into unstable arrangements, and children will lose out on vital support.\" For further help and assistance with child maintenance parents can visit  .

        "article": "University leaders in the UK have written an open letter saying membership of the European Union is central to their efforts to \"drive innovation and growth\". The letter, signed by the president of Universities UK, says involvement in Europe is a positive benefit for higher education. It says that the UK is the largest beneficiary of EU research grants. The Open Europe think tank rejected this as a \"weak argument\". The intervention from the body representing UK universities highlights the importance of being involved in decision-making within the European Union. The letter sent to the Times newspaper was signed by Sir Christopher Snowden, president of Universities UK and vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey. It was signed by more than 20 other vice-chancellors who are on the board of Universities UK. \"Without an influential voice in the development of EU policy, the UK would lose its ability to influence policy affecting research and higher education,\" says the letter. \"The UK benefits directly from \u00a31.2bn annually in European research funding and is the largest beneficiary of EU research funds to universities.  \"This supports UK-based research and transnational research projects which pool knowledge to solve social and economic challenges in a way that no country acting alone could do.\" This argument was rejected by the Open Europe think tank, which is against greater European integration. \"While it is true that UK universities do well from EU funding, the wider context is that the UK is a major net contributor to the EU budget and only a small percentage of EU funds are spent on research and development,\" said research director Stephen Booth. \"In that sense, the EU budget is hopelessly out of date and should be reformed to focus on helping Europe compete in an increasingly knowledge intensive global economy.\" But Mr Booth said the \"free movement of people across the EU, which offers the ability to exchange ideas and recruit from a wide pool of talent, is clearly important to universities\".

        "article": "A group of academics say they have serious concerns about proposals to let private contractors take over some child protection services in England. Professor Ray Jones of Kingston University said child protection was too important to be handled by firms \"driven by the profit motive\".  He said any such move could be destabilising and cause \"chaos\".  Ministers said it was a consultation and local authorities would not be forced to employ outside organisations. Prof Jones, who specialises in social work, was the leading signatory of   by the 37 academics, criticising companies that could be expected to bid for child protection contracts.  We're opening this up to potential chaos\u201d He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that potential bidders such as G4S, Serco and Atos had performed poorly on several high-profile contracts, \"won't be local [and] won't be focused on this as their core business\". He said this meant there would be a \"lack of a strong focus on staying close to children and families\".  \"Child protection is much too important to get it destabilised in this way,\" Prof Jones said.  \"We're opening this up to potential chaos.\" Prof Jones also said contractors would \"not be regulated or registered so they won't be required to be approved organisations\".  The Department for Education rejected this, saying any arrangement would \"be scrutinised by Ofsted as part of their inspection regime in exactly the same way as children's social services are inspected now\". Prof Jones's comments followed a consultation launched by the Department for Education in light of problems dealing with failing children's services in Doncaster and Birmingham in particular. Amanda Kelly, executive director of Impower, a public sector consultancy that has done work outsourced from social service departments, told the BBC the government was \"trying to inject some innovation into a sector where it's needed\".  Some councils are already using external expertise... others have asked us to extend these freedoms\u201d She said a small number of local authorities had been performing badly and there was \"a requirement to do something... quite quickly to address what is a long-term problem that has built up over many years\".   In their letter, the academics said child protection should not be exposed to what they called the \"fickleness and failings\" of private organisations. They wrote: \"England has one of the most successful child protection systems in the world. \"This is based on strong accountability, stability, continuity, good local partnership working across professionals and agencies, and with experienced and committed professionals and leadership. \"The intention that private sector organisations such as G4S, Serco, Atos and others should be able to run child protection services causes considerable concern. \"Their track record elsewhere has hardly been unblemished in providing Olympics security, over-claiming payments for tagging offenders, misreporting on GP out-of hours contracts, and delaying and denying disability benefits.\" Kathy Evans, chief executive of Children England, which represents more than 100 children's charities said: \"What is of most concern here is the function of deciding whether a child is at risk, assessing the family and making recommendations to court, making decisions about how resources will be allocated to children on taxpayers' behalf. \"It's in that process where the profit-motive could really undermine whoever is trying to do that very difficult work.\" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We want to improve the quality and efficiency of children's social care. \"Some councils are already using external expertise to improve their work, while others have asked us to extend these freedoms so that they can look at new, improved ways of delivering services. \"There will be no obligation for councils to take up these freedoms and any that do will still be held accountable by Ofsted. \"We will take into account all responses to the consultation before setting out next steps.\" Prof Jones said a better answer was to provide \"more resources for local councils\".  \"We need stability and continuity at the front line,\" he said.

Mr Rhys Jones later said he  . The ceremony to install the Cardiff-born TV presenter in the top university role was halted less than an hour before it was due to take place on 10 April.

The decision was then referred back to the university council. One member of the court, Prof Brian J Ford, later told BBC Wales members felt \"betrayed\" over the \"grossly embarrassing\" affair. The university council considered the chancellor appointment again at a meeting on Monday, but no announcement on the outcome is expected until Tuesday. A spokesman for the institution has previously said Sir Martin had indicated his willingness to be considered for nomination for a further term.

        "article": "A research project into why girls drop physics after GCSE has been announced by the Institute of Physics (IOP). Specialists will work in 20 schools in England to establish how best to encourage more girls to study physics at A-level. The IOP says girls make up only 20% of students taking physics A-level. IOP president Frances Saunders said study was \"a real opportunity to find the solution to the chronic problem of too few girls studying physics\". Dr Saunders said choosing to drop the subject too early \"seriously limits girls' choice of future careers\". The two-year pilot project will begin in September in schools in Yorkshire, the North-East, Midlands and East of England.  Physics specialists will look at factors that discourage girls from studying A-level in the subject, including attitudes towards physics, teachers' classroom practice, and gender stereotyping across schools as a whole. They will also \"trial a series of intensive interventions\" to overcome these, says the IOP.   Project manager Clare Thomson said girls did just as well as boys in GCSE maths and physics, but only a minority chose to continue the subject beyond the age of 16.  Previous initiatives have succeeded in boosting overall numbers of A-level physics students but the proportion who are girls has stuck at about 20% for 20 years, said Ms Thomson.  \"This gives us an opportunity to try some different ideas. We will look at the whole school culture around gender and gender stereotyping and how that limits choices for both girls and boys - both subject choices and career choices.\" She said the aim was to build girls' confidence and resilience so that the \"hardness\" of the subject \"doesn't become a barrier\".  \"We will be working with girls directly and helping them to think that physics is a subject that they can do and be good at.\" The researchers will also work with physics teachers on issues such as whether single or mixed groups work best in terms of building girls' confidence in the subject. The Department for Education has announced funding for the project as part of the  , which already works in 400 schools to boost overall numbers taking the subject.  Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: \"The Institute of Physics has found that the difference between pupils falling in or out of love with physics is the teaching they receive.  \"Inspirational teaching, challenging stereotypes and getting young people excited about the huge potential of science is the best way to get more pupils studying it and going on to enjoy the higher wages these skills command.\"  David Hermitt, head teacher of a specialist engineering academy in Cheshire, said ambitious girls aiming at medicine as a career often dropped physics at A-level because they deemed biology and chemistry more important for their university applications.  Mr Hermitt, head of Congleton High School, said he wanted to encourage more of his female students to continue with physics at A-level and consider engineering as a career as an alternative.   He added that it was important for schools to have female physics teachers as role models.  The IOP is also running a similar project in six Thames Valley schools with funding from the Drayson Foundation.   ",

        "article": "For a generation of European students, the Erasmus programme has been synonymous with having a good time while studying in another country.  Three million students have taken part in this exchange visit project over 27 years. There were serious underlying principles about life skills, employability and getting a taste of another culture.  But it also had an optimistic international feel-good factor. This European Union project was where higher education met overseas travel and the spirit of Eurovision. There has even been a spin-off movie about the social experience of Erasmus students house-sharing in Barcelona. It's a rom-com with lessons. But times have changed. And so has Erasmus, which is now rebranded as Erasmus+. The youthful idealism is being replaced with something with a harder edge and a more clearly defined strategic purpose.  Youth unemployment and the lack of job skills are now the more sober background. The relaunched Erasmus will be expected to play a much bigger role in improving workplace skills. If the image of Erasmus has been students spending time in picturesque European university towns, it is now also about apprentices from southern Europe finding about workplace training in the engineering centres of Austria and Germany. While most European Union budgets have been cut, Erasmus+ has received a 40% increase, with over 14bn euros (\u00a312bn) over seven years. It will be expected to accelerate the numbers it reaches, with a target of four million young people. A cluster of other education and training projects are also being brought under the Erasmus brand. The European Commissioner responsible for the project, Androulla Vassiliou, has been spreading the message of the new-look Erasmus. Last week it was launched in Berlin, this week the roadshow was in London. The urgent problem that Erasmus+ will be expected to help tackle is the economic and social damage of having 26 million people unemployed across the European Union, with six million of them young people. \"It is the biggest challenge that Europe faces,\" she says. But Ms Vassiliou spoke of the \"paradox we face in Europe\" in the mismatch between young people's skills and the jobs available. At the same time that unemployment is high, there are two million job vacancies across the European Union where employers cannot find people with the right skills. The underlying problem is the lack of good vocational education - and she wants countries with serious problems with youth unemployment, such as Spain and Greece, to learn from more successful training systems operating elsewhere within the EU. \"We know that in countries where they have high-quality vocational skills and training, like Germany and Austria, their youth unemployment is very low. \"We are encouraging partnerships between countries that have a good system of vocational training with countries that don't have it, in order to learn from each other.\" Ms Vassiliou said she wanted to encourage cross-border approaches to some of the root causes of young people being unable to find work - such as poor reading skills, a lack of foreign languages and dropping out of school at too early an age. In the UK, the Erasmus+ project will provide funding of almost a billion euros (\u00a3820m) over seven years, with the aim of reaching about a quarter of a million students. Within the UK, Erasmus+ will be delivered by the British Council. Skills Minister Matthew Hancock welcomed the expanded remit and said it was \"absolutely realistic\" to envisage exchange visits for vocational learners as well as university students. \"The idea of spending part of your apprenticeship overseas in countries which have brilliant apprenticeship programmes is a very attractive one,\" he said. Mr Hancock also backed the more focused approach of the revamped Erasmus. \"Reform is about making sure where European money is spent it's spent properly.\" Erasmus+ will still have an important role for higher education and schools. The funding will support exchanges of two million students and 800,000 lecturers, teachers and education staff. There will also be support for exchanges with countries outside the European Union. Universities will be backed to form 150 international Knowledge Alliances, where institutions and businesses from different countries will work together on promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. The role of the European Union is to support the increasingly important international dimension of education, says Ms Vassiliou. \"The world of education is globalising and facing a set of common challenges that demand co-operation, the cross-border transfer of innovation and the sharing of ideas,\" she said at the launch event in London. And she wanted the exchanges between students from different countries to continue \"opening minds and changing lives\". ",

        "article": "Super-heads could take over running clusters of schools in Birmingham, as the government considers its response to allegations of extremism. It would mean some schools being taken from council control and being converted to academies. There are four investigations examining \"Trojan Horse\" claims that groups of hardline Muslims have been trying to take over schools in the city. A government source says that no options have been ruled in or out. The trust which runs Park View, one of the schools caught up in the claims, issued a statement on Thursday dismissing allegations of extremism as false. The education watchdog Ofsted and the Department for Education are expected to deliver reports in June on the next steps for schools which have faced these allegations. It is understood that ministers have approached heads of successful schools and academy trusts about taking over other schools where there have been concerns. This could include taking schools away from local authority control, converting them into academies - directly funded by central government - and putting them under the leadership of high-achieving head teachers. Groups of outstanding schools like the Perry Beeches chain in Birmingham may have a role. As some of the schools caught up in the Trojan Horse claims are already academies, it could mean schools being reassigned to other academy trusts. Birmingham City Council said it would not be appropriate to comment on any \"proposed action\" until Ofsted's inspection reports had been published. \"We can say, however, that we are in regular contact with DfE and this action has not been discussed with us,\" said a council spokesperson. The GMB union warned: \"It is absolutely disgusting that the government is pre-empting the outcome of the investigation into these schools and planning to sell these schools on to their friends in the academy chains.\" Before the Trojan Horse claims, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had spoken publicly of his belief that the local authority might need to be broken up. Birmingham is the biggest local authority in England - and it is believed that private soundings have shown it would be difficult to find a private sector contractor willing or able to take on the running of such a wide range of services. But another option would be for some or all of the council's education and children's services to be hived off to an independent trust. This model has been used before where central government believed there was a need for radical intervention - such as in Hackney in London. Birmingham City Council's chief executive, Mark Rogers, was recorded at a meeting with school representatives last week, where he warned of a \"firestorm\" when the Ofsted reports were published, and telling his audience to prepare for \"significant structural changes\" within the education department. The investigations into extremism in Birmingham schools had been sparked by an anonymous and unverified letter claiming that there was a \"Trojan Horse\" conspiracy by a group wanting to impose a more hardline Muslim agenda on schools in the city. This included claims that head teachers were being replaced with staff who were more likely to be sympathetic to these religious beliefs. The authenticity of the letter has been disputed, but the National Association of Head Teachers says there seem to have been \"concerted efforts\" to take over six schools in Birmingham. However, claims of extremism have been categorically denied by Tahir Alam, chairman of governors at Park View School. And the Park View Educational Trust issued a statement arguing that the response to the letter had created a climate which encouraged false allegations. The claims about religious extremism were driven by \"the settling of political scores\" and disgruntled former staff, the trust argues. \"Our assemblies, or acts of worship, are used to focus on the spiritual and moral development of pupils and are relevant to their school and home lives,\" said the statement from Park View. \"This includes looking at the common values of kindness, mercy and forgiveness and talking to students about studying hard, and being a good friend.\" Or send us your experiences using the form below.

        "article": "The exam revision season is approaching. It's when students want as much information as possible at their fingertips. So how about if you could touch a screen and download all the lesson materials you need? Not just broadly relevant, generic materials, but the actual classes you've studied, video and text, put together specifically by your own teachers.  These are the equivalent of digital textbooks supporting lessons for each subject, including the days missed or forgotten. And for good measure, how about if every student in the school could look at the materials on their own individual iPad? This isn't a \"classroom of the future\" experiment or a Silicon Valley sales pitch, it's a school in Cambridge. The Stephen Perse Foundation school is building a pathway that others could soon follow. It's clever and digital, but also practical and easily shared. Teachers at the independent school are making their own online library of lessons and course materials for GCSE, A-levels and International Baccalaureates. These are interactive resources, with video links and lesson notes, customised for the specific needs and speeds of their classes. There are extension exercises and links to further reading and ideas. They are made to share on iTunes U, the academic version of Apple's iTunes download service, so pupils can access them at school or at home or anywhere else. There has been a huge amount of hype about online university courses - the so-called Moocs (massive online open courses). But here in this ancient university city, it's a school that is really putting the idea of online courses into practice. In two years' time we may have to make decisions about whether we have printed textbooks\u201d It still requires excellent teachers - to make them and to make sense of them - but you can see the far-reaching possibilities of creating the exam course equivalent of a box set of a TV series. The pioneering and innovative principal of this high-achieving school is Tricia Kelleher. She emphasises that such online courses depend on the quality and the skill of the teacher, it's not a plug-and-play education.  \"The credibility of online learning depends on the teachers who have made the materials,\" she says. \"An iPad on its own isn't inspiring, it's the way it's used that's inspiring.\" \"Education should be a mixed economy, there should be technology, but it is only there to support what a living, breathing teacher is doing.\" But she sees how online technology is about to change the traditional textbook. \"You're getting beyond the one-size-fits-all textbook. As a resource, I can't see it being bettered. You might buy a textbook, but half of it might not be relevant to your school.\" These digital versions can be updated by teachers, customised to specific classes and connected to the latest events. These instant updates will be immediately live on the pupils' iPads. \"In two years' time we may have to make decisions about whether we have printed textbooks,\" says Ms Kelleher. Simon Armitage, a senior teacher at the school, says this switch to digital allows staff to \"cherry pick from a world of resources\".  \"This used to be just about books, now it is way more than this. iTunes U is the wrapper. It is not changing what many great teachers have been doing, but it is changing how they are doing it and how easily they are able to do it.\" Ms Kelleher is also keenly aware that her pupils are now living in a digital world - whether it's social networking or getting information from Google - and that technology cannot be kept outside the school gate. \"A school has to accept this is the world we live in,\" she says. The challenge is to give young people the skills to navigate it. So she says that a key skill in the future will be teaching pupils how to evaluate all the instantly available information. \"A school has to be about critical thinking, it's never been more important. There's a level of passivity with a screen.\" But there is another big difference with online courses. They might be created for one school or university, but if they're any good, they can be shared. It's the basic principle behind the Moocs. It uses technology to extend the reach of education beyond an individual classroom to anywhere else in the world. The Stephen Perse Foundation gets exceptionally good exam results - among the highest in the world for the International Baccalaureate.  And the school is planning to make its online materials free online. This school happens to use iPads and iTunes U, but there are many other Mooc-type platforms, and it raises the prospect of many more great schools publishing their own digital materials. Such online resources are also set to be shared within groups of schools. The United Learning education charity, which runs more than 40 schools across England, is looking at how the expertise of individual teachers can be shared within a network of schools. The group's director of technology, Dominic Norrish, says that even though everyone can remember a brilliant teacher in their own school, such inspirational teachers can only reach a limited number of pupils. If you're not in their classroom, you don't benefit from their teaching. He suggests that online learning, with a mix of video and live teaching, could be a way of getting more from the best staff, particularly in subjects where there can be a shortage of specialists. It shouldn't depend on \"accidents of geography\", he says. In the future, it should be possible for \"students in Bournemouth to play an active part in lessons taking place in Carlisle\". This is also going to be an international market. Alison, a free online course provider which already has three million registered students around the world, is planning to launch video tutorial materials specifically made for GCSE and A-level maths. This Irish-based online education service, the biggest Mooc outside the United States, provides materials across national boundaries - and such globalisation seems ever more likely. There is clearly a huge demand for such online learning. The iTunes U service reached a billion downloads last year, with free course material on offer from more than 2,400 universities, colleges and schools. It's pumping out courses and information at an unprecedented rate. And projects such as the Stephen Perse Foundation will see more and more schools putting their self-authored materials on to these digital libraries, available to a global audience. They might even make it into the academic downloads chart. After all, where else would you have a top 10 where the most popular performers are courses from Oxford, UCLA, Yale and Stanford? ",

        "article": "A campaign to improve the quality and number of school governors has been launched by a group of school leaders, employers and governors' organisations. The Inspiring Governors Alliance wants to encourage more \"high-calibre people\" to volunteer. A report found many schools in England - often in deprived areas - struggle to recruit governors, while bodies did not always represent the \"wider community\".  Education Secretary Michael Gove said the \"school system is in their hands.\" The recruitment drive is supported by the ASCL and NAHT head teachers' organisations, the National Governors' Association, the CBI employers group and the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. There are 350,000 governors in England - volunteers who have a major role in overseeing \u00a346bn of school spending. The Inspiring Governors Alliance says that the expertise provided by governors to the school system has the value of \u00a31bn per year. But the accompanying report says that recruiting can be difficult in the disadvantaged areas where effective governors are most needed. Governors in England are responsible for holding schools to account for their academic performance, overseeing school finances and ensuring the ethos and \"strategic direction\". However, the role of governors has been put under scrutiny with the so-called \"Trojan Horse\" allegations in Birmingham, where there are claims that hardline Muslim groups have sought to gain influence over school governing bodies. Birmingham City Council has frozen the recruitment of governors while the allegations are investigated. There have also been questions about governors' scrutiny of spending in academy chains. A study from Prof Chris James at the University of Bath, published as part of the Inspiring Governors project, provides the biggest profile of the current state of school governing bodies, based on a survey of about 7,700 governors in all types of state school. The study shows that governors are overwhelmingly likely to be white - 96% - with little difference between wealthy and poor areas or between urban and rural schools. They are also likely to be middle class. A large majority of governors are in professional or managerial jobs - and that those who are retired are likely to have been in such professional careers. About a third of governors are not working, usually because they are retired. This means that governing bodies are often not representative of the local communities served by a school - and this could be a weakness when appointing a head teacher.  The report says governing bodies can have problems recruiting new members - with many saying there were shortages of people from the \"wider community\" wanting to become governors, as well as shortages of parent and teacher governors. To encourage more people to come forward, governors say that there needs to be a clearer public recognition of their value. \"Employers have a role too in making it easier for their employees to be involved. What is very clear from our research is that recruiting governors can be very difficult and we need more volunteers with the right qualities,\" says Prof James. About a quarter of governors who had jobs said they were allowed to take paid time off - with one in 20 not allowed any time off by their employers. The typical amount of time spent on school governance was between four and 16 hours per month. Introducing the report, Nick Chambers, director of the Education and Employers Taskforce, said it acknowledged \"the work of hundreds of thousands of individuals who volunteer their time, free of charge, to provide leadership and accountability within our schools\". He said there should now be \"a new call to action to make it as easy as possible for all schools to find people, willing and able, to strengthen governing bodies across the country\". \"There has never been a more important time to be a governor,\" said Mr Gove. The education secretary has previously criticised governors who were \"local worthies who see being a governor as a badge of status not a job of work\". Neil Carberry, the CBI's director for employment and skills, said: \"There's no better or more strategic way for business to support and influence the education system and our future workforce than through school governance.\" ",

        "article": "The maths skills of teenagers in parts of the deep south of the United States are worse than in countries such as Turkey and barely above countries such as Chile and Mexico. An international study of maths ability in the US shows how individual states would have performed if they were ranked against other countries, using the OECD's Pisa results as a benchmark. The study also shows that  . This analysis, from academics at Harvard and Stanford in the US and Munich University in Germany, punctures the idea that middle-class US pupils are high achievers. Southern states Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are among the weakest performers, with results similar to developing countries such as Kazakhstan and Thailand. West Virginia is also among the group of lowest performers, where maths levels are far below western European countries or high-performing Asian education systems in South Korea or Singapore. The US has been a mediocre performer in international education tests, based on average performance across the country, but this study shows how this average conceals a remarkably wide range of successes and failures. There is a band of high achieving states across the north of the US, where maths results would be as good as many successful European and Asian countries. If Massachusetts had been considered as a separate entity it would have been the seventh best at maths in the world.  Minnesota, Vermont, New Jersey and Montana are all high performers. But there is a long tail of underachievement that dips well below the levels of secondary school pupils in wealthier western European countries. It dips into levels closer to the developing world. New York and California are similar in ability to countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, well below the averages for the US and OECD industrialised countries. There are 23 US states which would be ranked below 30th place in an international ranking of 34 OECD countries at maths. The study also overturns the idea that middle-class children in the US are as good as their international counterparts. It shows that in the US, as in other countries, children from better educated, wealthier families will achieve better results than poorer children. Among children of parents with a low level of education, only 17% were proficient in maths, compared with 43% of children from well-educated families. But this standard of maths among well-educated families in US is well below their counterparts in other countries. In Poland, 71% of children from well-educated families were likely to be proficient in maths. In Germany, 64% of better-off children were proficient at maths and 55% in France. There is a denial phenomenon\u201d Even such a poor performance was unlikely to set off alarm bells, said Paul Peterson, report co-author and professor of government at Harvard University and director of the Program on Education Policy and Governance at the Harvard Kennedy School. \"There is a denial phenomenon,\" says Prof Peterson. He said the tendency to make internal comparisons between different groups within the US had shielded the country from recognising how much they are being overtaken by international rivals. \"The American public has been trained to think about white versus minority, urban versus suburban, rich versus poor,\" he said. The outcome was a misleading sense of complacency about middle-class education, which always appeared to be ahead, he said. Report authors, Prof Peterson, Eric Hanushek at Stanford University and Ludger Woessmann at the University of Munich, wrote in Education Next magazine: \"Lacking good information, it has been easy even for sophisticated Americans to be seduced by apologists who would have the public believe the problems are simply those of poor kids in central city schools. \" \"Our results point in quite the opposite direction,\" . The underachievement in some southern states was a reflection of deep-rooted historical divides and disadvantages, Prof Peterson said, such as slavery and segregation. But the study raises questions about how other southern states can buck the trend, such as Texas. Among the children of poorly educated families, Texas is a spectacularly strong performer, equivalent to sixth place in the OECD rankings, just behind Finland.  California raised another set of negative questions, said Prof Peterson, with a very low performance. \"California was historically thought to have a good education system, but it's plunged since the 1970s,\" he said. It has an economy big enough to match many OECD countries, but in education comparisons it would be a lightweight, its maths performance weaker than in almost any other industrialised country. \"It's where the rubber hits the road,\" said Prof Peterson.   There were long-term implications from all this, he said. Industries were concentrating around areas with successful education systems. And success in education was linked to healthier and wealthier lives for individuals. Rebecca Winthrop, director for the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, said the findings would \"raise eyebrows\". In particular, she thought it would be a wake-up call for well-educated parents who thought that worries about education were a problem for \"other people's children\". But she said it was important to remember the great size of the country - and that even getting down to state level there were still huge underlying disparities and inequalities. \"California is in itself a huge place,\" she said. And any aggregate results are going to hide the gulf between schools serving the Silicon Valley super rich and the migrant poor. Andreas Schleicher, responsible for the OECD's Pisa tests, said this study was a challenge to middle-class households who thought that debates about school standards did not apply to them. \"The general perception has typically been that this is mainly a concern around poor schools in poor neighbourhoods and so middle-class families have often not been particularly engaged in this,\" he said. In the short term, he said, the US economy would be insulated against this underachievement because it still had a \"strong skill base, simply because it was the first economy investing in universal education in the 1960s, and those people still make up a large part of the workforce\". But this legacy would not last forever.  \"As time goes by, skill gaps will become increasingly apparent,\" he said. The report authors conclude that as well as focusing on the gap between rich and poor, the US needs to pay more attention to the rear lights of their international rivals as they race away ahead of them. 1.

        "article": "The abduction by Boko Haram of schoolgirls has focused attention on the threat to education in north-eastern Nigeria.  What's it like to keep teaching during a state of emergency? The president of a university and group of schools describes the urgent need to protect education. \"I need to leave early today,\" said the imam. We were in an urgent meeting called to deal with the increasing violence in our region. \"I have to pick up my girls from your tutoring programme.\" I live in north-eastern Nigeria. The emergency is the terrorism of the Boko Haram whose recent kidnapping of girl students with the threat to sell them into slavery has rocked the world.  The man worried about his daughters, our local imam, now feared being late picking up his own girls from our after-school English and maths programme. In the two states north of us, nearly 300 girls have been kidnapped.  But the international media and the world are missing other perspectives. First, this level of violence and other atrocities has been going on for over a year. Mothers, fathers, and children have been murdered, the survivors living in terror and despair.  Recently I went with a peace initiative established by our university to deal with the increasing violence, to take relief supplies north to Nigerians displaced by the rampage. Women told us how their sons and husbands had been murdered by Boko Haram, their villages burned to the ground.  How would their orphaned children survive? The peace project, the Adamawa Peace Initiative (API), is an interfaith attempt to reduce violence and build peace in Adamawa state, one of the three states under emergency rule, where thousands of displaced people are now living as refugees. The second thing missing from the raging international discussion is that, at least in our own community and the communities we serve with our literacy projects, all families want education - for their girls and their boys. We represent western education in the north-eastern part of Nigeria. The American University of Nigeria, which opened in 2005, was founded by the country's former vice-president, Atiku Abubakar, who had American Peace corps teachers as a young man and learned the value of an American education. As well as a university, there is a nursery, primary and secondary school. It is based in Yola, capital of Adamawa state. It is easy to imagine from press reports that all is violence and chaos in my region. It is not. We take precautions, of course. We obey the curfew. Our university has hired and trained its own security force of more than 500 women and men. The guards can get an education too if they want - and they look after two campuses, the schools and housing units. But just this weekend we held our annual graduation ceremony attended by over 4,000 of people from all over the world, with the speaker, John Simon, a former US ambassador to the African Union and White House staffer. Just as usual.  The valedictorian, Lotana Nwosu, and class speaker, Odera Okakpu, were women. They spoke of how their university experience had showed them the challenges facing Nigeria and how they could begin to tackle the country's problems. We also dedicated our new state-of-the-art library, which has been internationally recognised for its pioneering efforts to create the finest e-library in Africa. Life goes on.  For us, security comes from not only our security force, but our development and peace programmes in our community. Recently, I had an eye-opening experience at one our projects, which teaches local women entrepreneurship skills to generate some income here in one of the poorest places on earth. I met with about 80 women in the program, held in a school without a roof and with only a dirt floor. How is your entrepreneurship training going; what are you learning, I asked. Their answer surprised me. They had decided against entrepreneurship training, they said.   They wanted to learn English, Nigeria's official language, so that they could read to their children. In modern education, they knew, lay the only hope for the future.  Last month the Adamawa Peace Initiative held an open meeting on our campus with about 50 members of the \"Peace through Sports Initiative.\" These are youth with some education but no jobs.  About half have dropped out of secondary or high school and over 10% have not completed primary (or elementary) school.  None are employed. These are just the type of vulnerable youth so often targeted to join Boko Haram and other terrorist groups. To get them involved and invested in the community, the university's Peace Council has created 32 football and volleyball teams where these young men and women, boys and girls, play in tournaments year round on the university campus. Many of the teams are called \"unity teams\", teams deliberately constructed to have youths of both faiths and different ethnic groups training and playing with each other.  The sports project gives the unemployed youth some direction and a constructive outlet for their energy, while the Adamawa Peace Initiative requires that they go through a peace curriculum, focused on building understanding and tolerance. At the meeting these young people asked pointed and thoughtful questions: \"Nothing can move forward in society without peace - how can we contribute?\" asked Daniel.  A very soft-spoken young man asked the local bishop, Peter Makanto and the imam, Dauda Bello (both members of the Adamawa Peace Initiative) to spread their message of inter-faith harmony, but louder. Young Mohammed asked me how he could get access to our educational programmes. A survey of male and female members of our Peace Through Sports Initiative is instructive - education was the top priority. Educational levels, especially in the north where we are located, are very low. In Adamawa state, where the university is based, recent data shows that over 75% of the youth are illiterate. Maternal mortality rates are among the highest in the world, educational attainment the lowest. Primary school teachers have not been paid in 18 months.  The youths here face a future where they see little hope of ever having a job in a region that has no reliable electricity; no reliable safe running water, perched on the southern edge of the advancing Sahara.  Nigeria is one of the fastest growing countries in the world. Its population doubles every 25-30 years.  Already Africa's most populous country, it will be the third largest country in the world in about 30 years. There is a whole generation of young Nigerians without a future, and they are almost beyond our reach. If we can't find a way to help them, violence bred of despair and hopelessness will become their answer and outlet. The youth in Nigeria are beginning to speak - some with violence. They attract attention. But others are also speaking. The question is, is anyone listening to this plea for western education, for training, for reform, for help? ",
