        "article": "    There is a standard protocol now when watching Mo Farah in big races: let him pick his way through the early skirmishes, wait for him to seize the lead just before the bell and then roar him home as the world's best distance runners flap and flutter in his slipstream.\n     Six times in the last two and a half years Farah has won gold in that fashion, from Korea to Moscow and, most memorably of all, in Stratford's Olympic Stadium. Which will make it all the more unsettling for some to learn that, on his return to the capital for \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     he will be running as a novice.\n     You can forecast a man's 5,000m chances in big championships on his performance in the heats. You can gauge his 10,000m hopes on precedent and form. \n     The marathon? A long, purgatorial run into virgin territory. \n     There is no precedent. There is no science to predict what might happen. Farah has run 26.2 miles in training. But he has never covered it at race pace, on asphalt, with rivals pushing and breaking, the course twisting and climbing, emergency sirens wailing from muscle, joint and lung.\n      \n    Dennis Kimetto (Ken) - Berlin 2012 \n      \n    Ayele Abshero (Eth) -  Dubai 2012 \n      \n    Tsegaye Mekonnen (Eth) - Dubai 2014 \n      \n    Lelisa Desisa (Eth) - Dubai 2013 \n      \n    Bernard Koech (Ken) - Dubai 2013 \n      \n    Kenenisa Bekele (Eth, above) - Paris 2014 \n     And that, for a nation grown accustomed to his peerless track triumphs, may take some getting used to.\n     \"It's inevitable with everything Mo has achieved so far that people are going to expect that he wins it,\" says Paula Radcliffe, the \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and Farah's friend and advisor since his schooldays in Hounslow.\n     \"He could have a really good run and not win it. It doesn't mean he's run badly, but trying to convey that to other people is difficult because he has done so much. He has achieved so much that people expect every time he steps out he's going to win.\"\n     Last weekend the only other man to pull off the world and Olympic distance double-double, Kenenisa Bekele, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     in Paris.\n     That was in a race where he was untroubled by rivals or their tactics. In contrast to that tailor-made itinerary, Farah has chosen to make his own bow on the most public stage of all, against the best field London has ever assembled.\n     There is \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     There is world-record holder Wilson Kipsang, and course record holder Emmanuel Mutai, and Olympic and world champion Stephen Kiprotich. There will be no hiding place, no respite, no easy ride. \n Farah has a close affinity with the London Marathon\r\n       Farah understands the dimensions of his task. Ever since he moved from student digs in St Mary's in Twickenham to a shared house with Kenya's distance elite back in 2004, spending his evenings watching old VHS cassettes of track greats and marathon classics, he has been the most willing student of his specialised subject.\n     But even as his body language at his pre-race media interviews appeared bashful - half-sentences, shy grins, lean limbs hidden under baggy grey tracksuit bottoms and an over-sized white T-shirt - his mood was bullish.\n     \"I've gone straight in the deep end, but that's what champions do. London is by far the toughest field anyone has seen. It makes me more of a champion for going out there and going straight in.\"\n     Farah's ascent to the elite is intimately entwined with this race. Three times as a teenager he won the mini-marathon, the three-mile race for kids aged from 11-17 that precedes the main event at its Mall finish; after leaving school in 2001, it was a London Marathon scholarship that paid for him to join the newly established endurance performance centre at St Mary's rather than join the army, as he feared he would have to.\n     In making his debut this year he is being richly rewarded. Yet he is also paying something back, revitalising interest in the elite side of the race for a public that haven't been drawn to it with as much curiosity since Radcliffe's record-breaking deeds a decade ago. \n     Outside of hardcore athletics fans, most people have grown to think of the London Marathon as friends and fancy dress rather than unmissable sporting drama.\n     The uncertainty about his performance only multiplies the fascination. How fast can he go? What would constitute success?\n      \n     Emmanuel Mutai (Ken) - 2011\n      \n     Wilson Kipsang (Ken) - 2012\n      \n     Sammy Wanjiru (Ken) - 2009\n      \n     Martin Lel (Ken) - 2008\n      \n     Tsegaye Kebede (Eth) - 2010\n     It is notoriously difficult to compare marathons run on different days on different courses, so Bekele's two hours, five minutes and three seconds in Paris may provide only limited guidance; while it is worth noting that the Ethiopian's bests over 5,000m and 10,000m are 16 and 29 seconds faster than Farah's, those PBs were set a long time ago, and the pair were only separated by hundredths of a second over the half-marathon distance of the Great North Run last September.\n     The man whose distance records Bekele beat, Haile Gebrselassie, ran 2:06:35 on his own London debut in 2002, at the time the fastest debut in history. His great track rival Paul Tergat had clocked 2.08:15 in London the year before. \n     Neither do those two provide a perfect prediction for Farah this Sunday, but they do offer context: Farah could run brilliantly, beat the great Haile's debut and yet still finish fourth.\n     What gives those close to him such confidence - there were whispers this week that he is in shape to dip under 2:05 with benevolent weather and a little luck - is that he comes to London off the same formula that has made him the preeminent track runner of his era.\n     Farah is no longer the callow, talented yet capricious kid who struggled to convert his ability into major medals in the early part of his career. He is in supreme physical shape, the product of his usual winter at altitude in Iten, Kenya, with the solid self-belief of a multiple champion to match.\n     In coach Alberto Salazar he has a man who knows more about marathon training than anyone else in the world. Just as importantly, Farah, after the unparalleled success the pair have enjoyed together since 2011, takes confidence in everything he advises.\n     While this is 40,000 steps into the unknown, it is no wild punt. With no World Championships or Olympics this year, Farah can test himself over the ultimate challenge without jeopardising his track status or future goals.\n     Wilson Kipsang (Ken) \n     \n    - Berlin, 2013\n     Patrick Makau (Ken) \n     \n     - Berlin, 2011\n     Dennis Kimetto (Ken) \n     \n     - Chicago, 2013\n     Emmanuel Mutai (Ken) \n     \n     - Chicago, 2013\n     Haile Gebrselassie (Eth)\n     \n     - Berlin, 2008\n     If it works, he may think about a 10,000m/marathon double at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, just as Salazar hinted to me that he would in the aftermath of 2012. If it fails, he can return to the track in time to keep his speed over the shorter stuff. \n     \"With a marathon, it is about racing, to see how you cope with the distance and how your body copes with it,\" says Radcliffe, who has no fears that Farah's springy track style might not convert to the heavy demands of the road.\n     \"It is refreshing for him to have a new and different challenge. He'll probably still be successful on the track, if not more successful than he has been, with the marathon training behind him, but this gives him a chance to do something a little bit different. Yes, it's challenging, but I think he will be relishing the fact that it is a new stimulus for him.\"\n     Gebrselassie will be back on London's streets on Sunday as the elite field's pacemaker, driving them along at close to record pace over the first 30km (18.5 miles). Farah, who will run without a watch (\"I'll just go with the feeling\"), will want to conserve as much energy as he can in that time, for once letting other athletes dictate, staying safe until at least 18 miles and the multiple assaults that will surely follow.\n     \"In the marathon you really do have to run your own race,\" says Radcliffe, 11 years on from setting her own unsurpassed world record of 2:15.25 on the same course. \n     \"You have to cover moves and be aware of what others are doing, but you also have to do what's right for your body and do what suits you best. And that's tricky when you haven't run one before.\"\n     Farah already has the British records at 1500m, 5,000m and 10,000m. The 29-year-old marathon mark of Steve Jones (2:07:13) is realistically in sight this weekend. Beyond that the boundaries are less certain. London will feel a foreign land.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Mo Farah ready for London Marathon debut ",

I couldn't be happier with him.\"\n     The winner runs in the same Prince Khalid Abdullah colours as the legendary Frankel, who also won the Greenham before a stunning victory in Newmarket's 2,000 Guineas, one of 14 wins in an unbeaten career. \n ",

Interview - Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara     The game initially had to accept second billing, since the competition was between the two sets of supporters and their goading of each other. The noise spilled from the Ibrox stands as if oblivious to events on the pitch.\n     There was soon a hectic urgency to the play, though, and composure was an early victim of the heightened atmosphere. There were pent-up emotions to be released, and the quality of the game suffered from the raucous surroundings.\n     There was excitement and zeal as the two sets of players hared around the Ibrox pitch, but not enough self-control to bring some poise to the proceedings. \n     Rangers had the most cause to rue that lack of restraint, since they should have opened the scoring when Dean Shiels was sent through on goal. The forward hurried his finish, though, and scuffed the ball wide.\n     It became a galling miss for Rangers, because minutes later a hopeful Gavin Gunning header sent Armstrong clear. \n     Nadir Ciftci was returning from an offside position but was deemed not to be interfering with play and Armstrong took advantage of the confusion to clip a shot past Simonsen that kissed a post before nestling in the net. \n     A pattern was established, since Rangers had the better patches of play, but could not influence the outcome.\n Armstrong (left) beat the offside trap to put United ahead\r\n       When Fraser Aird was free in the area, he laid the ball back to Jon Daly, only for the striker to direct a shot rashly over the bar.\n     Moments later, Richard Foster failed to clear his lines and allowed Ryan Gauld to burrow into the Rangers penalty area before shunting into the path of Armstrong. He could not connect cleanly and neither, subsequently, could Mackay-Steven, but the ball looped off Bilel Mohsni, over Simonsen, and into the net.\n     Smith restored some hope for Rangers with a free-kick that squeezed between Radoslaw Cierzniak and the base of his left-hand post. \n     That goal came just before half-time and, athough Rangers continued to enjoy greater possession after the interval, their frailties could not be disguised.\n     Mohsni was often hapless in possession, attacks were intermittent and haphazard in nature, and there was not enough link-up play between the midfield and the forwards.\n     United's midfield struggled to retain possession, and their defence often sat too deep, but their four front players were a constant threat, not least because of the calamities that the Rangers defence were capable of.\n     When Foster broke up one move and passed back to Simonsen, the goalkeeper hesitated before stubbing the ball straight at Ciftci. The striker rounded the stricken goalkeeper and was celebrating even before he rolled the ball into the empty net.\n     Rangers restored something of their reputation with this display, but United were the more clinical side.\n           Match ends, Rangers 1, Dundee United 3.

I will give an interview after the World Cup to explain.\"\n     City, who presented Toure with a cake and tweeted their congratulations, are believed to have no intention of selling the midfielder who has three years left on a contract extension signed in April 2013.\n     Seluk denied that Toure's apparent disappointment with the City hierarchy was a tactic aimed at increasing his earnings after a season in which he scored 24 goals in 49 games.\n     \"People think we did this because we want to change the contract, to make more money,\" Seluk told BBC Sport.\n     \"The contract is OK. For us, the most important is attention from the club to whom Yaya gives a lot.\"\n     France international Zidane, who played for Real Madrid for five seasons and scored \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     has stayed on at the club after retiring, firstly in a role as advisor to president Florentino Perez and then as assistant to current manager Carlo Ancelotti.\n     Toure, who\n    \r\n  \r\n\n     from Barcelona in 2010, was linked with a return to the Catalan giants when Seluk made his initial comments on Tuesday. \n     Toure has said he could be playing for another club next season and added he would \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     after the World Cup in Brazil.\n     Ivory Coast are in Group C alongside Colombia, Greece and Japan.\n ",

        "article": " Ball-by-ball Test Match Special commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, Radio 4 Long Wave, BBC iPlayer Radio app, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app; live text commentary on BBC Sport website and mobiles.     Mahela Jayawardene was only 12 years old when a team-mate lost both his parents in a bomb attack at a bus stop in Colombo.\n     \"I remember him finishing the funeral and everything else and playing a game of cricket two or three weeks later,\" the Sri Lanka batsman recalls.\n     \"That's how we were brought up. The right thing to do was just get your head down and get on with it. \n     \"We went to school every day not knowing whether we would come back because there were bombs going off every other week. We were always thankful that we were alive.\"\n     For Jayawardene and his close friend Kumar Sangakkara, cricket became an escape from the daily horrors of life in a country torn apart by a civil war that raged from 1983 to 2009. \n     The glue in Sri Lanka's middle order for more than 15 years, they have gone on to become two of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket, each scoring more than 10,000 Test runs and setting a record for the highest Test partnership with 624 against South Africa in 2006.\n     But the 36-year-olds are more than just cricketing greats. They are survivors, statesmen - Sangakkara's MCC lecture about corruption in Sri Lankan cricket in 2011 earned him a standing ovation at Lord's - and beacons of hope for a proud, cricket-mad nation devastated by conflict, poverty and the tsunami of 2004.\n     On the eve of their final tour of England, Jayawardene and Sangakkara sat down with BBC Radio 5 live to reflect on their remarkable lives, their incredible achievements and the relationship that makes them such a formidable partnership both on and off the cricket field.\n      \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \n      \n     \"When the war broke out my parents took in lots of our friends and family into our house to try to protect them. As a six-year-old it seemed like fun to have lots of friends staying at my house, but what I didn't understand was the risks my parents were taking at the time.\n     \"Now the war is over, the whole country is looking forward to history never repeating itself. I think everyone fully realises the value of peace and what hardship the whole country went through for 30 years to achieve that.\"\n      \n    \"Cricket has always brought the country together. Even during the war, when Sri Lanka won the 1996 World Cup - both sides celebrated and there was a peace for a few days. Now, people living in Sri Lanka want lasting peace. They want to rebuild the country and make a better place for our next generation.\"\n Sangakkara and Jayawardene leave the field after guiding their team to victory over South Africa in 2004 \r\n        \n      \n     \"I'd heard of Mahela before because his name was known. He was playing for the college first XI from the age of 14 and was always talked about as a person who will walk into the national side when the time was right.\"\n      \n    \"Kumar came quite late to cricket. He came and smashed us and got 100 in that game. When we met we realised there was a really good bond between us, we had similar ideas. But we really started to get to know each other once we started playing for the national team. That's when we started the friendship and it has been great.\"\n      \n      \n    \"Mahela is so natural in the way he plays. He is the one cricketer I know who hasn't changed anything since he was 15. His backlift, movement, style, everything has been the same, whereas I have changed and done so many things differently. But he's also very upstanding, forthright and honest.\n      \n    \"Kumar is much more hard-working than I am. I don't have that much patience but Kumar is very analytical and works really hard at his game. I have learnt a lot from him - we feed off each other very well. It's great to see the commitment and the passion he shows on and off the field. His only flaw is his timekeeping. It is something we have always spoken of - not just me but the entire team. But when he comes in he always gives a good excuse.\"\n The scoreboard in Colombo reflects Sangakkara and Jayawardene's record Test stand\r\n        \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \n      \n     \"At the start we talk cricket, keep each other going through the tough periods and discuss what the bowler is doing. Then, as the innings develops, we have moments where we allow the odd joke to slip in. I enjoy batting with Mahela - the way he plays makes it so much easier to do my thing, because the scoreboard is always ticking over. I'd be trying to play really solid against spin, he'll be down the track lofting a couple, sweeping and reverse sweeping. When the bowler is thinking about him, they sometimes forget about me.\"\n      \n     \"We complement each other really well - Kumar being left-handed and me right-handed probably helps. It's tough for the bowlers to get used to us. Kumar is very solid - he knows the ins and out of a bowler so I get a lot of information from him about what the bowler is trying to do. We feed off each other, get into a rhythm and enjoy batting together.\"\n      \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \n      \n    \"We all thought we were going to die, it was that brutal. We were so lucky to get away from that and survive to tell the story. It's an unfortunate incident and we wish no-one had to go through it, but because we grew up in a war-torn environment it was not a big drama for us. Soon afterwards, we were joking inside the bus about how people reacted, the way some people screamed, got down and were lying on the ground. But at the end of the day you realise how lucky you were.\"\n      \n    \"Because none of the team died we were able to move on quite quickly. We were in the limelight but lots of people have gone through much tougher things and then moved on with life, so why should we be any different?\"\n      \n      \n    \"We spoke about what had happened in the past the night before. We were nervous and said if we lose this we will probably have to hang ourselves. But talking about it helped. In the past we haven't executed certain things properly. We knew we had to keep things simple and back ourselves. Everything came right in that final.\" \n      \n    \"There were times in that tournament when we thought we were in big trouble. Playing New Zealand in the quarter-final with only 119 to defend and against South Africa when they needed fewer than six an over. But different players put their hands up and took responsibility at different times and that worked for us.\"\n Paul Farbrace is mobbed by team-mates after Sri Lanka's World Twenty20 victory in April\r\n        \n      \n     \"I understand the choice Farby made. Whether it was fair [for the England and Wales Cricket Board] to put him in that situation when he was still with us is a different question. It wasn't pleasant, but Farby is a top guy and a fantastic coach. He came back and spoke to the team and everyone understood that from Paul's part it was a tough decision.\" \n      \n     \"Paul was with us for three months. This is a team that was being built for longer than that. We were the number one team in T20s which shows for the last two years we have been playing some really good cricket and a lot of credit should go to the other coaches as well. People make choices, there is nothing wrong with that and we have total respect for Farby as a fantastic coach and a fantastic person. But coaches and players come and go - we move on.\"\n      \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \n      \n    \"There should be a respectful wage for playing cricket, be it first class, or for your country. That is the first step in combating corruption at a very early stage. It's a huge issue, how much is prevalent at the moment and in the past I'm not sure, but the sport depends on the fan. If they question what they see - a bad shot, a no-ball, a wide, it's disastrous for the game.\n     \"There has to be a concerted effort between everyone - players, administrators, the media, spectators, everyone, to try to stop it. International players, or anyone who signs a contract with a national board, should allow the ACSU (Anti-Corruption and Security Unit), or any other investigative body, to have full access to your financial records. I think that will only serve to protect players much more than it does now.\"\n      \n     22 May: \n     \n     The Oval \n     25 May: \n     \n     Chester-le-Street \n     28 May: \n     \n     Old Trafford \n     31 May: \n     \n     Lord's \n     3 June: \n     \n     Edgbaston  \n     12-16 June: \n     \n     Lord's \n     20-24 June: \n     \n    Headingley \n      \n     \"We'll get through the World Cup in 2015 and that will be it for one-dayers I should think. If we can get through that and achieve something for the team, that would be something special.\"\n      \n     \"All formats have been challenging, but Test cricket is the ultimate, it's where you really get pushed and where we have always analysed and set ourselves goals. We want to finish our careers with Test cricket so when that day arrives - I have no idea when - we will assess how we are playing, whether we are enjoying it and then make a call.\"\n ",
