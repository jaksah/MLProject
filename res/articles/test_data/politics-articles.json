They are given guidance as to what they should do for disabled supporters and how many spaces they should provide but this isn't being followed.\n     \"The problem is that the clubs aren't being made to follow it, and neither the FA nor the Premier League has any rules telling them what the minimum standard should be. As a result, the experience of a disabled fan varies greatly from ground to ground.\n     \"Football showed in the wake of Hillsborough and the move to all-seater stadiums that it is capable of drastic action.  However, until clubs are forced to follow these guidelines, wide-scale change in this case appears unlikely.\"\n     Penning said a complete overhaul of grounds was required, \"starting at the very top\".\n     He added: \"The situation is currently woefully inadequate and it is not only wheelchair access that falls short, but access for people with all kinds of impairments.\"\n     Guidelines on how football clubs in the UK should cater for disabled spectators have been in place since 2004. \n     The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     sets out minimum standards that all new grounds have to meet in the provision, location, and quality of facilities for disabled fans. The number of wheelchair spaces a stadium should provide is based on its capacity. \n     Since the implementation of the Equality Act in 2010, and legislation dating back to 1995, it has been illegal for service providers, including football clubs, to treat disabled people less favourably than other customers.\n     Clubs can be ordered to make reasonable adjustments, which can include providing induction loops for those with hearing impairments, audio-description facilities for those with sight impairments and free tickets for carers who accompany disabled fans at games.\n     The Premier League insist they are following the existing regulations, and said: \"The Accessible Stadia Guide sets out agreed standards to be achieved when new grounds are designed or existing grounds rebuilt, however all clubs use those standards to assess existing provisions and guide them on how to make improvements.\n     \"Particular attention is given to achieving stadium management solutions that make the best of the constraints and opportunities inherent in each stadium. This includes working with the fans to arrive at solutions that work for them, and providing special training for stewards and staff to ensure that appropriate assistance is given.\" \n     Joyce Cook, chair of \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     formerly known as the National Association of Disabled Supporters, added: \"The experience of disabled football fans varies across the country. That's not acceptable and it's time all football clubs took their legal obligations seriously.\"\n ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. George Osborne: \"If you are hiding your money offshore, we are coming to get you\" People who hide their money overseas to avoid paying tax face bigger fines and could be jailed more easily under government plans to fight tax evasion. To prosecute at present, tax officials must prove a person holding income offshore has intended to evade tax. But under a new criminal standard officials would only have to show money was taxable and undeclared. Chancellor George Osborne said the changes would mean there was \"no safe haven\" for those evading tax. But Labour said the government was \"failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion\". A consultation will be held to let the public have their say on the plans.  In recent months, the UK has joined other G20 countries in focusing on moves to share information about tax evasion. Now, Mr Osborne says the government will consult on a new criminal standard, harsher fines and increased jail sentences.   At present, offshore tax evaders can be fined twice the amount they owe, and can face criminal prosecution and a possible prison sentence. The government will look at options to increase these penalties, as well as the possibility of financial rewards for whistleblowers who \"help uncover\" untaxed offshore assets. Mr Osborne, who is in Washington DC for the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, said: \"A very important part of our economic plan is that everyone makes a fair contribution.  \"We've already done a lot to crack down on those who don't pay their taxes, now we're introducing a new criminal offence for people who hide their money offshore. \"And the message is very simple - if you're hiding your money offshore, we are coming to get you and the criminal law is going to come and find you.\"  Media requires JavaScript to play. Joe Lynam reports: ''The government wants to tilt the law in favour of the taxman and against secretive millionaires'' Bill Dodwell, head of tax at Deloitte, told the   newspaper the plans were \"horrifying\". \"People should not be put in prison unless you can prove intent,\" he said. \"I'm shocked to find that an offence which could lead to a prison sentence could be decided on a strict-liability basis. \"If this change applies to all evasion cases I think that's unacceptable.\" Ray McCann, tax partner at the law firm Pinsent Masons, said: \"I think what we'd probably be seeing here would be a sort of lower level criminal offence, largely intended to give further encouragement to those who have been evading tax to come forward. \"I would be surprised if we see an increased number of people ending up in the dock and very surprised if any of them were being sent to prison as a result.\" Bob Rothenberg, senior partner at Blick Rothenberg chartered accountants, said he believed the government wanted to frighten people people into owning up, rather than prosecute them. At a time when families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and the deficit is still high, this simply isn't good enough\u201d \"That certainly has been the objective that they've followed up to now, with their various... so-called amnesties,\" he said. \"And I think that they are thinking that they may get a greater number of people coming forward if the threat of criminal prosecution is there.\" Mr McCann added: \"The over-arching difficulty that the Revenue have got is that for about 100 years in this country, we've operated a sort of prodigal son policy. \"So if someone who has got hidden assets decides to come clean and march into the local tax office, put their hands up and confess all, then the public policy put forward by the government in this country was not to prosecute them. \"And that policy is still in place.\" Mr Osborne predicted a tax deal struck between the British and Swiss governments in 2011 would recover about \u00a33bn in previously unpaid taxes in 2013. Figures showed about \u00a3800m was collected last year. Shadow exchequer secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"For all the tough talk, this government is failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion.  \"The amount of uncollected tax rose last year and the chancellor's Swiss tax deal has raised less than a quarter of the revenues promised.  \"At a time when families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and the deficit is still high, this simply isn't good enough.\" BBC business reporter Michelle Fleury said finance leaders from the world's 20 leading economies had been ramping up their fight against tax evasion.  Prime Minister David Cameron made tax a key issue during Britain's presidency of the G8 last year. More than \u00a31.5bn has been recovered from offshore tax evaders over the past two years, according to HM Revenue & Customs. ",

Taking questions at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he said he had \"a deep sense of gratitude to Israel for what they did for my grandmother\".  She survived the Holocaust in Poland before emigrating to the country.  But Mr Miliband said he did not support everything the Israeli government did, criticising the growth in settlements.  Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and formally annexed the area in 1980.  Settlements built there and elsewhere in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this and continues to approve the construction of new settlement homes. Although the Labour leader is of Jewish descent, he told the BBC in 2010 that he does not believe in God. \"I have great respect for those people who do,\" he added.  He paid his respects at the memorial to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, Yad Vashem, and has held meetings with Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  ",

        "article": "The government's \"overblown rhetoric\" on efforts to bring down immigration has contributed to a drop in students doing technology, engineering and maths courses at UK universities, peers say. The Lords Science and Technology Committee said \"inflammatory\" media coverage and people's \"perception of the rules\" were a deterrent. The UK was seen as an \"unwelcoming destination\", it added. But the government said the peers' report lacked \"clear evidence\". It said it was controlling immigration while \"attracting the brightest and the best\". Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wants to get the level of net migration - the difference between the number of people coming in and leaving - down to \"tens of thousands\" by 2015. Since April 2012, foreign students have faced stricter visa regulations, in an effort to cut down on bogus immigrants. But the government stresses that there is no cap on the number of people legitimately coming to the UK to study. The number of students studying science, technology and maths (Stem) subjects - including courses such as medicine, architecture and computer science - fell  by more than 10% from 58,815 in 2010-11 to 52,905 in 2012-13. The committee's report said: \"It was put to us on numerous occasions that it was not the immigration rules as such that were deterring students, but their perception of the rules as a result of overblown rhetoric from ministers and sometimes inflammatory media coverage in the UK and in overseas countries.\" It added: \"The UK was seen as a destination that was unwelcoming to some international students.\" But the report said the evidence \"pointed to difficulties beyond simply those of perception\", with the \"complexity and instability\" of the immigration rules also posing problems. \"The UK's offer to prospective international students remains a good one; it is founded on academic excellence, but it has been diminished by perceived and real barriers so that the overall offer is not as competitive as it needs to be,\" the peers said. Ministers have set out plans to increase the number of international students by up to 20% over the next five years. But the committee said: \"The government maintain that they emphatically welcome international students, unfortunately, elements of policy and perception are working against this admirable aim. \"The view within government that current policies are working well is disconnected from the concerns we repeatedly heard.\" But a Home Office spokesman said: \"We do not accept that the UK's immigration rules are deterring international students and there is no clear evidence in the report to support that argument - where some courses and countries have seen falling numbers, other countries and courses are on the rise.\" He said the UK remained \"the second most popular destination for international higher education students\", with enrolments from \"key markets\", such as China, Malaysia and Hong Kong increasing. The spokesman added: \"The student visa system we inherited was weak and open to widespread abuse. We are controlling immigration while still attracting the brightest and the best - as the published figures show.\" ",

        "article": "Scotch whisky exports stagnated last year, as sales were hit by slowing demand in China and other emerging markets. Figures from the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) showed overseas sales remained flat at \u00a34.3bn by value. In volume terms, exports increased by 2.5% to the equivalent of 1.23 billion bottles.  Scotch whisky performed strongly in the US, Mexico and India but direct exports to China fell by nearly 30% to \u00a351m.  Sales to Taiwan, South Korea and Japan also fell in value, by between 13% and 15%.  We've heard from individual distillers that the fall-off in the Chinese market has a lot to do with official government disapproval of conspicuous consumption, and a crackdown on the culture of business gifts, as they easily cross the line into corruption. It's a challenge that has hit the premium and luxury goods market in quite a big way.  The best performers included the US, which saw exports of Scotch grow 8% on 2012 to a record \u00a3819m.  The US was by far the largest market for whisky by value.  France remained the largest volume market for Scotch.  SWA said sales there rose by 16% as the market recovered following a tax hike on spirits at the start of 2012. India,  which is now Scotch whisky's fourth biggest market by volume, saw the value of whisky sales climb by 12% to \u00a369m.  SWA said it hoped EU-India Free Trade Agreement negotiations would restart following this year's Indian elections, leading to a reduction of the current 150% import tariff. Exports to Brazil and Mexico grew by about 20% - to \u00a399m in Brazil and \u00a3110m in Mexico. A career in the British diplomatic service means David Frost is schooled in the art of choosing his words carefully. The Scotch Whisky Association's chief executive has concerns about independence but he is careful not to overstate them, insisting the vote is a \"decision for the people of Scotland,\" not for its companies. Nonetheless, Mr Frost is seeking \"reassurances\" about the \"risks\" of a 'yes' vote. In the SWA's sunny boardroom in Edinburgh he told me he was concerned that the Scottish government's white paper on independence \"talks of a network of 70 to 90 overseas embassies,\" compared to \"getting on for 200 posts\" in the existing UK diplomatic service. According to the SWA, Scotch whisky represents about 85% of Scottish food and drink exports and about one quarter of the British total, with the industry's exports worth \u00a3135 a second to the UK balance of trade. \"It is important that an independent Scotland gives the same kind of support to the industry and finds ways of doing it that are comparable to what we have now,\" said Mr Frost. \"We're confident this industry is going to succeed whatever the situation after the 18th of September. So we are concerned about the conditions in which we would be operating. We see some risks. We want reassurances. But are we going  to be successful? Yes, you bet.\" In January, spirits producer Diageo reported slowing sales in China and other emerging markets. The company said new rules over gift-giving and spending by Chinese officials dented sales in the country by 66%.  SWA chief executive David Frost said: \"Scotch whisky exports remain strong and the industry's impressive performance makes a major contribution to the UK's trade performance.  \"The unprecedented investment programmes in Scotch whisky by producers show that in the long term they are confident that demand will continue to grow.   \"However, in the short run, there are some economic headwinds. Formal and informal barriers to trade remain.\"  He added: \"We should remember that the industry's success does not come automatically but is based on hard work, investment and careful stewardship.\"  Mr Frost also made a plea for strong government backing for the industry. He said: \"As a former ambassador, I know that the industry also depends on strong political support from government, for example to influence European Union negotiations on our behalf or to press other countries to allow better access to their markets.  \"Both the UK and Scottish governments have played an important role in this so far.\"  He added: \"Whatever the outcome of the Scottish referendum, as an industry exporting to around 200 markets we will continue to need the backing of an effective diplomatic network with the necessary global reach, commercial expertise, and capacity to influence.\"     Overall, Scotch whisky accounts for about 85% of Scottish food and drink exports and nearly a quarter of the British total.

        "article": "UKIP MEPs are untrustworthy and do not stand up for the UK in Europe, David Cameron has said. The PM took direct aim at the party aiming to overtake the Tories in May's Euro elections, saying they seldom \"bothered to vote\" in Brussels. He was speaking at the launch of the Conservative European and English local election campaign. UKIP accused him of \"unfairly insulting millions of voters\", many of whom \"normally back his own party\".  Mr Cameron is seeking to shift the focus from ex-culture secretary Maria Miller's expenses to the EU-wide polls, which are scheduled for 22 May in the UK. In a speech at Manchester airport, he categorised his rivals in \"two extremist camps\", with one professing love for the EU, and the other hate.  Both camps were neglecting the UK's national interest, he argued, re-iterating his pledge to reform the UK's relationship with the EU and hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives win a majority at the 2015 general election.  \"If you want real change in Europe that works for you, for your family, for your business, then the Conservative Party is the only party which can deliver for you,\" Mr Cameron said.   He directed specific criticism at Labour, who he accused of having signed off \"power to Brussels, summit after summit\", and the Lib Dems, who he said were \"absolutely devoted to their dream of ever closer union\".  But his strongest broadside was reserved for UKIP, which campaigns for the UK to leave the EU - and which Mr Cameron has tended to avoid attacking at length in previous campaign speeches.  It's been a difficult week for David Cameron, with Maria Miller resigning because of a row over her expenses. Today's speech was about giving a rallying call six weeks before the European elections. After the Budget the Conservatives seemed to be riding high but the situation surrounding Mrs Miller changed that. We've had head-to-head TV debates between  Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg. Did Mr Cameron make a mistake by not taking part, having seen Mr Farage pick up points in the polls? Today Mr Cameron branded those who say we should leave the EU immediately and those who say the EU should remain unchanged as extremists. May's election will be an interesting indicator as to whether voters are more convinced by Mr Cameron's position or those he dismisses. \"When it comes to standing up for Britain in Europe, is there anyone you would trust less than a group of UKIP MEPs?\" he asked.    \"They talk the talk in Britain, but as soon as they're on that plane to Brussels they change completely. When they do actually bother to vote, they don't stand up for Britain. Indeed their own leader has said they cannot change a thing in Brussels. \"In contrast, we are the only party with a clear plan. Renegotiate. Get the best deal for Britain. Then put the decision to the British people.\"  Responding to the comments, UKIP's director of communications Patrick O'Flynn said: \"By branding anyone who wants to get Britain out of the EU an extremist, David Cameron is not only unfairly insulting millions of UKIP voters but also doing the same to more than half of those who normally back his own party.  \"Anyone who thinks Britain would be better off coming out of the EU and thereby restoring the ability to control its own borders now knows what to do on May 22nd: vote UKIP and cause a political earthquake.  \"Wanting your own country to be self-governing once again is not an extreme position but just plain common sense.\" The clashes come in the wake of a protracted row over Mrs Miller's position.  She resigned as culture secretary after admitting that she had wrongly claimed \u00a35,800 for mortgage interest and apologising for the way she handled an inquiry into her expenses.  The PM had repeatedly defended her. Earlier,   that Chancellor George Osborne led a \"revolt to force Miller out\", but Downing Street sources said this was \"rubbish\".  Mr Cameron said he was \"very sorry\" to accept her resignation on Wednesday morning, telling her she should be \"extremely proud\" of her work in government.  Mrs Miller has been replaced by the Conservative MP for Bromsgrove Sajid Javid, an ally of the chancellor who was promoted from his previous job as Financial Secretary to the Treasury.  The Times said his elevation had been \"taken as evidence of a further strengthening of Mr Osborne's grip on government\" - and that Mr Osborne and Tory election chief Lynton Crosby had warned about the damage being done to the party's electoral prospects by the row.  On Wednesday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited Mrs Miller's Basingstoke constituency, arguing that the row \"reflected very badly on David Cameron\". \"He has completely misjudged the public mood on this,\" Mr Farage said.  Labour leader Ed Miliband also accused Mr Cameron of a \"terrible error of judgement\" in failing to sack her sooner. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Michael Fabricant has also been sacked, from his post as the party's vice-chairman, partly for tweeting that it was \"about time\" Mrs Miller resigned. The active user of the social media site said he had been asked to resign and refused, so was sacked \"over HS2 and my views on a recent cabinet minister\".   ",

        "article": "  \n\t\t \n\t Conservative David Cameron was virtually unknown outside Westminster when he was elected Tory leader in December 2005 at the age of 39. \r\r\nThe Old Etonian had dazzled that year's party conference with his youthful dynamism and charisma, reportedly telling journalists he was the \"heir to Blair\". He has sought to match the former PM by putting the Conservatives at the centre ground of British politics. After the 2010 election he led his party into coalition with the Lib Dems, making tackling the UK economy's deficit its priority. He has faced criticism from some on the right of the party but Mr Cameron has insisted the coalition will see through its full five-year term. Before becoming leader, he was the Conservatives' campaign co-ordinator at the 2005 general election and shadow education secretary. He was special adviser to Home Secretary Michael Howard and Chancellor Norman Lamont in the 1990s before spending seven years as a public relations executive with commercial broadcaster Carlton. In just five years, Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, a contemporary of Mr Cameron, went from political obscurity to the absolute front line of British politics. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter becoming MP for Sheffield Hallam at the 2005 election, he was promoted to Europe spokesman, before moving on to the home affairs role. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWhen Sir Menzies Campbell resigned as leader in 2007, he entered the race to succeed him, in the end narrowly beating Chris Huhne. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe really came to prominence during the televised debates ahead of the general election, being judged in polls to have been the big winner of the first one. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, this appeared to do little to help the Lib Dems when they actually lost seats on 6 May. The party, though, retained enough MPs to become the vital players in the hung parliament. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter taking his party into coalition with the Conservatives - and U-turning on a previous pledge to reject university tuition fees - Mr Clegg saw his personal poll ratings slump, but he has pointed to areas where Lib Dem policies have come into force on taxation and consitutional issues. \r\r\n\r\r\nLike David Cameron, he has insisted the coalition is working in the national interest and will continue for the full parliament. One of David Cameron's closest friends and Conservative allies, George Osborne rose rapidly after becoming MP for Tatton in 2001. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMichael Howard promoted him from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury to shadow chancellor in May 2005, at the age of 34. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Osborne took a key role in the election campaign and even before Mr Cameron became leader the two were being likened to Labour's Blair/Brown duo. The two have emulated them by becoming prime minister and chancellor, but have avoided the spats. \r\r\n\r\r\nSome prominent Conservatives have urged Mr Osborne to do more to promote economic growth. \r\r\n\r\r\nBefore entering Parliament, he was a special adviser in the agriculture department when the Tories were in government and later served as political secretary to William Hague.\r\r\n Theresa May is the second woman to hold the post of Home Secretary. \r\r\n\r\r\nShe was the first woman to become Conservative Party chairman, under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith. \r\r\n\r\r\nShe then took up the culture and family portfolios before being made shadow Commons leader by David Cameron. \r\r\nShe has been a keen advocate of positive action to recruit more women Tories to winnable seats and was a key architect of the \"A list\" of preferred candidates. \r\r\n\r\r\nA passionate moderniser, she famously ruffled feathers when she told Tory activists they were seen as members of the \"nasty party\". \r\r\nIn her role as home secretary, she has overseen widespread changes to the immigration system. \r\r\n\r\r\nMrs May was the shadow work and pensions minister ahead of the election. Since he returned to frontline politics in 2005, Conservative William Hague has become a key adviser to David Cameron, and was seen as de facto deputy party leader. \r\r\nThe foreign secretary has plenty of experience to call upon, having been Tory leader himself from 1997 to 2001 and shadow foreign secretary until the election. \r\r\n\r\r\nA witty and engaging Commons performer who is popular with grassroots Tory members, Mr Hague entered Parliament in 1989 having been special adviser to Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe. He was soon promoted to be a social security minister and in 1995 entered the cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales. \r\r\n\r\r\nIn addition to his duties as shadow foreign secretary, Mr Cameron put Mr Hague in charge of rebuilding the party in the North of England, as chairman of its Northern Board. Vince Cable has had a long journey to reach the front rank of politics, having been a Labour and then an SDP supporter before its merger with the Liberals to become the Liberal Democrats. \r\r\n\r\r\nAn economist by profession, he entered Parliament as MP for Twickenham in 1997 and has gradually built up his powerbase among the Lib Dems. \r\r\nAs the party's deputy leader and Treasury spokesman he saw his stock rising during the credit crunch because of his earlier warnings. \r\r\n\r\r\nWhen he stood in as temporary leader after the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell, he memorably described Gordon Brown as going from \"Stalin to Mr Bean\". \r\r\n\r\r\nHas had a colourful time in government, notably when he was recorded by under cover reporters saying he was at war with Rupert Murdoch's News International. He has been mentioned as a possible future leader of his party. \r\r\n\tSir George Young was replaced as leader of the Commons by Andrew Lansley in the September 2012 reshuffle, but was recalled and given the Chief Whip post a few weeks later following the resignation of Andrew Mitchell.\r\r\n \r\r\n\tSir George, 71 at the time of his return to the cabinet, is one of the most experienced members of the government and has served a number of roles in Conservative administrations since the 1970s. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tHe was elected as MP for Acton in 1974 and became a junior minister in the Thatcher government in 1979. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tIn 1994 he became Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and was promoted a year later to transport secretary. Switching seats to North West Hampshire in 1997, he was given the shadow Commons leader's job in the Tory opposition the same year.\r\r\n \r\r\n\tFrom 2001-09 he served as chairman of the Standards and Priveleges committee, which required him to ajudicate allegations of MPs misconduct. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tSir George was educated at Christ Church Oxford and is married with two sons and two daughters. He is a keen cyclist and received the nickname \"the bicycling baronet\" after appearing in a British Rail advert promoting the transport of bikes on trains.\r\n\t\t\t Eric Pickles was first elected to the Commons in 1992, representing an Essex seat far from his Yorkshire roots. \r\r\n \r\r\nHe has extensive local government experience, having led Bradford District Council for three years up to 1991.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe has also served in a variety of shadow ministerial roles, including transport, local government and social security spokesman, earning a reputation for loyalty and good humour.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe boosted his reputation and profile in the party by masterminding its landmark victory over Labour in the Crewe and Nantwich by-election and was appointed party chairman in 2009.\r\r\n \r\r\nAnd he became a regular and confident media performer in the months leading up to the 2010 general election. Mr Shapps, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, since 2001, has made a name for himself as a keen and frequent media performer.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn his twenties he started a printing company.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn 2005, Mr Shapps became a deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, experience which will be useful in his new job as chairman.\r\r\n \r\r\nUntil the reshuffle, he served as housing minister, a role without full cabinet status but one which allowed him to attend meetings. A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, Sajiv Javid is the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He became an MP in 2010 and is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. He was a City banker and became a Treasury minister in 2013. Philip Hammond has built up a reputation as an articulate and effective Commons performer since being elected MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in 1997. \r\r\n\r\r\nA former director of companies supplying medical equipment, he was initially a member of the Conservative shadow health team before going on to serve as trade and industry spokesman. He also backed Michael Portillo's 2001 leadership bid. \r\r\n\r\r\nIn summer 2002, he went to shadow the now defunct Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government department before being made shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, at the age of 51, in the July 2007 reshuffle. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe became Transport Secretary after David Cameron's coalition took power after the 2010 election, building on his reputation there as an effective performer before being shifted into the defence brief after the resignation of Liam Fox from the job in October 2011. Tory Michael Gove was seen as one of the brightest talents in the 2005 intake. The former Times journalist is a key member of David Cameron's inner circle who helps write many of his speeches. \r\r\n\r\r\nAs the Tories' housing spokesman, Mr Gove made a name for himself as an effective Commons performer in attacks on the government's home information packs. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe was drafted into the shadow cabinet as children, schools and families spokesman, at the age of 39 when his leader split the education brief in two to reflect Gordon Brown's Whitehall changes. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Gove headed the Policy Exchange think tank for three years before landing the safe seat of Surrey Heath. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe had previously said he was prepared to give up a post in the new cabinet to ensure the deal with the Lib Dems went ahead, but he stuck with the education brief in government bringing forward a series of radical changes such as free schools and exam reforms. Liberal Democrat Ed Davey was appointed Energy and Climate Change Secretary on 3 February 2012 following the resignation of Chris Huhne.  \r\r\nMr Davey was elected MP for the newly created seat of Kingston in 1997 and has held a series of frontbench roles. Popular within the party, he was seen as an outside contender to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell when he stood down in 2007. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter serving as the Liberal Democrat spokesman for foreign affairs prior to the 2010 election, he was appointed business minister responsible for the Post Office, Royal Mail and employment relations in the coalition government.  Conservative MP Owen Paterson covered the Northern Ireland portfolio in opposition and in government before being moved to environment in David Cameron's reshuffle. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe entered the shadow cabinet for the first time, at the age of 50, in David Cameron's July 2007 reshuffle. \r\r\nA former managing director of the British Leather company, he entered Parliament as MP for Shropshire North in 1997, concentrating on rural issues as a junior agriculture spokesman and chairman of the Conservative Rural Action Group. \r\r\n\r\r\nA Eurosceptic and member of the right wing Cornerstone Group, which campaigns for traditional Tory values, he helped Iain Duncan Smith during his 2001 leadership bid and was briefly parliamentary private secretary to Ann Widdecombe. He has also served in the Opposition whips office. Jeremy Hunt was moved to the health brief after the overseeing the smooth running of the 2012 London Olympics. \r\r\nThe MP for South West Surrey since 2005, he became the Conservatives' culture spokesman in 2007. He was previously the party's spokesman on disabilities and welfare reform. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Hunt, a fluent Japanese speaker, founded a company called Hotcourses, offering guides to help students find the right course before entering university. \r\r\n\r\r\nAs culture secretary he had a chequered time, coming under pressure over his dealings with Rupert Murdoch's News International takeover bid. Justine Greening was promoted to the cabinet in October 2011 at the age of 42. \r\r\n\r\r\nMiss Greening, the MP for Putney since 2005, became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.\r\r\n \r\r\nBorn and educated in Yorkshire, Miss Greening studied economics at Southampton University, before getting an MBA from London Business School and worked as a finance manager at British Gas owner Centrica before joining the Commons.\r\r\n \r\r\nHer move from transport was widely perceived to be a result of her vocal opposition to the idea of a third runway being built at Heathrow. Chris Grayling's elevation to the post of Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary represented something of a comeback. \r\r\nPrior to the 2010 general election he had been shadow home secretary but, when the coalition was formed, he was made employment minister, rather than given a cabinet role. \r\r\n\r\r\nSeen as being on the right of the party, Mr Grayling's appointment to the justice role will be intended to reassure some Conservatives who were unhappy at predecessor Ken Clarke's prison reforms, claiming they were too lenient on criminals. \r\r\n\r\r\nEducated at Cambridge University, he is a former BBC News producer and the author of books on subjects including the Bridgewater Canal and Anglo-American relations. A former barrister, Ms Villiers was elected MP for Chipping Barnet in 2005. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power. \r\r\n \r\r\nA self-described Eurosceptic, she takes over from Owen Paterson in the post of Northern Ireland Secretary. Mr Carmichael has been appointed Scottish Secretary in the government's latest reshuffle. He replaces Michael Moore - a leading figure in the No campaign for the Scottish independence referendum. Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, has been the Lib Dems' chief whip and a government deputy chief whip since the formation of the coalition. He was previously the party's Scottish spokesman. Born in 1965, Mr Carmichael had a traditional upbringing on a hill farm on the Inner Hebrides island of Islay. He developed an early interest in politics, joining the Liberal Democrat party at just 14. He went on to work as a hotel manager before studying law at Aberdeen University. He then became a procurator fiscal depute, working mostly in the criminal courts. He was elected to the UK parliament in 2001, replacing Jim Wallace as MP for Orkney and Shetland. Danny Alexander was Nick Clegg's chief of staff and the Liberal Democrats' campaign co-ordinator throughout the election. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe was also the former media chief of pro-euro campaign group Britain in Europe, which brought together leading Labour and Lib Dem voices with business groups. \r\r\n\r\r\nFirst elected to Parliament in 2005, he rose to prominence when Mr Clegg became party leader in 2007. \r\r\nHe was the author of the party's 2010 election manifesto, becoming the Scottish Secretary in David Cameron's initial coalition cabinet. \r\r\n \r\r\nMr Alexander was promoted to chief secretary - a crucial role overseeing spending cuts - to succeed David Laws after was forced to quit over his expenses after less than three weeks in the job. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe is one of four key ministers, known as \"the Quad\", who meet to discuss the direction of much of the coalition's policy. \r\r\n\r\r\nThe Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey MP won one of 11 seats for the Lib Dems in Scotland. Patrick McLoughlin was the Tory chief whip while the party was in opposition and carried on after the 2010 general election as the government chief whip. \r\r\nThe former miner is the MP for Derbyshire Dales. \r\r\nWhen the Conservatives were previously in power, he was a minister at the departments of transport, employment, trade and industry, and in the whips' office. In opposition, he became deputy chief whip in 1998.\r\r\n \r\r\nMr McLoughlin's mother was a factory worker and he worked as a farm labourer before following his father and grandfather into the pits. \r\r\n\r\r\nHis move to transport in the reshuffle has raised speculation the government is planning to alter its current stance opposing a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Elected MP for Clwyd West in 2005, Mr Jones was a middle-ranking minister in the Wales Office before being promoted to the cabinet.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe replaces Cheryl Gillan. Several Welsh Conservatives have expressed their delight that an MP with a Welsh constituency is now in the top job within the department. Ms Gillan's constituency is in England.\r\r\n \r\r\nA Welsh speaker, Mr Jones served as a member of the Welsh Assembly before going to Westminster.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe is a fan of Liverpool Football Club and a keen user of the social networking website Twitter. He is also chairman of the Chinese Conservative Group. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green, is steering through a range of welfare changes in the role he has held since the 2010 election. A former army officer, who saw active service in Northern Ireland, Mr Duncan Smith entered Parliament in 1992 and rapidly established himself as one of the Maastricht rebels that made life so difficult for then Tory leader John Major. He was seen as a rising star of the Eurosceptic right and, after a spell as shadow defence secretary under William Hague, was the surprise victor in the September 2001 leadership contest, beating better-known and more experienced, Europhile candidate Ken Clarke. He had a torrid time as the Tory leader, failing to land many real blows on then PM Tony Blair and enduring a relentless barrage of criticism from the press and, in some cases, his own MPs. In November 2002, he urged his party to \"unite or die\" in response to persistent whisperings of a challenge to his leadership, but a year later he was ousted after narrowly failing to win the backing of enough MPs in a vote of confidence. After losing the Tory leadership, he has successfully reinvented himself as a social reform champion who, with his centre-right think tank Centre for Social Justice, has played an influential role in developing Conservative policy on welfare and the \"broken society\". David Cameron reportedly tried to persuade Mr Duncan Smith to move to become Justice Secretary in his September 2012 reshuffle, but Mr Duncan Smith opted to stay with the welfare brief. Mr Cameron has previously said that Mr Clarke is a \"big figure\" with \"great experience\". He was the last chancellor to lead the UK out of recession - during the John Major government of the 1990s. His return to the Tory front bench in 2009 was seen as of a gamble for Mr Cameron, given that Mr Clarke - who held a host of ministerial jobs in the Thatcher and Major governments - had staunchly pro-European views. These views were widely seen to be the reason for his failure to win the three party leadership contests he entered - but Mr Cameron decided that Mr Clarke's experience was worth the risk of reopening party splits. Mr Clarke was president of the Union at Cambridge, became a QC in 1980 and after a succession of junior ministerial jobs he served as health, education and home secretaries before becoming chancellor from 1993 to 1997. He served as Justice Secretary from May 2010 until the move to a \"roving role\" as a \"wise head\" based in the cabinet office. Lord (Jonathan) Hill of Oareford became leader of the Lords at the age of 52 in January 2013 when Lord Strathclyde resigned.\r\r\n Although this is his first Cabinet post, he has wide experience, having been at the Conservative Research Department and then special advisor to Ken Clarke at Transport in the 1980s before becoming John Major's political secretary in No 10 from 1992. \r\r\nHe has also worked for public relations firm Bell Pottinger and in 1998 he became a founding director of PR and lobbying firm Quiller\r\r\nConsultants, where he remained until 2010 when he was made an education minister in the new coalition government.  Andrew Lansley, a former civil servant, became an active Conservative in the 1980s after a spell as private secretary to Norman Tebbit. In 1990 he became head of the Conservative Research Department and was one of the architects of the Tories' surprise 1992 election victory. However, he later faced criticism for his central role in the disastrous 2001 poll campaign. He returned to the shadow cabinet in 2003 under Michael Howard as shadow health secretary, the brief he continued to hold under David Cameron. Mr Cameron had long guaranteed Mr Lansley - who has played a key role in convincing people that the NHS is a high priority for the Conservatives - the role of health secretary in a government led by him. During his two years as health secretary, he steered through a large package of reforms of the NHS in England, despite facing opposition on a number of fronts. A Conservative activist from an early age - and the son of a former Tory MP - Dominic Grieve was elected to the Commons in 1997 as the MP for Beaconsfield in South Buckinghamshire. He is a barrister and was the shadow attorney general for four and a half years until June 2008, when he was appointed shadow home secretary.\r\r\n He filled the vacancy created when David Davis quit as an MP to fight a by-election on civil liberties and plans for a 42-day terror detention limit.\r\r\n Mr Grieve is an ex-member of the London Diocesan Synod with an interest in constitutional issues and an opposition to devolution - he is a past shadow Scottish affairs spokesman.\r\r\n Regarded as a skilled and assiduous Commons performer, he was the Tories' shadow justice secretary ahead of the election. The attorney general is not a full cabinet position under David Cameron. ",

        "article": "The thwack of cricket balls being hit and the sight of bowlers running in are part of an English summer. But, 100 years ago, a strike almost put an end to things. In 1907 an anonymous satirist made a joke which still resonates today. Writing in Mr Punch's Book of Sport, he (or she) stated that the \"British sphere of influence\" could be described in just three words: \"The cricket ball.\" A few years later, as the Great Powers were edging closer towards the slaughter and misery of World War One, this round, red symbol of summer - and Empire - came under threat. Angered by their low wages, the cricket ball makers of Kent went on strike in April 1914. Fears were raised that the season would be affected, even cancelled. Hand-crafted in the area for more than 150 years by that time, the balls of west Kent, home to firms such as Dukes and Alfred Reader, were seen as the best. The workers were proud. The Times, many of its readers fearful of a summer without watching the greats of the day, such as Jack Hobbs and Frank Woolley, in action, gave unusual prominence to such a small-scale dispute. \"Workers employed in the manufacture of cricket balls at Tonbridge have gone on strike to enforce their demand for an increase in wages,\" it reported. \"They want an advance of five shillings per dozen balls. The manufacturers admit that highly skilled workmen only earn 30 shillings a week, but state that retailers refuse to allow a sufficient margin to allow of the payment of a fair wage.\" In other words, cricket clubs wanted cheap balls, even if this came at the expense of a tradition. We were going nowhere, so we decided to call it a day\u201d Semi-rural Kent does not lend itself to the image of a hotbed of industrial trade unionism, but its workers were offended. Its ball manufacturers employed several hundred people at the time, many of whom complained of being treated like \"sweated labour\". \"The power of the union may be largely a thing of the past, and cricket ball manufacture, along with pretty much everything else in cricket, has now largely moved to the subcontinent\", says Matt Thacker, managing editor of   magazine.  \"But it's great to be reminded occasionally how deeply ingrained into the fabric of English life cricket was. \"It's hard to imagine these days an English season coming under threat from anything but the IPL (Indian Premier League).\" Of all sports, except perhaps baseball, cricket is the most reliant on its balls. Spin, swing, bounce - the varying state of the five-and-a-bit-ounce, stitched mass of cork and leather can massively affect the nature of play. Almost unthinkably now, Kent was the centre of an export trade, with enthusiasts in countries like Australia and India buying its wares. After a few weeks, the Amalgamated Society of Cricket Ball Makers came to an agreement with the manufacturers and the threat of an end to cricket was abated. A few months after the strike, World War One began and, within weeks, the first-class game came to a halt, but leagues, particularly in the north of England, continued and even thrived. Demand for balls continued. The cricket ball makers were not alone in being able to flex considerable muscle on a local scale. \"There were lots of small unions around at this time and they were often very effective,\" says Chris Burgess, curator of the  . \"For instance, you had the Cigarette Machine Operators' Society and the Sheffield Chauffeurs' Society. \"Cricket ball making was a skilled trade. The union would have had a big presence within the factory, looking after workers' rights and campaigning on issues like wages.\" After the 1918 Armistice, the Amalgamated Society of Cricket Ball Makers' books were found to be in a terrible state. Amid disquiet over this, a separate group, the Teston Independent Society of Cricket Ball Makers, was formed in 1919, as its title suggests, in the village of Teston, home of the Alfred Reader factory. The two unions' job got harder as the once-closed world of ball manufacture - rather like Britain's position as undoubted ruler of the Empire - came under challenge. In 1930 the ASCBM again became involved in a dispute over pay. The Australian government imposed an import tariff on cricket balls and manufacturers proposed cutting wages to cope with a loss in profits. The Australian press noted that firms in the Tonbridge area still supplied \"almost the entire Empire\". This had changed somewhat by the start of 1953, when another walkout occurred. The ball makers demanded a 9% increase in wages, but their employers would only offer 6%. The Times noted with concern in early April: \"There are only 90 craftsmen in the country and 45 have not made a ball since March 27.\" The workers soon returned. Over the years, English ball-making continued to decline, with much of the work being outsourced to lower-wage countries, such as India and Pakistan. Kent workers held another strike in 1962, calling for a sixpence-an-hour rise. After a month out, they accepted three-and-a-half pence. It was something of an industrial relations last hurrah. Only a few people are employed in ball-making in west Kent today. One of them, Matthew Waldock, says: \"I started in the 1980s and there were about 50 or 60 people working here. The Test Match balls we made were a work of art.\" Most of the work today involves selecting the English leather to be sent abroad and testing the quality of the balls when they arrive back from factories in India. In 2006, the Teston Independent Society of Cricket Ball Makers disbanded. It had just six members, making it probably the UK's smallest union. The Sheffield Shearers Society, with just nine members, folded a year later. Mr Waldock, general secretary of the Teston society at the time it was wound up, says: \"We were going nowhere, so we decided to call it a day.\" The photographs of dozens of craftsmen - in their cloth caps, shirts and collars, some perched on bicycles - defiantly on strike in 1914 show how things have changed.

        "article": "As the Olivier Awards-nominated Handbagged opens in the West End and Red Velvet storms New York, is this a golden period for London's Tricycle Theatre? Backstage at the Vaudeville Theatre on the Strand, Indhu Rubasingham is still catching her breath after a whirlwind week. The artistic director of the Tricycle Theatre is just back from New York, where her production of Red Velvet has opened to glowing reviews.  Now she is putting the finishing touches to her production of Moira Buffini's new play Handbagged, which sold out at the Tricycle last year and is now making a leap into the West End. If you personally judge yourself by awards then you're going to nowhere\u201d The play, which imagines the meetings between the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, is also a nominee at this Sunday's Olivier Awards, where it is up for outstanding achievement in affiliate theatre. Red Velvet was nominated in the same category last year. \"It's a great time for the Tricycle,\" says Rubasingham, who took over as artistic director in May 2012 after Nicolas Kent's 28 years at the helm.  \"If you personally judge yourself by awards then you're going to nowhere. Where these things help is on marketing, audiences, fundraising and profile.\"  The play's transition from the 200-seat theatre in Kilburn to the 700-seater Vaudeville has, she says, involved \"quite a bit of editing and tightening\".  Handbagged started life as a 20-minute piece in 2010. Plans to expand it were almost abandoned when it was announced that Peter Morgan's The Audience would open in the West End in 2013.  That play, starring Helen Mirren as the Queen, imagined the private meetings between the monarch and her prime ministers over her 60-year reign. \"In the end we thought it didn't matter,\" explains Rubasingham. \"They're actually very different stories.\"  As it turned out, Margaret Thatcher died three days before Buffini was due to start work on the full-length play. \"People thought we were really quick off the mark but it was always going to happen.\"  Handbagged's big theatrical idea is to double up the main roles.  Hence there are younger and older versions of the Queen (played by Lucy Robinson and Marion Bailey, respectively) and Margaret Thatcher (Fenella Woolgar and Stella Gonet).  Rubasingham says having both versions of each character on stage at the same time brought its own challenges for her as director. \"One may start a thought and the other one may finish it - it wasn't naturalism, it was pure theatre.  I felt like the play was stretching me, rather than me trying to make it work.\"  Both she and Buffini were \"Thatcher children\". Rubasingham recalls growing up in Mansfield, near Nottingham, during the miners' strikes.  \"When Moira was writing it we would talk a lot about our experiences. You realise how things that started at the time are the catalysts of what's happening now.  \"I wasn't a Thatcher fan growing up. Now it's not that I agree with her, but I've understood her a bit more, and I really admire that someone in that time, as a woman, had that kind of conviction politics, whether or not you agree with those politics.\" Rubasingham says the opening of Red Velvet in New York earlier this month was an \"emotional\" moment. She and playwright Lolita Chakrabarti first began talking about bringing the story to the stage eight years ago.   Starring Chakrabarti's husband Adrian Lester, Red Velvet tells the story of pioneering African-American actor Ira Aldridge, who caused a sensation in London in 1833 when he took over the role of Othello after famous actor Edmund Kean collapsed on stage. The play was Rubasingham's first project when she took over at the Tricycle. Almost two years on, it's now creating waves across the Atlantic.  \"It's been a huge journey, there were times when both of us thought this was never going to happen. Very rarely do those moments crystallise into something like this.\" She adds excitedly that Robert Redford had already been to see it. \"How has this happened after all that time when people were shutting the doors on it?\"  She thinks the script has film potential, and predicts the play will have a long life even after Lester has stepped down from the lead role. What kind of impact does a New York run and a West End transfer - Rubasingham's first from the Tricycle - have on the Kilburn theatre's finances? \"I don't know yet. The show in New York is not going to bring money to the Tricycle but it hasn't cost us money - but it raises the profile.  \"With Handbagged it's early days. If it sells and we more than break even, then money will come to the Tricycle.\"  Rubasingham sees investment as a key issue in theatre. \"The theatre community has got to communicate to society why it's important. The work we've done with Handbagged and Red Velvet has only come from Arts Council investment. I can take those risks.   \"In New York people say they don't see work like that because there isn't that investment. \"As a country we've got to put that investment in the arts because its our moral compass, it's our social conscience. It's our spiritual well-being as a society.  \"It's not just about luvvies having fun.\"  ",

Some have also received training in what a selfie is - and what to do when they spot someone about to take one in or around a polling booth. \"We have told staff that if they see anyone taking a photograph they should ask the person to delete it but not try to wrestle the phone out of their hands,\" said an electoral services manager at an East of England local authority. \"It would depend on exactly what they were taking a photograph of. We have told them to take a note of the names and addresses of anyone doing it. But we would not necessarily call the police.\" She said staff would also make sure polling booths had open backs so they could see what was happening - and had been told to put up \"no photography\" signs outside and inside the polling station. Under Section 66 of the Representation of the People's Act it is a criminal offence to communicate information about the way someone has voted or is about to vote - or to communicate the unique identification number on the ballot paper.  The Electoral Commission fears people taking selfies could accidentally reveal details about how they, or someone else, has voted, potentially putting them in breach of the Act. But John Turner, chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said the law was not clear and needed to be updated for the 21st Century. \"There is not an Act of Parliament that says you should not take a selfie inside a polling station,\" he told BBC News.  \"This is essentially a piece of Victorian legislation and they didn't have mobile phones back then.\" Pressed on how he interpreted the law, he said taking a selfie and not showing it to anyone before polling stations closed would probably be within the law, but if they took a picture of the ballot paper \"and rushed outside and put it on Facebook\" they would be risking prosecution. But, he added, it would be up to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether to prosecute an individual. \"We are all up to our knees in the mire trying to work out what is against the law,\" said Mr Turner, but he added the best advice to anyone thinking of taking a polling booth selfie was that it was \"not worth the risk\". In its guidance to election administrators, the Electoral Commission said: \"The law relating to obtaining information in polling stations and disclosing such information is complex.  \"Given the risk that someone taking a photo inside a polling station may be in breach of the law, whether intentionally or not, our advice is that you should not allow photos to be taken inside polling stations.\" The Law Commission said it was reviewing all legislation on the way elections are conducted, including rules about secrecy and whether photography should be allowed, with a view to simplifying and updating them. It is due to publish proposals in the autumn, for consultation, ahead of a draft bill in 2017. ",

        "article": "The UK's data privacy watchdog has said that it would focus on \"evidence of damage and distress to individuals\" when reviewing complaints about Google and others' search results. The Information Commissioner's Office's   is its first official response to last week's \"right to be forgotten\" EU ruling. The ICO will be responsible for resolving complaints in cases where a search firm refuses to remove links. It noted such action was months away. \"This judgment was only made last week, and the companies will need some time to work out how they're going to handle this,\" wrote David Smith, the body's director of data protection. \"We won't be ruling on any complaints until the search providers have had a reasonable time to put their systems in place and start considering requests.\" The Court of Justice of the European Union set a legal precedent on 13 May when it   had the right to have links to web pages about him removed from Google's results because the passage of time had made them \"irrelevant\". The Spanish man had complained that Google's links to an auction notice of his repossessed home  infringed his privacy. The takedown demand only applied to search results and not the web page containing the notice itself.  But the court added that others had a similar right to have search results deleted \"unless there are particular reasons, such as the role played by the data subject in public life\" that would justify keeping the links online. The court noted that if search engines refused to comply, it would be up to local authorities - such as the ICO - to force their hand. Google said the ruling was \"disappointing\" and that it needed time to \"analyse the implications\". But Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, has attacked the judgement, calling it \"wide-sweeping internet censorship\", adding that it would be difficult for search firms to determine what should be removed, The ICO acknowledged the \"right to be forgotten\" would be difficult to implement. \"It is important to keep the implications in proportion and recognise that there is no absolute right to have links removed,\" wrote Mr Smith. \"Our concern remains how this can be achieved in practice and how to set reasonable expectations for the public about how such a right can operate.\" He added that the ICO and other data protection authorities would need to issue guidance, and said that the organisation planned to discuss the matter with its European counterparts at the start of next month.

        "article": "  \n\t\t \n\t Conservative David Cameron was virtually unknown outside Westminster when he was elected Tory leader in December 2005 at the age of 39. \r\r\nThe Old Etonian had dazzled that year's party conference with his youthful dynamism and charisma, reportedly telling journalists he was the \"heir to Blair\". He has sought to match the former PM by putting the Conservatives at the centre ground of British politics. After the 2010 election he led his party into coalition with the Lib Dems, making tackling the UK economy's deficit its priority. He has faced criticism from some on the right of the party but Mr Cameron has insisted the coalition will see through its full five-year term. Before becoming leader, he was the Conservatives' campaign co-ordinator at the 2005 general election and shadow education secretary. He was special adviser to Home Secretary Michael Howard and Chancellor Norman Lamont in the 1990s before spending seven years as a public relations executive with commercial broadcaster Carlton. In just five years, Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, a contemporary of Mr Cameron, went from political obscurity to the absolute front line of British politics. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter becoming MP for Sheffield Hallam at the 2005 election, he was promoted to Europe spokesman, before moving on to the home affairs role. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWhen Sir Menzies Campbell resigned as leader in 2007, he entered the race to succeed him, in the end narrowly beating Chris Huhne. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe really came to prominence during the televised debates ahead of the general election, being judged in polls to have been the big winner of the first one. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, this appeared to do little to help the Lib Dems when they actually lost seats on 6 May. The party, though, retained enough MPs to become the vital players in the hung parliament. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter taking his party into coalition with the Conservatives - and U-turning on a previous pledge to reject university tuition fees - Mr Clegg saw his personal poll ratings slump, but he has pointed to areas where Lib Dem policies have come into force on taxation and consitutional issues. \r\r\n\r\r\nLike David Cameron, he has insisted the coalition is working in the national interest and will continue for the full parliament. One of David Cameron's closest friends and Conservative allies, George Osborne rose rapidly after becoming MP for Tatton in 2001. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMichael Howard promoted him from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury to shadow chancellor in May 2005, at the age of 34. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Osborne took a key role in the election campaign and even before Mr Cameron became leader the two were being likened to Labour's Blair/Brown duo. The two have emulated them by becoming prime minister and chancellor, but have avoided the spats. \r\r\n\r\r\nSome prominent Conservatives have urged Mr Osborne to do more to promote economic growth. \r\r\n\r\r\nBefore entering Parliament, he was a special adviser in the agriculture department when the Tories were in government and later served as political secretary to William Hague.\r\r\n Theresa May is the second woman to hold the post of Home Secretary. \r\r\n\r\r\nShe was the first woman to become Conservative Party chairman, under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith. \r\r\n\r\r\nShe then took up the culture and family portfolios before being made shadow Commons leader by David Cameron. \r\r\nShe has been a keen advocate of positive action to recruit more women Tories to winnable seats and was a key architect of the \"A list\" of preferred candidates. \r\r\n\r\r\nA passionate moderniser, she famously ruffled feathers when she told Tory activists they were seen as members of the \"nasty party\". \r\r\nIn her role as home secretary, she has overseen widespread changes to the immigration system. \r\r\n\r\r\nMrs May was the shadow work and pensions minister ahead of the election. Since he returned to frontline politics in 2005, Conservative William Hague has become a key adviser to David Cameron, and was seen as de facto deputy party leader. \r\r\nThe foreign secretary has plenty of experience to call upon, having been Tory leader himself from 1997 to 2001 and shadow foreign secretary until the election. \r\r\n\r\r\nA witty and engaging Commons performer who is popular with grassroots Tory members, Mr Hague entered Parliament in 1989 having been special adviser to Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe. He was soon promoted to be a social security minister and in 1995 entered the cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales. \r\r\n\r\r\nIn addition to his duties as shadow foreign secretary, Mr Cameron put Mr Hague in charge of rebuilding the party in the North of England, as chairman of its Northern Board. Vince Cable has had a long journey to reach the front rank of politics, having been a Labour and then an SDP supporter before its merger with the Liberals to become the Liberal Democrats. \r\r\n\r\r\nAn economist by profession, he entered Parliament as MP for Twickenham in 1997 and has gradually built up his powerbase among the Lib Dems. \r\r\nAs the party's deputy leader and Treasury spokesman he saw his stock rising during the credit crunch because of his earlier warnings. \r\r\n\r\r\nWhen he stood in as temporary leader after the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell, he memorably described Gordon Brown as going from \"Stalin to Mr Bean\". \r\r\n\r\r\nHas had a colourful time in government, notably when he was recorded by under cover reporters saying he was at war with Rupert Murdoch's News International. He has been mentioned as a possible future leader of his party. \r\r\n\tSir George Young was replaced as leader of the Commons by Andrew Lansley in the September 2012 reshuffle, but was recalled and given the Chief Whip post a few weeks later following the resignation of Andrew Mitchell.\r\r\n \r\r\n\tSir George, 71 at the time of his return to the cabinet, is one of the most experienced members of the government and has served a number of roles in Conservative administrations since the 1970s. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tHe was elected as MP for Acton in 1974 and became a junior minister in the Thatcher government in 1979. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tIn 1994 he became Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and was promoted a year later to transport secretary. Switching seats to North West Hampshire in 1997, he was given the shadow Commons leader's job in the Tory opposition the same year.\r\r\n \r\r\n\tFrom 2001-09 he served as chairman of the Standards and Priveleges committee, which required him to ajudicate allegations of MPs misconduct. \r\r\n \r\r\n\tSir George was educated at Christ Church Oxford and is married with two sons and two daughters. He is a keen cyclist and received the nickname \"the bicycling baronet\" after appearing in a British Rail advert promoting the transport of bikes on trains.\r\n\t\t\t Eric Pickles was first elected to the Commons in 1992, representing an Essex seat far from his Yorkshire roots. \r\r\n \r\r\nHe has extensive local government experience, having led Bradford District Council for three years up to 1991.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe has also served in a variety of shadow ministerial roles, including transport, local government and social security spokesman, earning a reputation for loyalty and good humour.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe boosted his reputation and profile in the party by masterminding its landmark victory over Labour in the Crewe and Nantwich by-election and was appointed party chairman in 2009.\r\r\n \r\r\nAnd he became a regular and confident media performer in the months leading up to the 2010 general election. Mr Shapps, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, in Hertfordshire, since 2001, has made a name for himself as a keen and frequent media performer.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn his twenties he started a printing company.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn 2005, Mr Shapps became a deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, experience which will be useful in his new job as chairman.\r\r\n \r\r\nUntil the reshuffle, he served as housing minister, a role without full cabinet status but one which allowed him to attend meetings. A self-made millionaire and devotee of Margaret Thatcher, Sajiv Javid is the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister. He became an MP in 2010 and is regarded as one of the Conservatives' fastest-rising stars. He was a City banker and became a Treasury minister in 2013. Philip Hammond has built up a reputation as an articulate and effective Commons performer since being elected MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in 1997. \r\r\n\r\r\nA former director of companies supplying medical equipment, he was initially a member of the Conservative shadow health team before going on to serve as trade and industry spokesman. He also backed Michael Portillo's 2001 leadership bid. \r\r\n\r\r\nIn summer 2002, he went to shadow the now defunct Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government department before being made shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, at the age of 51, in the July 2007 reshuffle. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe became Transport Secretary after David Cameron's coalition took power after the 2010 election, building on his reputation there as an effective performer before being shifted into the defence brief after the resignation of Liam Fox from the job in October 2011. Tory Michael Gove was seen as one of the brightest talents in the 2005 intake. The former Times journalist is a key member of David Cameron's inner circle who helps write many of his speeches. \r\r\n\r\r\nAs the Tories' housing spokesman, Mr Gove made a name for himself as an effective Commons performer in attacks on the government's home information packs. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe was drafted into the shadow cabinet as children, schools and families spokesman, at the age of 39 when his leader split the education brief in two to reflect Gordon Brown's Whitehall changes. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Gove headed the Policy Exchange think tank for three years before landing the safe seat of Surrey Heath. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe had previously said he was prepared to give up a post in the new cabinet to ensure the deal with the Lib Dems went ahead, but he stuck with the education brief in government bringing forward a series of radical changes such as free schools and exam reforms. Liberal Democrat Ed Davey was appointed Energy and Climate Change Secretary on 3 February 2012 following the resignation of Chris Huhne.  \r\r\nMr Davey was elected MP for the newly created seat of Kingston in 1997 and has held a series of frontbench roles. Popular within the party, he was seen as an outside contender to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell when he stood down in 2007. \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter serving as the Liberal Democrat spokesman for foreign affairs prior to the 2010 election, he was appointed business minister responsible for the Post Office, Royal Mail and employment relations in the coalition government.  Conservative MP Owen Paterson covered the Northern Ireland portfolio in opposition and in government before being moved to environment in David Cameron's reshuffle. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe entered the shadow cabinet for the first time, at the age of 50, in David Cameron's July 2007 reshuffle. \r\r\nA former managing director of the British Leather company, he entered Parliament as MP for Shropshire North in 1997, concentrating on rural issues as a junior agriculture spokesman and chairman of the Conservative Rural Action Group. \r\r\n\r\r\nA Eurosceptic and member of the right wing Cornerstone Group, which campaigns for traditional Tory values, he helped Iain Duncan Smith during his 2001 leadership bid and was briefly parliamentary private secretary to Ann Widdecombe. He has also served in the Opposition whips office. Jeremy Hunt was moved to the health brief after the overseeing the smooth running of the 2012 London Olympics. \r\r\nThe MP for South West Surrey since 2005, he became the Conservatives' culture spokesman in 2007. He was previously the party's spokesman on disabilities and welfare reform. \r\r\n\r\r\nMr Hunt, a fluent Japanese speaker, founded a company called Hotcourses, offering guides to help students find the right course before entering university. \r\r\n\r\r\nAs culture secretary he had a chequered time, coming under pressure over his dealings with Rupert Murdoch's News International takeover bid. Justine Greening was promoted to the cabinet in October 2011 at the age of 42. \r\r\n\r\r\nMiss Greening, the MP for Putney since 2005, became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election, succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary.\r\r\n \r\r\nBorn and educated in Yorkshire, Miss Greening studied economics at Southampton University, before getting an MBA from London Business School and worked as a finance manager at British Gas owner Centrica before joining the Commons.\r\r\n \r\r\nHer move from transport was widely perceived to be a result of her vocal opposition to the idea of a third runway being built at Heathrow. Chris Grayling's elevation to the post of Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary represented something of a comeback. \r\r\nPrior to the 2010 general election he had been shadow home secretary but, when the coalition was formed, he was made employment minister, rather than given a cabinet role. \r\r\n\r\r\nSeen as being on the right of the party, Mr Grayling's appointment to the justice role will be intended to reassure some Conservatives who were unhappy at predecessor Ken Clarke's prison reforms, claiming they were too lenient on criminals. \r\r\n\r\r\nEducated at Cambridge University, he is a former BBC News producer and the author of books on subjects including the Bridgewater Canal and Anglo-American relations. A former barrister, Ms Villiers was elected MP for Chipping Barnet in 2005. Prior to that, she was a Member of the European Parliament for six years.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn December 2005, Mr Cameron promoted her to shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.\r\r\n \r\r\nIn 2007, she was made a shadow transport minister, a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power. \r\r\n \r\r\nA self-described Eurosceptic, she takes over from Owen Paterson in the post of Northern Ireland Secretary. Mr Carmichael has been appointed Scottish Secretary in the government's latest reshuffle. He replaces Michael Moore - a leading figure in the No campaign for the Scottish independence referendum. Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, has been the Lib Dems' chief whip and a government deputy chief whip since the formation of the coalition. He was previously the party's Scottish spokesman. Born in 1965, Mr Carmichael had a traditional upbringing on a hill farm on the Inner Hebrides island of Islay. He developed an early interest in politics, joining the Liberal Democrat party at just 14. He went on to work as a hotel manager before studying law at Aberdeen University. He then became a procurator fiscal depute, working mostly in the criminal courts. He was elected to the UK parliament in 2001, replacing Jim Wallace as MP for Orkney and Shetland. Danny Alexander was Nick Clegg's chief of staff and the Liberal Democrats' campaign co-ordinator throughout the election. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe was also the former media chief of pro-euro campaign group Britain in Europe, which brought together leading Labour and Lib Dem voices with business groups. \r\r\n\r\r\nFirst elected to Parliament in 2005, he rose to prominence when Mr Clegg became party leader in 2007. \r\r\nHe was the author of the party's 2010 election manifesto, becoming the Scottish Secretary in David Cameron's initial coalition cabinet. \r\r\n \r\r\nMr Alexander was promoted to chief secretary - a crucial role overseeing spending cuts - to succeed David Laws after was forced to quit over his expenses after less than three weeks in the job. \r\r\n\r\r\nHe is one of four key ministers, known as \"the Quad\", who meet to discuss the direction of much of the coalition's policy. \r\r\n\r\r\nThe Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey MP won one of 11 seats for the Lib Dems in Scotland. Patrick McLoughlin was the Tory chief whip while the party was in opposition and carried on after the 2010 general election as the government chief whip. \r\r\nThe former miner is the MP for Derbyshire Dales. \r\r\nWhen the Conservatives were previously in power, he was a minister at the departments of transport, employment, trade and industry, and in the whips' office. In opposition, he became deputy chief whip in 1998.\r\r\n \r\r\nMr McLoughlin's mother was a factory worker and he worked as a farm labourer before following his father and grandfather into the pits. \r\r\n\r\r\nHis move to transport in the reshuffle has raised speculation the government is planning to alter its current stance opposing a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Elected MP for Clwyd West in 2005, Mr Jones was a middle-ranking minister in the Wales Office before being promoted to the cabinet.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe replaces Cheryl Gillan. Several Welsh Conservatives have expressed their delight that an MP with a Welsh constituency is now in the top job within the department. Ms Gillan's constituency is in England.\r\r\n \r\r\nA Welsh speaker, Mr Jones served as a member of the Welsh Assembly before going to Westminster.\r\r\n \r\r\nHe is a fan of Liverpool Football Club and a keen user of the social networking website Twitter. He is also chairman of the Chinese Conservative Group. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green, is steering through a range of welfare changes in the role he has held since the 2010 election. A former army officer, who saw active service in Northern Ireland, Mr Duncan Smith entered Parliament in 1992 and rapidly established himself as one of the Maastricht rebels that made life so difficult for then Tory leader John Major. He was seen as a rising star of the Eurosceptic right and, after a spell as shadow defence secretary under William Hague, was the surprise victor in the September 2001 leadership contest, beating better-known and more experienced, Europhile candidate Ken Clarke. He had a torrid time as the Tory leader, failing to land many real blows on then PM Tony Blair and enduring a relentless barrage of criticism from the press and, in some cases, his own MPs. In November 2002, he urged his party to \"unite or die\" in response to persistent whisperings of a challenge to his leadership, but a year later he was ousted after narrowly failing to win the backing of enough MPs in a vote of confidence. After losing the Tory leadership, he has successfully reinvented himself as a social reform champion who, with his centre-right think tank Centre for Social Justice, has played an influential role in developing Conservative policy on welfare and the \"broken society\". David Cameron reportedly tried to persuade Mr Duncan Smith to move to become Justice Secretary in his September 2012 reshuffle, but Mr Duncan Smith opted to stay with the welfare brief. Mr Cameron has previously said that Mr Clarke is a \"big figure\" with \"great experience\". He was the last chancellor to lead the UK out of recession - during the John Major government of the 1990s. His return to the Tory front bench in 2009 was seen as of a gamble for Mr Cameron, given that Mr Clarke - who held a host of ministerial jobs in the Thatcher and Major governments - had staunchly pro-European views. These views were widely seen to be the reason for his failure to win the three party leadership contests he entered - but Mr Cameron decided that Mr Clarke's experience was worth the risk of reopening party splits. Mr Clarke was president of the Union at Cambridge, became a QC in 1980 and after a succession of junior ministerial jobs he served as health, education and home secretaries before becoming chancellor from 1993 to 1997. He served as Justice Secretary from May 2010 until the move to a \"roving role\" as a \"wise head\" based in the cabinet office. Lord (Jonathan) Hill of Oareford became leader of the Lords at the age of 52 in January 2013 when Lord Strathclyde resigned.\r\r\n Although this is his first Cabinet post, he has wide experience, having been at the Conservative Research Department and then special advisor to Ken Clarke at Transport in the 1980s before becoming John Major's political secretary in No 10 from 1992. \r\r\nHe has also worked for public relations firm Bell Pottinger and in 1998 he became a founding director of PR and lobbying firm Quiller\r\r\nConsultants, where he remained until 2010 when he was made an education minister in the new coalition government.  Andrew Lansley, a former civil servant, became an active Conservative in the 1980s after a spell as private secretary to Norman Tebbit. In 1990 he became head of the Conservative Research Department and was one of the architects of the Tories' surprise 1992 election victory. However, he later faced criticism for his central role in the disastrous 2001 poll campaign. He returned to the shadow cabinet in 2003 under Michael Howard as shadow health secretary, the brief he continued to hold under David Cameron. Mr Cameron had long guaranteed Mr Lansley - who has played a key role in convincing people that the NHS is a high priority for the Conservatives - the role of health secretary in a government led by him. During his two years as health secretary, he steered through a large package of reforms of the NHS in England, despite facing opposition on a number of fronts. A Conservative activist from an early age - and the son of a former Tory MP - Dominic Grieve was elected to the Commons in 1997 as the MP for Beaconsfield in South Buckinghamshire. He is a barrister and was the shadow attorney general for four and a half years until June 2008, when he was appointed shadow home secretary.\r\r\n He filled the vacancy created when David Davis quit as an MP to fight a by-election on civil liberties and plans for a 42-day terror detention limit.\r\r\n Mr Grieve is an ex-member of the London Diocesan Synod with an interest in constitutional issues and an opposition to devolution - he is a past shadow Scottish affairs spokesman.\r\r\n Regarded as a skilled and assiduous Commons performer, he was the Tories' shadow justice secretary ahead of the election. The attorney general is not a full cabinet position under David Cameron. ",

No minister has spoken to the Police Federation like this. No-one has dared.  Today was the day when a representative of the trade union of home secretaries took on what is, in effect, the bobbies' trade union. It's something ministers - whether Tory or Labour - have dreamt of doing for years as each took their turn to face humiliation at the Fed's Conference.  Some were heckled, some slow handclapped, others heard in orchestrated silence.  All were told they were betraying police officers who had died or been injured in the line of duty. Two years ago Theresa May was forced to stand in front of a conference slogan which dubbed her policies \"criminal\". Today was payback time. Why, though, did she do what her predecessors did not?  First, because the shocking list of police misconduct which she read out today - from Hillsborough to Lawrence to Tomlinson - has changed the public mood. Second, because deep cuts to police budgets and numbers have not led to the surge in lawlessness they predicted. Crime has, in fact, fallen.  Thirdly, because Plebgate revealed to the public gaze the misconduct politicians had suspected for years.  There is, though, one other reason.  Theresa May is an ambitious politician who knows people are eyeing her as a possible future leader of her party. She knew today that standing up to the police might prove as good for her career as standing up for them proved to be for politicians in the past. Below are the key messages and extracts of the home secretary's speech: I know many of you were sceptical. I know you meant it when you said that spending cuts would destroy the police as we know it, that the front line service would be ruined and that crime would go shooting up.\u2026But today we can say with confidence that spending cuts have not ended policing as we know it, the front line service has largely been maintained, and most important of all - according to both recorded crime statistics and the independent crime survey - crime is down by more than 10% since the election.  In the last few years, we have seen the Leveson Inquiry. The appalling conclusions of the Hillsborough independent panel. The death of Ian Tomlinson and the sacking of PC Harwood. The ongoing inquiry by an independent panel into the murder of Daniel Morgan. The first sacking of a chief constable for gross misconduct in modern times. The investigation of more than ten senior officers for acts of alleged misconduct and corruption. Allegations of rigged recorded crime statistics. The sacking of PCs Keith Wallis, James Glanville and Gillian Weatherley after \"Plebgate\". Worrying reports by the inspectorate about stop and search and domestic violence. The Herne Review into the conduct of the Metropolitan Police Special Demonstration Squad. The Ellison Review into allegations of corruption during the investigation of the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Further allegations that the police sought to smear Stephen\u201fs family. Soon, there will be another judge-led public inquiry into policing. When you remember the list of recent revelations about police misconduct, it is not enough to mouth platitudes about \"a few bad apples\". The problem might lie with a minority of officers, but it is still a significant problem, and a problem that needs to be addressed.\u2026 It cannot be right when officers under investigation by the IPCC comply with the rules by turning up for interview but then refuse to cooperate and decline to answer questions. Such behaviour - which I am told is often encouraged by the Federation - reveals an attitude that is far removed from the principles of public service felt by the majority of police officers. It is the same attitude exposed by HMIC when officers, called to help a woman who had suffered domestic violence, accidentally recorded themselves calling the victim a \"slag\" and a \"bitch\". It is the same attitude expressed when young black men ask the police why they are being stopped and searched and are told it is \"just routine\" even though according to the law, officers need \"reasonable grounds for suspicion\". It is an attitude that betrays contempt for the public these officers are supposed to serve - and every police officer in the land, every single police leader, and everybody in the Police Federation should confront it and expunge it from the ranks. The Police Federation is an organisation created by statute, it serves a public function and the Normington Review demonstrated very clearly that it is an organisation in need of greater transparency and accountability. So it is a change that I believe needs to be made.Change yourselves or we will change you. Theresa May's message to the police was as uncompromising as the black trousers and flat black lace ups she wore to deliver it.  ",
