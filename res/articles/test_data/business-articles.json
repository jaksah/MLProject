Output fell by 2.8% - \u00a3270m - compared with a month earlier, the   said.  But in the three months to the end of February, construction output grew 0.3% compared with the previous quarter.  Despite signs of improvement, the construction industry remains 13.2% below its pre recession peak. The ONS said the heavy rain and flooding that marked the wettest winter on record had caused delays in building work.  It added that repairs of flood damage had not yet filtered through to its data. The fall in February's construction output was the biggest monthly decline since November 2013 and dragged the annual growth figure lower.  The ONS said construction output increased 2.8% in the year to February, compared with a 5.7% increase in January. Output measures the amount charged by construction companies to customers for the work they do.  Within the figures, private sector new housing activity, which had driven growth in the construction sector in 2013, fell by 6.3% in February - the biggest fall for nearly a year. The construction industry contributes 6.3% to overall UK economic growth. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at HIS Global Insight said despite February's sharp fall, it was still likely that construction output would still see clear overall expansion in the first quarter of 2014, He pointed out that construction output in January and December had risen strongly and added that a rebound in construction activity in March of just 1% would result in quarterly growth of 0.5%. \"In fact, any growth in construction output in March would result in some overall expansion in the first quarter, as even flat output in March itself would see output up 0.1% in the first quarter,\" he said. \"It needs to be remembered that the implications for overall GDP growth in the first quarter are relatively limited.\" ",

        "article": "The Co-operative Bank has confirmed it made a loss of \u00a31.3bn for 2013. The losses, in line with expectations, come after the bank's failed bid to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Bank last year. The deal collapsed after the discovery of a \u00a31.5bn black hole in the Co-op Bank's balance sheet.  Parent company the Co-operative Group lost control of the bank to a group of US hedge funds that launched a rescue deal in December. The bank said it did not expect to make a profit in 2014 or 2015. It also apologised to its 4.7 million customers.    Media requires JavaScript to play. Co-op Bank chief executive Niall Booker said: \"We appreciate that customers and other stakeholders continue to feel angry about how past failings placed the future of the business so seriously at risk.  \"I would like to apologise to them, to thank them for their continued loyalty and to thank colleagues for their commitment during such difficult times.\" The bank said it would not pay out \u00a35m to former executives who left the bank after its near collapse last year. But Mr Booker will receive a \u00a32.9m pay package, which includes a basic salary of \u00a31.2m and up to \u00a31.7m in performance related bonuses.  Mr Booker could also receive a potential \u00a31.2m as part of a three year incentive plan based on the future performance of the business.  It said up to 40 of its high street branches will close this year, which is likely have an impact on jobs, although the bank has yet to put a figure on the number of posts under threat. The results were published after two earlier delays.  Beneath the news of the losses that were widely expected, those interested in the future of the Co-op Bank will focus on two things.  How is the bank progressing on its plans to raise a further \u00a3400m and is there any evidence of a decline in customer numbers? On the first, I am told negotiations are going well.  As yet, the Co-op Group - which owns 30% of the bank - has not agreed to inject more money and there will be a lot of interest in what it says about the issue when it publishes its own annual results next week. On the second there is mixed evidence.  The number of current account holders is up slightly while business customers - far more affected by the ratings downgrades suffered by the Co-op - has declined.  In March, Co-op Bank was forced to admit it had found another \u00a3400m black hole in its finances, forcing it to issue new shares in an attempt to raise the funds from investors.  The shortfall became apparent after the discovery of additional costs related to past misconduct and poor documentation. The biggest part of the additional costs relate to payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling and lapses in the provision of mortgages. The bank said it would pay \u00a3114m to compensate customers who had been overcharged on mortgage repayments,  It has also set aside \u00a3110m to cover breaches of the Consumer Credit Act and \u00a3103m to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI).  Small businesses that were mis-sold complex interest rate hedging products will collectively receive \u00a333m in compensation. The Co-op Bank's additional rights issue has also triggered speculation that the Co-op Group's remaining 30% stake could be diluted, because it would struggle to find additional funds to maintain its shareholding. In December, the bank was the subject of a dramatic \u00a31.5bn rescue deal in which its parent company, the Co-operative Group, lost control of the bank to a group of US hedge funds,  They took a 70% stake in the bank.  Chris Wheeler, a banking analyst at Mediobanca, told BBC the bank was in a \"parlous position\". He said: \"It needs \u00a3400m more capital, [it is] claiming it's going to be a rights issue, The Co-op Group has to put in \u00a3120m.    \"So, big capital gap to be filled, and if the Co-op is no longer a major shareholder, one asks the question as to really what is the future style of the bank, because it may no longer be part of the Co-op Group per se.\" He also questioned whether members of the Co-op Group would want to put more money into the bank, suggesting the group might chose to protect its other businesses, which include the supermarket chain Somerfield and the Co-operative funeral home business.  Lord McFall, a Labour Co-operative peer, told the BBC he thought the Co-op Group should still invest in the beleaguered bank.  \"If you break it you own it,\" he said, blaming bad management and a lack of leadership at the top of the group for the bank's misfortunes. \"Not only did they sell the crown jewels, but they vandalised them,\" he added. Mr Booker said he was confident the bank would raise the additional \u00a3400m it needed even if the Co-op Group chose not to put in any further cash. \"Shareholders are very, very supportive and I really, really think that we're going to get this through the gate,\" he added. The Co-op Group itself has been forced to delay the publication of its annual results, after the departure last month of its chief executive, Euan Sutherland. The group's losses are expected to be about \u00a32bn. Mr Sutherland left after it was revealed that in a Facebook post he had described the group as \"ungovernable\". Earlier in March, details of his basic salary of \u00a31.5m, including a retention bonus of another \u00a31.5m, were leaked to the press. On Wednesday, it emerged that former Labour City minister Lord Myners, who had been drafted in by the Co-op Group in December to lead a review of the business, had resigned his position on the board of directors. Lord Myners was appointed as an independent director by Co-op Group chair Ursula Lidbetter in December to undertake a full review of the entire business.  His initial findings showed the group's elected directors had overseen \"breathtakingly value-destructive\" decisions, among which were the Co-op's takeovers of Britannia building society and supermarket chain Somerfield. He also found its three-tier system of elected member representation - made up of area committees, regional boards and the group board - had \"consistently produced governors without the necessary qualifications and experience to provide effective board leadership\". Too many directors, he said, did not have any serious business experience and were therefore not qualified to keep senior managers in check. Instead, he recommended new group board directors should be appointed according to clear criteria of skills and experience. But some of the Co-op's most influential members are worried that the changes could damage the group's values. ",

It comes after Russia warned European countries of possible gas supply cuts because of Ukraine's energy debts. Separately, Nato has defended the accuracy of satellite images which it says show Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border in recent weeks. A Russian official earlier said the images depicted a military exercise that was held in August last year. Nato says the   early on Thursday show some 40,000 Russian troops near the border in late March and early April. They also reveal sophisticated warplanes and helicopters. Later, Nato released additional images, some dating back to 2013 and others from early 2014, purporting to show the same areas unoccupied prior to March. In a statement, the alliance says the images show that Russian claims that they are old were \"categorically false\" and that there was no evidence of military activity in these areas in 2013 or early 2014. In Washington, state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki condemned \"Russia's efforts to use energy as a tool of coercion\". She added that gas prices Ukraine was having to pay Moscow were not set by market forces, and that Washington was working with Ukraine to provide financing and help it find enough gas.  There are fears that current tensions between Russia and Ukraine could trigger gas shortages in Europe, as pipelines transiting Ukraine deliver Russian gas to several EU countries.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Could Russia turn off the taps? The BBC's Daniel Sandford reports Russian energy giant Gazprom says Ukraine owes it $2.2bn (\u00a31.2bn; 1.4bn euros) and recently doubled the price it must pay.  Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote to 18 European countries on Thursday warning that Ukraine's delays in paying for Russian gas had created a \"critical situation\". The   says that if Ukraine does not settle its energy bill, Gazprom would switch over to advance payment, and if those payments are not made, it would \"completely or partially cease gas deliveries\". Previous Russian gas disputes with Ukraine have led to gas shortages in several EU countries. The EU says it has extra supplies to deal with any such disruption now. Meanwhile, US President Barack Obama has spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone about the growing crisis in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists remain barricaded inside government buildings in Donetsk and Luhansk. President Obama told Ms Merkel that the US and its allies should prepare for fresh sanctions against Russia if the crisis escalates.  The separatists in the east - a mainly Russian-speaking region with close ties to Russia - are demanding referendums on self-rule.  In Donetsk they have declared a \"people's republic\". Gunmen have been seen among the protesters in Luhansk. Ukraine fears that the separatist actions are a provocation similar to the protests that gripped Crimea days before Russian troops annexed the peninsula last month. Russia denies the claim. President Obama and Chancellor Merkel also discussed issues relating to talks due to take place in Geneva next week between Russia, Ukraine, US and the EU to try to end the impasse - the first four-way talks since the crisis began.

        "article": "France has brought in rules to protect employees from work email disturbing them outside office hours. Would a law to this effect be feasible elsewhere? You're reclining on the beach admiring the surf when your phone goes beep. You've got mail. From your boss. In many jobs, work email doesn't stop when the employee leaves the office. And now France has decided to act. It has introduced rules to protect people working in the digital and consultancy sectors from work email outside office hours. Media reports took that to be before 9am and after 6pm. The deal signed between employers federations and unions says that employees will have to  .  Michel de La Force, chairman of the General Confederation of Managers, has said that \"digital working time\" would have to be measured. Some emailing outside of office hours would be allowed but only in \"exceptional circumstances\".   France has a 35-hour week, adopted in 1998. But the French are not alone in worrying about how portable devices have exposed employees to longer hours. In December 2011, Volkswagen announced that servers would stop sending emails 30 minutes after the end of employees' shifts, and only  . Their move  .  In the UK there is protection for many types of worker in the form of the Working Time Regulations, but the TUC argues this simply doesn't cover out-of-hours email. And there are exemptions for categories of worker like lawyers and doctors.  Employers can't force adults to work more than 48 hours a week - normally averaged over 17 weeks.  Exceptions apply:  Workers can opt out of the 48-hour week.  If an out-of-hours email ban was brought in, the situation could be similar and not everybody would be protected, says Andrew Lilley, an employment lawyer and managing partner at law firm Travers Smith. \"I imagine many jobs would be exempt, a bit like some of the exemptions in the Working Time Regulations.\"  Disruptive email is mainly a white-collar problem. It goes with the territory for certain jobs, such as lawyer or financier, where staff are managing their own time. But others further down the hierarchy working on fixed hours contracts are perhaps also in need of protection.  Technology has redrawn the working day. Woody Allen's 1972 film Play It Again Sam contains a running gag about a workaholic businessman. Played by Tony Roberts he begins every scene by phoning the office to give the telephone number where he can be reached and for how long, followed by the next contact number. He was the exception - workers used to be able to disappear. Today anyone with a smartphone is usually reachable.  An advertising professional who moved from London to New York describes a different email culture. \"I remember on my second day seeing an email from a work colleague sent very late that evening. To my surprise someone replied to it, and then the interaction continued online. And lo and behold we 'were working'. By contrast, in the UK, if I worked late I would often draft emails but save them in my inbox and send them first thing the next morning. That now seems ridiculous and archaic to me. Emails are constant here. It's not that they expect you to answer out of office hours. More that everyone is 'switched on' all the time - that's the culture and pace of New York. I never really heard the concept of work/life balance when I got to the US. There wasn't much complaining as people's expectations were different. It's not just in the corporate world. When my family were moving here and trying to get an apartment I remember being surprised and delighted that our realtor was calling and emailing us late on a Saturday night.\"  Michael Reid, an IT teacher at a Liverpool comprehensive, says his evenings are regularly interrupted. \"An email arrives at 11.45pm and you know a colleague is working late and you want to support them.\" When he sees it in his inbox he is \"crestfallen\", he says. \"It takes the joy out of what you are doing.\"  An advertising consultant in London, who wants to remain anonymous, says she is expected to respond to emails. Many come through between 18:00 and 22:00. \"Needless to say not all emails require an immediate response though if I'm to tell which do and don't, I do need to check them.\" Requests for information she accepts as part of the job. Others - \"can I remind you of X\" or invitations to meetings with no context - drive her \"nuts\", she says. She now switches her phone off when she goes to bed to ensure an uninterrupted night's sleep. Enforcing an email ban would be almost impossible, argues Alief Rezza, an oil analyst in Stavanger, Norway. He checks email every half hour when he leaves work at 16:30 until 19:00. The stock market is still open and he might get an urgent message from colleagues in London. When he wakes he checks to see if colleagues in the US or Singapore have been in touch. \"I don't think a ban would work. If Norway bans my company from sending emails to me then my company needs to make sure someone is able to cover the request that should have been in my inbox.\" The industry would find a way around it, he argues. Like many other lawyers, Lilley checks work email every hour or so during the evening and the same on holiday. In the days before smartphones he would receive phone calls. An email is less intrusive, he argues. \"The ability to be contactable on email means that a lot of people leave the office earlier than otherwise would be the case.\" It can be inconvenient of course. \"You can't deny there are occasions where you think I'd prefer to finish what I'm doing. I've had to stop working out in the gym to reply to a work email.\" But if you want to do a certain kind of legal work you have to be willing to be interrupted, he argues. And there is reassurance in knowing that colleagues can get hold of you to check crucial details. In the office we shop, email friends and go to the gym - the only thing we don't do much of is work. Meanwhile, at home we do our work email, take part in conference calls, write reports and have our best ideas, says Lucy Kellaway. Paul Sellers, TUC policy adviser, says the same problem that France is seeking to address exists in the UK.  He says people in the law, media, finance and local government are not being allowed to switch off. \"Why are we expecting people to work at 8.30 at night?\" The Working Time Regulations were drawn up in the 1990s before mobile phones were in wide circulation. The rules have not caught up.  NHS workers are paid to be on call even if they end up not working. \"If you're not being paid you're not being valued,\" Sellers says.  But another view is that leisure and work now increasingly blend into one. The new reality is that  , Financial Times columnist Lucy Kellaway has argued.  A ban on email is not the answer, argues Ksenia Zheltoukhova, research associate at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. It could even hurt workers who increasingly require flexible working - keeping in touch on trains, emailing between time zones and leaving early to look after the children. A better approach is to educate managers about work-life balance and encourage them to prioritise.  For some employees, the problem is not the email itself, but the collateral damage to loved ones.  \"For me out of hours emails go with the territory,\" says the advertising consultant. \"But my partner does mind.\" Lilley once thought he'd perfected the discreet glance at the phone during dinner. Now he's not so sure. \"I suspect you're more distracted in company than you think you are. It can be very irritating to people around you.\" ",

Current account holder Charlotte Brooks on why she switched banks More than 600,000 people have changed their current account provider in the first six months of a scheme designed to make switching banks easier. The 609,300 switches in the six months to the end of March marked an increase of 14% on the same period a year ago. Two thirds of customers are now aware of the service, according to the Payments Council, which oversees it.  But, with 46 million current account holders in the UK, switching levels remain relatively low. The Payments Council said the new, quicker service had taken the \"fear factor\" and \"barriers\" away from switching. Under the new rules current account holders should be able to move their bank account to another provider within seven days. It had taken up to 30 days to switch previously. The switching guarantee also means the new bank or building society has to arrange for the transfer of all existing incoming and outgoing payments to the new account. \"By making the Current Account Switch Service quick, hassle-free and removing the fear factor, we've taken away the barriers customers told us they had when it came to switching,\" said Gary Hocking, managing director of the Payments Council. Current accounts should also not be ignored when it comes to shopping around for the best rate\u201d \"There's also been a noticeable surge of advertising activity from current account providers, big and small, suggesting that the new service is helping foster competition and choice for customers.\" However, some have questioned the success of the new scheme. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: \"Despite an increase in public awareness and confidence, switching levels are still low, suggesting that the new seven-day service is not the game-changer that can significantly increase competition in banking.\" Tesco Bank and Virgin Money plan to launch current accounts this year, while existing providers have offered a range of incentives for customers to change or stick with their current bank, from interest on balances to one-off cash payments. Some current accounts now offer three times the interest rate of some instant access savings accounts, according to price comparison website Moneysupermarket. \"Current accounts should also not be ignored when it comes to shopping around for the best rate - especially as providers are also offering cash incentives to those who switch,\" said Kevin Mountford, head of banking at the website. \"However, people should be aware of high overdraft charges on some of these accounts. Those who regularly dip into their overdraft will find a better deal elsewhere.  \"In order to benefit from the higher rates, customers will need to meet the minimum funding requirements or other terms and conditions, so it is important to check these before you switch.\" ",

Mr Loi's father, known as Ya Kun, a bastardisation of his Chinese name, operated from Telok Ayer Square and later the Lau Pa Sat hawker centre, serving the classic Singapore breakfast offering: runny eggs, coffee and toast spread with kaya, a jam made of coconut milk and flavoured with pandan leaves. But when Mr Koon fell ill, after serving hungry crowds for more than 60 years, Mr Loi felt that it would be a shame if the family business disappeared. Most of his siblings were all older - his eldest sister is 20 years his senior - and did not want to take over the stand. But Mr Loi, who had seen the easy rapport his father had with his customers, and in return the loyalty they showed him, wanted to keep that essence alive. So one day he and his brother, Algie, finally worked up the courage to ask his father if they could take over running his stall. Sure, his father said - but it is very hard work. \"So he challenged us - do you think you can do it?\" says Mr Loi. The answer was almost instantly a resounding yes. After taking over from his father in 1998, Mr Loi and his brother were forced to relocate the business because of construction at Lau Pa Sat. They renamed the coffee stall Ya Kun Kaya Toast, and borrowed 10,000 Singapore dollars ($8,000; \u00a34,700) to get the business up and running. Mr Loi says his wife helped him write the tagline \"Coffeestall since 1944\", to place a large focus on the family history - which became even more important when his father died in 1999. The publicity materials for the new stall highlighted the story of how Mr Loi's father fled to Singapore on a junk boat from Hainan, China, in search of a new life in 1926, and how he worked his way up from coffee assistant to running his own stall. Although Mr Loi says he was anxious - renting the 1,000 sq ft (90sq m) space cost a considerable sum - within two weeks the new stall had already broken even. \"We realised, hey this is a good business, because my dad really built a name for himself,\" he says. After that initial success, Mr Loi brought in consultants to see if he needed to get outside investment to help the company grow. In the end, he decided instead to apply for a grant from the Singaporean government instead of diluting his ownership share, which is now around 75%, after he bought out one partner and his brother reduced his holdings. I hope to slowly pass on my skill and my knowledge to my son so that one day he can take over my business\u201d That grant allowed him to investigate franchising opportunities - which he says was a resounding success, with more than 400 applications from potential franchisee owners in just six months. Since then, he has grown the business to more than 50 Ya Kun coffee shops in Singapore as well as 49 outlets across the globe, from Indonesia to Abu Dhabi. Last year the company's turnover was approximately 25m Singapore dollars - a 2,000% increase since Mr Loi took over in 1998. \"Singapore is one of the most cosmopolitan countries in the world,\" says Mr Loi.  That helps Ya Kun, because while workers are posted to the city state, they are exposed to Ya Kun's brand - so that when they see an outlet when they return home to say, Indonesia, they will often continue patronising the chain. Mr Loi says that the peculiarity of Singaporean eating habits has also helped the company grow. \"In Singapore, most people eat five meals a day - they have breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and supper. So every now and then they will come for coffee and then come back again,\" he says. That has helped Ya Kun become a household name, prompting one blogger to ask recently: \"Is there anyone here who has never eaten at Ya Kun?\" Mr Loi has also expanded the menu offerings to including noodle soups and other lunch dishes, as well as different types of toast and coffee. He says that he is lucky that his family have been incredibly supportive as the company has thrived. \"Once you have a lot of siblings there can be sibling rivalry - but not with us,\" he says. \"Even though we have grown so big, they don't envy me and they're still helping out in the business,\" adding that several family members continue to run individual stores. He says they joke that his dad would rise from the dead if he saw how far his humble stall has gone. \"He never would have expected how far we've grown,\" Mr Loi says with pride.  And he hopes to keep things that way: his son, who is 28, recently returned back to Singapore. \"I hope to slowly pass on my skill and my knowledge to my son so that one day he can take over my business,\" he says.

        "article": "Germany is an enlightened leader in the global battle to reduce CO2 emissions, a pioneer in renewable energy and community power projects and a champion of energy efficiency. Or so the common narrative goes. But try telling that to Monika Schulz-Hopfner. She and her husband, along with 250 other residents of Atterwasch, a quiet village near the Polish border, face eviction from their home of 30 years to make way for the Janschwalde-Nord coal mine.  And not just any old coal, but lignite, the dirtiest form of this ancient fossil fuel that is mined in vast opencast pits. If the plans go ahead, the village, parts of which date back more than 700 years, will be demolished. \"Since the plans for the mine were unveiled in 2007, we have lived with this constant threat, which has taken over the lives of every individual and the community as a whole,\" says Mrs Schulz-Hopfner. \"Every single decision we make is affected by it.\" And the residents of Atterwasch are not alone.  In the eastern German region of Lausitz, nine villages are under threat, where up to 3,000 people could lose their homes to make way for five new lignite mines that are fuelling the country's renewed thirst for coal. Two further mines are under consideration. The mines are needed to power a new generation of coal power plants. Two new lignite plants were opened in 2012, with a further two in the pipeline. Another two hard coal plants also opened last year, with a further five opening this year or next, with two more awaiting licences. The effects are already being felt. Lignite production in 2012 hit its highest level for almost 20 years, while initial estimates suggest this brown coal was used to generate 162bn kWh of electricity last year, more than in any year since 1990. The use of hard coal also increased, meaning the two energy sources accounted for 46% of Germany's overall energy production. The impact on CO2 emissions has been immediate. \"There has been an increase of between 5%-7% in CO2 in the past two years,\" says Prof Claudia Kemfert, head of energy at the German Institute for Economic Research. And this in a country that aims to reduce emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020. As Prof Christian Hey, secretary general of the German Advisory Council for the Environment, says: \"Germany has a coal problem.\" There are many reasons why. One is the low cost of carbon. \"Due to the failure of the emissions trading system, the price of CO2 permits is very low,\" says Prof Hey. \"The EU has failed to address this issue.\" Oversupply and a fall in demand for energy - and therefore permits - during the economic downturn means the price now stands at around three euros per tonne of CO2. If everything had gone to plan, the price would be more than 10 times that by now. Overcapacity has also pushed the price of coal lower, while the lignite industry has benefited to the tune of 60 million euros from being exempt from supporting the renewables industry, says Prof Hey. This means the fossil fuel has moved down what is called the merit order curve. This was introduced in Germany in the 1990s, and determines the order in which energy sources are used to satisfy demand. The cheapest source is used first, the second cheapest second, and so on. Source: World Coal Association, Store Norske Renewables are currently the cheapest, followed by nuclear. Lignite comes next, followed by hard coal. And as the government has resolved to phase out nuclear power by 2022, lignite will move further down the curve. Until the carbon price rises, then, lignite is set to remain at the heart of German energy production.  \"This is one of the biggest inconsistencies of the energy transition, and if the government wanted to address it, it could,\" says Prof Hey. \"To address this paradox, the government needs to adopt a regulatory approach on coal. It is relying on the market, rather than regulation, and this is key to the problem.\" Or as Prof Kemfert puts it: \"The government isn't doing anything.\" In fact, the new coalition has said that all fossil fuel power sources are equally important for the security of supply for the foreseeable future. But despite government inaction, there are some reasons to believe the growing use of lignite may not last.  All the new coal plants built in recent years, together with those that are due to open this year and next, were given the go-ahead about 10 years ago, when energy prices were much higher than now. Some argue that such massive investments are simply not viable in today's economic climate. As Mariana Heinrich at Poyry Managing Consulting says, these plants \"represent the end of a business cycle and not a longer term trend\". More importantly perhaps, \"there is no public or political appetite for building [new coal plants] for the next 30-40 years,\" argues Lars Waldmann, senior associate at the Agora Energiewende think tank. And he says that lignite is not needed to fill the gap that will be left by phasing out nuclear power, a decision taken as far back as 2000. \"We hope and think that gas will fill the gap, as there is enough installed capacity,\" says Mr Waldmann. This capacity is largely dormant right now due to the cheap price of coal, and the rising price of gas. \"From the economic side, renewables and gas can be the cheapest way to cover all demand.\" Mrs Schulz-Hopfner will take little comfort in that. \"It is idiotic. We don't need more and more lignite because we are using more renewable energy,\" she says. \"If we Germans truly want the Energiewende (energy transition), then no more villages should be demolished.\" But the new generation of coal plants means the fossil fuel will remain a key component of Germany's energy mix. The fact that lignite will always be cheap to produce, allied with a powerful pro-coal lobby in German politics, means the temptation to rely on this dirty fuel will remain strong as long as the carbon price remains low. For a country that, in so many respects, is a leader in clean energy, not to mention committed to stringent carbon dioxide emissions reductions, this contradiction seems odd to say the least. ",

        "article": "Bamboo is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. Sturdy and tenacious, it symbolises virtue. In fact, the plant has had a profound impact on the daily life, culture and spirituality of the Chinese. In the past, a wide variety of products were made from bamboo - from roof tiles and rafts, to shoes, furniture and agricultural tools. But despite the close relationship between Chinese-speaking societies and the natural material, Taiwan's bamboo industry has suffered a decline in recent decades. It nearly collapsed because of people's preference for more modern-looking products, or just cheaper plastic goods - and the impact of less expensive bamboo imports from China and South East Asia. Never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different products\u201d Nowhere was this more apparent than in central Taiwan's Zhushan or \"Bamboo Mountain\" town. Hundreds of families used to make bamboo products there in the centre of the country's bamboo industry. Now there are only about 50. It's a trend reflected in other parts of Taiwan - only about 240 bamboo-products businesses remain on the island. \"In the past, every part of Taiwan had people working in this industry, but over the years, bamboo has been replaced by plastic or steel to make all sorts of products, such as clothes hanging poles, baby cribs, and furniture,\" says Yang Chun-hsien, director of the Forestry Bureau's reforestation and production division. However, an earthquake and strong resolve on the part of the government and industry to continue using bamboo have led to a revival and transformation in its use. In recent years, bamboo has been used to make items never before associated with the plant - from shampoo and insect repellent, to socks, gloves, and even roasted peanuts. This reinvention of how bamboo is used has made it possible for the small family businesses which make up the industry to stay alive and to start reversing the decades of decline. At the height of bamboo production in Taiwan in the 1970s, more than 13 million stalks were harvested each year, and sales of the stalks alone - not including the finished products - amounted to $3.5m (\u00a32.1m) per annum. Plastic is very cheap and can be used for longer,  but what a shame, bamboo is more environmentally friendly\u201d But in the past decade, the annual harvest amounted to only about 1.67 million stalks with sales adding up to just $456,000 - a little over 10% of the peak level. Production and sales, however, have been steadily climbing in recent years.  Following a devastating earthquake on 21 September 1999 centred in Nantou county, where Zhushan lies, the central government decided to help the local economy by commissioning the country's non-profit Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to find new ways to help the bamboo industry grow. ITRI developed a method to carbonise bamboo stalks to produce high quality bamboo charcoal, which has a multitude of different uses. Naturally insulating, the charcoal can be turned into fibres and woven into fabric to make hats, scarves, gloves, socks and pants. Also said to be health giving, it is increasingly added to bodycare products, such as skin creams. Meanwhile, in industry it is used to purify water and air. Yet its most unusual application has to be in the production of bamboo charcoal-coated peanuts - which look exactly as they sound - peanuts covered with charcoal. Many people who have never tasted them are queasy about giving them a try, but they actually taste good, not at all like charcoal, and are believed to have health benefits. Such diversification has bought new hope to Taiwan's bamboo industry. \"When I was growing up, the toys we played with were made of bamboo,\" says Chen Ching-fu, general manager of the Bamboo Culture Park in Zhushan - a manufacturer of bamboo product, and the first visitor attraction in Taiwan devoted to the plant. \"Bamboo was all around us, but never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different types of products.\" Like other businesses, Mr Chen's now sells not only traditional bamboo furniture, but other products such as air fresheners and clothing. Besides bamboo charcoal, the Taiwanese have also found ways to use the actual bamboo to make a much wider variety of products than their ancestors did, including floor panels, pens, clothes hangers and even laptop casings. Sales of goods made from all forms of bamboo in Taiwan now reach $100m, with exports increasing alongside domestic sales. One of the trends helping to drive the revival of the industry is the return of second or third generation young people to help run family businesses. Lin Li-wei, 36, worked at a post office in the capital Taipei after graduating from college. But, making only about $600 a month, he came back to assist his father, who made bamboo ear diggers used by Chinese and Japanese people to remove earwax. He's now put a new spin on the family business - making modern looking clocks, lamps and wall lights out of bamboo. He has been receiving orders for his creations. \"My father supports me trying to innovate,\" says Mr Lin. \"Only through innovations can we add value to our products and continue our business.\" Now he and his father make $5,000 a month. Many of the manufacturers in Zhushan are breaking even, but not making big profits. Still, they persevere, seeing it as their mission to continue to promote the use of bamboo. Bamboo grows fast - just five years to reach maturity, making it one of the most environmentally-friendly plants to use. So growers and industry leaders hope they can replace the use of many types of other wood, and plastic. \"Plastic is very cheap and can be used for a longer time, but what a shame. Bamboo is more environmentally friendly, no chemicals are used to make bamboo products, and the trees grow without the need for fertiliser or pesticides,\" said the Forestry Bureau's Mr Yang. \"Bamboo can also absorb a lot of carbon dioxide and can reduce greenhouse gases.\" Back at the Bamboo Culture Park, Mr Chen has created a do-it-yourself workshop where schoolchildren and other tourists can learn how bamboo charcoal is made and make their own bamboo products. \"Taiwan can't be without bamboo because it's a material we've relied on for generations,\" says Mr Chen. \"I want to help people understand the importance and benefits of using bamboo.\" To hear Cindy Sui's radio version of her look at Taiwan's bamboo industry, check out  ",

        "article": "It was a revolution moving higher education from bricks to clicks\u2026 and now it's started to go back to bricks again.  Online university providers, which offered people the chance to study from home, are turning full circle by creating a network of learning centres where students can meet and study together. Instead of demolishing the dusty old classrooms, the online university revolution is responsible for opening some new ones. Coursera, a major California-based provider of online courses, is creating an international network of \"learning hubs\", where students can follow these virtual courses in real-life, bricks and mortar settings. And there are thousands of meet-ups in cafes and libraries where students get together to talk about their online courses. This is the latest stage in the rapid evolution of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses - where some of the world's leading universities have created digital versions of courses which are offered free over the internet. Coursera now has seven million registered users. That's bigger than the entire university populations of the UK and France combined. But it seems there is an irresistible social side to learning. Finding stuff out together seems to be more appealing than following a course alone. The Coursera learning hubs are running in more than 30 cities, from Baghdad to Buenos Aires, Moscow to Mumbai and Shanghai to Santiago. The learning hubs are run by partner organisations, providing a place where students following Coursera online courses can come to study together and get help from mentors. In Moscow, the learning hub is hosted by Digital October, a centre for technology and entrepreneurship. Yulia Lesnikova, director of educational programs, says it provides a more sociable way of following online courses. \"Education is a two-way process\u2026 It's a shoulder to lean on,\" she says. Students can work in groups on practical projects together with experts available to give advice. \"Mentors give a lot of help to people who don't understand.\" There have been four online courses so far followed in the Moscow learning hub. This includes a course about genetics created by the University of British Columbia, with students in Moscow being supported by an expert from one of Russia's oldest genetics institutes. There is a course on gamification from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, with sub-titles in Russian. When students are gathered for their Mooc classes it becomes a focus for other spin-offs, such as firms wanting to recruit staff or to get students involved in developing commercial projects. In Beijing, the learning hub has been set up with Guokr, a Chinese science-based social networking website. Yang Liu, Guokr's education director, says studying as a group provides a way of keeping students connected. It's also introduced the word \"Moocer\" into China, she says. \"Learning can be very lonely, they can drop out.\" It can be a more effective way of studying, she says. In a group of people there's likely to be a spread of knowledge, with students able to help one another. \"It's like a village, they form a small society.\" It also allows for different types of learner to be supported. About half of the people following Coursera courses in Beijing are university students, she says. But there are also isolated individuals who like the social setting, such as older people living alone or mothers looking after children at home. Yin Lu, responsible for Coursera's international development, says learning hubs have a wide range of local approaches. They can be based around tutors or around organised projects or else emphasise the social aspect of learning. In India, the focus is on teacher training and professional development. It means that courses designed for students in the US or Europe are being played out in classrooms in New Delhi and Mumbai. What has become apparent, she says, is that there is a much lower drop-out rate for students who attend a learning hub. Moocs allow anyone to enter, with no barriers from cost or qualifications, but that also means relatively few ever finish a course. Ms Lu says that the typical completion rate for a Mooc is about 5% to 10%. For Mooc students attending learning hubs, the completion rates are between 30% and 100%, she says. Ms Lu says it's likely that more hubs will open where there are concentrations of Coursera students. But she says there are no plans for these learning hubs to become fully-fledged colleges, where students might take exams as well as follow courses.  \"We exist to complement what universities can provide,\" she says.  But it wouldn't be difficult to imagine the commercial possibilities if they changed their mind. There is something almost organic about how these digital projects have taken root in the physical world. Moocs were meant to be the university courses of the laptop era, self-sustaining and free-standing, with students able to stop and start materials on the internet and get online support from social networking. But you can't stop people from wanting to talk to each other, outside the computer screen. As well as the more formal learning hubs, self-organised \"meet-ups\" for Coursera students have sprung up in more than 3,700 cities around the world, based around specific Coursera online courses.  For example, in London there are groups meeting in cafes at the British Library and the South Bank Centre. In Paris, there are meetings in the Pompidou Centre and in university buildings. Meet-ups are held in a whole range of public places, where students want to discuss and debate these digital courses.  They're scheduled and arranged online, with the only vital ingredients being a laptop, wi-fi and somewhere to talk. Even virtual students want to have a cup of coffee and a conversation after a lecture.  Will students always want to meet up and talk, even if they are studying online? Will Moocs end up creating their own colleges and universities? If you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can contact you on.

        "article": "The Co-operative Group has reported losses of \u00a32.5bn for 2013, the worst results in the organisation's history. The results come shortly after the loss of two directors amid a review into how the group ought to be governed.  Lord Paul Myners quit as a board member following resistance to his plans for reform. His departure followed the exit of chief executive Euan Sutherland who left after less than a year in the job. What exactly does the Co-operative Group do, and how is it run? And will it be possible for it to maintain its spirit and ethics through all the changes? The co-operative movement in the UK began in the north of England in the mid-19th Century. These societies were owned by their members and were usually small retailers which sold a variety of goods.  They came about to sell \"pure\" food at \"full weight and measure\" at a time during the industrial revolution when these things were not guaranteed at shops, according to one of their  . Coming together meant they could combine their buying power and control quality.  The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed in 1863. It has come to be called the Co-operative Group, and is the flagship organisation in the co-operative movement. Gillian Lonergan, head of heritage resources at the Co-operative Heritage Trust, says that in the 19th Century there were as many as 1,000 co-operative societies in Britain. Soon, a division for loans and deposits developed. Founded in 1872, this former part of the group turned into what is now called the Co-operative Bank. Today, the Co-operative Group has food, pharmacy, funeral, electrical, travel and legal businesses. It is the largest \"mutual\" business in the UK, owned by its customers and members who number almost 8 million. The grocer, called Co-operative Food, became the fifth-largest food retail business in the UK after buying Somerfield in 2009. It's the group's biggest business, making more than half of all sales. The Co-operative Group is also the biggest funeral provider and it owns the country's third-largest chain of pharmacies. According to its  , the Co-operative Group runs 4,500 stores, employs more than 90,000 people and has annual sales of more than \u00a313bn. The group lost full ownership of Co-operative Bank after owners of its debt had to bail it out when it uncovered \u00a31.5bn of unexpected losses. Co-op Group now owns about 30% of the lender. The group is owned by its members and 80 or so member societies.  Area committees are the grass roots of the organisation. There are about 48 of them, each with 10 to 12 members who serve three-year, elected terms. These area committee members elect members of the seven regional boards. They, in turn, elect 15 of the 21 members of the group's board. Of the remaining six, five come from member societies, such as Midcounties and Midlands, and there's an independent director, the role held by Lord Myners. There are also boards for the food business; the bank, which the group no longer fully owns; and specialist businesses, which include the pharmacies and funeral care. The group is very keen to point out the advantages of being owned by members and customers, as opposed to being a company owned by shareholders. Critics point to the complexity of how the business is governed and the sheer number of people who have some say in the running of the company. But Co-op say its democratic structure is part of its strength. It means a big organisation can make use of ideas and knowledge relevant to local communities. It can also listen on things like pay. But a   by Lord Myners casts doubt on how well the setup is working in practice. What makes matters more complicated is that while there are no shareholders, the group does issue bonds - loans held not by a bank, but by investors looking for a return.  While bondholders have no say in the running of the company, they can become influential when a company is in trouble. When the Co-op's bank needed rescuing, bondholders swapped their loans for a combined 70% ownership stake in the lender. Following the losses at the lender's bank, the company last year appointed former City minster, Lord Myners, to review the group's governance structure and made him its independent director.  The process has thus far been a painful one. Co-op Group lost its chief executive, Mr Sutherland, when he resigned following the leak of his \u00a33m-a-year pay package to a national newspaper. He told the BBC: \"The senior democrats talk the talk of reform, but in practice they won't do it.\" Lord Myners quit the board amid criticism of his plans to reform the business. His initial review was highly critical of the group's takeovers of Britannia and Somerfield. The first stage of the Myners review accuses the Co-op of suffering from a significant \"democratic deficit\" in which ordinary members have surprisingly weak constitutional rights and a limited ability to influence the group's social mission and activities. The three-tiered governance system of area committees, regional boards and a group board had \"consistently produced governors without the necessary qualifications and experience to provide effective board leadership\", he added.  Lord Myners also said the system meant ordinary members could not directly elect group board members. Midcounties, the largest of the Co-op's independent societies with revenues of \u00a31.2bn and more than 10,000 employees, has publicly opposed the planned reforms. Its president, Patrick Gray,   they would not support the \"menu\" Lord Myners is offering, and that there needed to be negotiation.  \"Among the independent consumer co-operative societies, it is demonstrably the case that it is the most democratic that are the most successful in commercial terms, not the reverse,\" Midcounties said. With  , it's a complex business. Reform in any format is unlikely to be quick. In short, no. The Co-operative Group says it accounts for about 80% of the total Co-operative movement in the UK.  Co-operatives UK, the trade body for societies, estimates the co-operative economy is worth about \u00a336.7bn and has 15.4 million members. While most co-operatives are in retail or agriculture, they include  . ",

        "article": "Thousands of protesters marched on a McDonald's campus that houses its Hamburger University training facility, demanding higher wages for workers. The site of the planned protest was changed after McDonald's vacated its headquarters in the US state of Illinois after consulting with police. Protesters want the fast food giant pay a minimum wage of $15 (\u00a39) per hour, double the US federal minimum wage. The company's annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for Thursday. The closure affected one of five McDonald's corporate buildings and about 3,000 employees. Protesters - which included a few hundred McDonald's workers - said they were seeking to highlight how low wages have exacerbated income inequality in the US. The protest was planned before the annual shareholder meeting, where a vote is expected on executive pay. Last year, chief executive Don Thompson was paid $9.5m. Shareholders in Mexican fast-food chain Chipotle recently rejected an executive pay plan for the firm's co-chief executives,  Steve Ells and Monty Moran, who earned $25.1m and $24.4m, respectively, last year. Fast-food workers and labour organisers have been protesting since 2012 in an effort to boost wages and win worker rights, such as paid sick leave.  Last week, they organised a global walk out in more than 250 cities to highlight what they say are the difficulties facing low-paid restaurant employees. US President Barack Obama has pushed Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from $7.25, however he has faced stiff opposition from Republicans. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fast-food workers in the US earn about $8.83 per hour, or $18,400 per year if they are working a full 40-hour work week.

Shares are due to start trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday under the symbol 'JD' at the price of $19 per share.  JD.com is China's second largest e-commerce firm after Alibaba.   The IPO will be closely watched as a measure of Wall Street's appetite for Chinese internet firms. The e-commerce industry in China is attracting a lot of interest, due to increasing affluence in the world's second largest economy as well as rising access to the internet.  According to research firm eMarketer, China's business to consumer e-commerce sales may surpass $180bn this year.  In its  , JD.com said it had a 17.5% market share based on transaction volume, as of the third quarter of last year. The figures are based on calculations by iResearch, a research firm.  Asia's biggest internet company, Tencent Holdings, bought a 15% stake in JD.com in March this year, in an attempt to grab a larger share of China's online shopping market.  Under the deal, JD.com will take full control of Tencent's e-commerce business, which includes subsidiaries such as QQ Wanggou and Paipai. The purchase signals heightened efforts by Tencent to take on rival Alibaba.  JD.com's list of investors include Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, with a 5% stake.  The e-commerce firm plans to use proceeds from the IPO to expand its infrastructure needs with the building of new warehouses and establishing more delivery stations. It also wants to build a fund for potential investments in and acquisitions of complementary businesses, assets and technologies. US investors will be watching how JD.com shares perform on Nasdaq, hoping for clues as to how Wall Street will receive rival Alibaba, which filed for an IPO earlier this month.  Analysts are expecting Alibaba to raise more than $15bn. ",

AXA UK said on Wednesday that the AstraZeneca board \"should not prevent an offer\" from being put to shareholders. AstraZeneca's board turned down the \u00a355-a-share offer this week.  UK takeover rules mean Pfizer's offer will expire on Monday. Jim Stride, head of UK equities at AXA Investment Managers, said: \"We believe that the board was arguably wrong and acted too hastily to dismiss the latest proposal from Pfizer.\"  AXA Investment Managers holds just under 1% of AstraZeneca's stock.  Two other institutional shareholders, Schroders and Jupiter Fund Management, have also expressed disappointment with the decision. And there was an unconfirmed report in the Wall Street Journal that Legal & General would also like AstraZeneca to rethink its rejection. The news pushed AstraZeneca shares 2.59% higher on hopes that Pfizer may return with a higher offer. However, other shareholders - including Threadneedle, Woodford Investment Management, Aberdeen Asset Management, and M&G Investments - support an independent AstraZeneca. Pfizer had planned to create the world's largest drug company, with its headquarters in New York, but based in the UK for tax purposes.  AstraZeneca chairman Leif Johansson had said that Pfizer's pursuit had been \"fundamentally driven\" by the corporate financial benefits. ",

        "article": "BP has appealed to the US Supreme Court over a ruling regarding how businesses must be compensated in the wake of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. On Monday, a court re-affirmed the oil giant must pay some businesses economic damages whether or not they can prove the spill caused losses.  The ruling was seen as a blow to BP's attempt to limit the costs of settling claims. BP initially estimated it would pay $7.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in business claims. The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig, off the coast of Louisiana, killed 11 workers and caused the worst offshore oil spill in US history.  In the wake of that disaster, BP reached the terms of a settlement to compensate businesses.  But the oil company has argued that the terms are being misinterpreted and that it would face paying compensation for false claims. \"No company would agree to pay for losses that it did not cause, and BP certainly did not when it entered into this settlement,\" BP said in a statement. BP has previously said that unwarranted claims include a company that had a fire unconnected to the oil spill, and another business that closed before the disaster. However, in Monday's ruling, a judge said BP knew the terms of the settlement to which it had agreed. Judge Leslie Southwick stated that a 2012 policy statement, issued by the court-appointed claims administrator and developed with \"input and assent from BP,\" clearly spelled out the criteria for business compensation claims. Mr Southwick said all parties agreed to the relevant criteria, before court approval of that 2012 settlement deal. ",

Sales in the Americas, its biggest market, rose 8% to $439m, as its increasing focus on lower-priced jewellery attracted customers. Global net sales grew 13% to $1bn, up from $895.5m a year earlier. That beat analysts expectations for sales of $953.7m in the first quarter   Regionally, sales were 17% higher in Asia Pacific, 20% higher in Japan and 9% in Europe. Tiffany, which is known for its turquoise gift boxes, also boosted its earnings outlook for 2014.  The company  has been struggling for the past two years to find the right balance between the expensive jewellery, for which it is better known, and cheaper silver items that generate a quarter of sales. Tiffany chief executive Michael Kowalski said: \"This is an excellent and encouraging start to the year.\"  He also said that strength in fine and statement jewellery sales continued, while sales of Tiffany's new or expanded jewellery collections accelerated, led by its Atlas collection. The Atlas Collection is a new range that focuses on silver jewellery - including lariats, rings and pendants - priced below $500.

        "article": "A third of students in England, who pay up to \u00a39,000 in tuition fees, say their degree course is poor or very poor value for money, a study indicates.   A survey of 15,046 UK students found they have just 10 minutes extra with university lecturers despite the rise - for the majority - in fees since 2012. The findings are revealed by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and the Higher Education Academy (HEA). The government said students, \"quite rightly\", had higher expectations. Higher tuition fees in England mean undergraduates currently in the first or second year of university study are paying up to \u00a39,000 a year. The Hepi and HEA research found today's students in England  were more likely to say their course was poor value compared to 2012 - before the fee hike. One third of current first- and second-year students (33%) said they were receiving poor or very poor value for money, compared with 18% in 2012. And just 36% of these students thought their course represented good value for money, compared with 52% in 2012.   But the study found  students in Scotland were more likely to say their course was worth the money, with  70% of those at Scottish universities rating their course as good or very value. However, Scottish students pay no tuition fees, if they study at a university in Scotland.  The Hepi/HEA report says regional differences in perceptions of value for money are \"not unexpected given that Scottish and other EU-domiciled students from outside the UK, who constitute the vast majority of students at Scottish institutions, effectively pay no fees\". When asked what their top three priorities would be for institutional expenditure, 48% of UK students polled said \"reducing fee levels\", followed by having more teaching hours and reducing the size of teaching groups (both 35%). The survey also found 31% said they would definitely or maybe have chosen another course if they were to have their time again. The survey found that in the first and second years of their degree, undergraduates have an average of 14.2 hours of \"contact\" time - for example time spent in lectures and seminars, and spend another 14.3 hours on average in private study. This is much less than the 40 hours a week of study suggested in the Quality Assurance Agency's (QAA) guidelines, the report said. The findings show students do not attend about 9% of lectures and seminars laid on by their university, with the most common reasons for absence  being that undergraduates did not find the lectures very useful and that the notes were available online. Universities minister David Willetts said: \"Young people are more serious about their education than ever before. Universities need to raise their game [...] I don't think universities are worse, but students have higher expectations, quite rightly.\" Mr Willetts  said institutions would now have to do \"far better\" than simply offering lectures with 500 students sitting in a room taking notes from slides on a screen. He added: \"The days where the academic experience is simply sitting in rows with 500 other people taking notes from slides on a screen that you can access online on your laptop, universities now have to do far better than that.\" Nick Hillman, director of Hepi, said: \"The data suggest growing differences across the UK. Students in Scotland generally think they are getting good value for money.  \"Meanwhile, students in England are paying much more but receiving only a little more. In England, one in three students say they are getting poor value for money - nearly twice as high as before the \u00a39,000 fees were introduced. \"In this election year, students should press all the political parties to say what they will do to encourage universities to offer world-class teaching alongside their world-class research.\" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \"The increase in fees in England and the shift away from public funding to higher graduate contributions means that students are clearly demanding more from their courses.  \"The important thing is ensuring that students have enough information about their courses and that the experience matches their expectations. \"Due to the quality of its degrees, the UK has one the strongest and most highly respected higher education systems in the world.\" Sonia Sodha, head of public services policy at the consumer magazine Which?, said: \"A key problem is a lack of information that makes it difficult for students to make a fully informed choice. We want better data to be included in the key information set such as the amount and type of scheduled teaching.\" ",

The sports presenter invested thousands into Icebreaker, a company which purported to support young musicians. However, a recent court ruling said the firm was \"understood by all concerned to be a tax avoidance scheme\". Logan says she invested in the scheme in \"good faith\" and vowed \"to pay any tax\" she owes. She added that she pulled out of the scheme in 2012. \"I have been completely open and honest with HMRC and I have never hidden anything\u201d Logan issued the following statement  , following press speculation about her involvement in the scheme. \"I was advised about a business opportunity six years ago (2008) and I invested in good faith.  \"It was explained to me as a way of funding new acts in the music industry. Because of information which came to light in 2012, I decided the investment was not right for me.  \"With new professional help and advisors, I have for some time been working to resolve the issue and I fully intend to pay any tax which should have been paid, had I not entered the business. The presenter said she had been \"completely open and honest\" with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), adding: \"I have never hidden anything.\" Take That singer Gary Barlow - along with band-mates Howard Donald and Mark Owen, and manager Jonathan Wild - were among about 1,000 people who put money into the Icebreaker scheme. Since March 2010, the four men have been directors of Larkdale LLP - one of 50 partnerships that Icebreaker arranged to harness tax reliefs that the government had intended would support those in creative industries. The tribunal found that shortly after money was put in to Larkdale LLP, it reported huge losses of more than \u00a325m. Those losses could then be offset against tax, reducing the men's tax bills. In total, around 50 partnerships with hundreds of members invested in Icebreaker, which claimed total losses of \u00a3336m. Last week, former Olympic hurdler and BBC broadcaster Colin Jackson admitted to being in one such partnership, Sparkdale LLP, along with a number of dentists and lawyers. He defended his decision to invest in the loss-making scheme,   he was proud to have supported struggling musicians.  \"If it means you have to take a hit then I'll happily take a hit,\" he said. \"People have invested in me in the past to help me get to the top of my game. I'll still invest in people to help them get to the top of their game.\" HMRC pursued Icebreaker through the courts after the Times newspaper first exposed the scheme in 2012. Its members have until 2 July to decide whether they want to appeal. HMRC said it would be seeking payment of the tax in the meantime. ",

        "article": "Thousands of letters are to be sent to single parents in Britain informing them of changes to their child maintenance arrangements. The government wants parents to agree their child maintenance agreements \"amicably\" or face a charge. It said the changes were necessary as the old set-up was costly for taxpayers. But a charity said the changes could force some parents into \"unstable\" arrangements. Child maintenance is financial support that helps towards a child's living costs when its parents have separated. If parents split, maintenance should be paid to the person who takes care of the child on a day-to-day basis. Under the old system many single parents used the Child Support Agency (CSA) to sort out maintenance payments, but ministers  . A government spokesman said the old CSA was using an IT system that was \"totally inadequate and notoriously riddled with defects\", and as such it was costing \u00a374 million per annum to run in operating costs alone. The spokesman added that the old maintenance system \"took responsibility away from parents, encouraging conflict and hostility at huge expense to the taxpayer\". In an effort to improve the situation the new replacement \"Child Maintenance Service\" has been gradually rolled out, which the government said is designed to act as a backstop for parents having trouble. This week more than 50,000 letters are being sent out by the Department for Work and Pensions to parents in England, Scotland and Wales who currently pay and receive child maintenance through the old CSA.  Ministers want to encourage people to come to voluntary arrangements but if that is not possible - and the new statutory service is used - then both parties will be charged.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Under the new rules if an amicable arrangement cannot be reached the paying parent - usually the father - will have a 20% fee added to the maintenance payment, while the receiving parent will pay 4% to get the money. The charges will be introduced later this year, and all single parents will be charged an upfront fee of \u00a320 for registering with the new service. However, the chief executive of the single-parent charity Gingerbread, Fiona Weir, said she was \"concerned\" by the reforms. She said: \"While many parents are able to agree private child maintenance arrangements, for many other parents, this just isn't possible without government help.  \"We're very concerned that closing CSA cases and bringing in charges may deter some parents from making new child maintenance agreements or pressure single parents into unstable arrangements, and children will lose out on vital support.\" For further help and assistance with child maintenance parents can visit  .

        "article": "UK house prices rose by 8% in the year to the end of March, official figures show, as the prime minister says he will consider changes to Help to Buy. The annual increase slowed compared with a 9.2% year-on-year price rise to the end of February. However, the latest official data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that the annual property price increase in London stood at 17%. Excluding London and the South East of England, prices were up by 4.7%.  The wide range of activity was shown with prices in Northern Ireland increasing by 0.3% on a year-on-year basis, and by 0.8% in Scotland. In the East of England, property prices were up by 6.6% annually, and by 6.1% in the South East of England. The ONS said that prices fell by 0.5% in March compared with February, matching other surveys, making the average home worth \u00a3252,000. This was the first month-on-month drop for over a year. However, house price data from the Halifax and Nationwide, based on their lending, have also shown fairly sharp rises in prices on average over the last year, despite the regional differences. This has prompted some commentators to call for the second phase of the government-backed Help to Buy scheme in the UK - which supports new homebuyers who might have struggled to get a mortgage - to be scaled back. Prime Minister David Cameron told the BBC: \"Of course, we will consider any changes that are proposed by [Bank of England governor] Mark Carney. An unaddressed bubble in London will pump up bubbles in adjacent regions, as buyers feel compelled to look for value and affordability elsewhere\u201d \"But, as he said, this is a well-targeted scheme and it has helped tens of thousands of people get on the housing ladder and to have mortgages.\" The shadow chancellor, Ed  Balls, said the Help to Buy scheme was simply too high: \"We've said it should come down much closer to average house prices. A number below \u00a3400,000 would make much more sense than \u00a3600,000 which is far too big a house price for the taxpayer to be guaranteeing mortgages. \" The Treasury minister - Andrea Leadsom - said there were a number of issues for the government to consider: \"The thing is it's a fine balance. In London prices are rising quite fast. In the rest of the country - and in the country as a whole - they remain 15% in real terms below their pre-crisis peak. \" Mr Carney said he was watching the housing market closely. Although there was a shortage of homes, which the Bank could do nothing about, it did have influence on lenders and would tell the chancellor if changes needed to be made to the government's housing market schemes.  Mortgage rules have been altered recently, that is thought to be lengthening the time it takes to get a home loan. This has reduced the number of mortgage approvals in recent weeks.  The Bank of England also has the power to control interest rates, and a separate report suggests a rise in the Bank rate could hit hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders hard. The Resolution Foundation estimates that 770,000 vulnerable households could be \"imprisoned\" by a limited ability to switch to another mortgage deal were interest rates to rise. That represents about one in 10 mortgage holders in the UK. The Bank rate is at a record low of 0.5%, but analysts are predicting a rise in the rate at some point in 2015. \"Many borrowers have enjoyed spectacular savings over recent years, with mortgage rates falling to historic lows, and most will be able to ride the tide of gradually rising interest rates,\" said Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation and author of the report. \"But for around one in four, even modest rate rises could create financial difficulties. Those at greatest risk are members of this group who also find themselves unable to access the best deals in the market today.  \"Almost one in 10 households are doubly exposed: facing the prospect of their mortgage becoming increasingly unaffordable in the future and with the market offering them limited, if any, choice today.\" The report suggested that homeowners in London and eastern England were most exposed to an interest rate rise. The cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, rose to 1.8% in April from 1.6% in March. This was the first rise in inflation for 10 months and pushed the annual change in prices slightly higher than the annual change in average earnings. Alternatively, you can use the form below.

The authors of a petition to the Scottish Parliament say players under the age of 16 are not allowed to change club without compensation being paid. They argue this \"transfer market\" breaches Scots law and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The issue will be discussed at the  . Among those scheduled to take part is Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster. He will be joined by Andrew McKinlay of the Scottish Football Association, Heart of Midlothian's director of football John Murray, and lawyer Malcolm McGregor. The   petition was lodged at the parliament four years ago by William Smith and Scott Robertson of the Real Grassroots campaign. The pair have been involved in boys club football for many years, and have been credited with helping to discover and develop some of the country's best young players. The Scottish government should seriously consider suspending funding (direct or indirect) to clubs pending an independent review\u201d Their petition states that one-year registration forms given by professional clubs to 15-year-olds are in effect contracts, which restricts the ability of the player to change club for the following three years. Mr Smith and Mr Robertson have argued that this breaches the Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991 and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. They have also claimed that clubs were sometimes paying more than the stipulated compensation amounts set out by the football authorities to sign young players from another club. This effectively creates a transfer market in child footballers, they have alleged. The claim was backed at a previous meeting of the petitions committee by Rangers youth coach Jim Sinclair, who said: \"In our experience, the whole thing can turn into a transfer market or end up in a bartering situation if, despite the fact that the level of compensation is actually X, the club with the player demands X plus Y.\" He described the practice as \"reprehensible\". Mr Smith and Mr Robertson have said the current system was having an \"adverse effect\" on young players, and have called for it to be abolished. But they have claimed that there is \"no appetite\" for the football authorities to address breaches of the rules committed by their member clubs. Among the proposals they have made are: In a letter to the committee ahead of the meeting, Mr Smith and Mr Robertson said: \"Every year a significant amount of public money is provided to Scotland's professional clubs and it is given in the spirit and hope that this money will be used to better our national game for youngsters.  \"Whilst the unfair issues we highlight continue and potential breaches in Scots and European legislation exist, the Scottish government should seriously consider suspending funding (direct or indirect) to clubs pending an independent review.  \"The challenge for Real Grassroots and the Public Petition Committee has always been to change the poor practices of our senior clubs and stand up for young players who have and continue to be mistreated by a system that ensures all control is in the hands of professional football clubs.\" Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People has also previously called for compensation payments for young players moving between clubs to be \"abolished immediately\" on the grounds that they are \"overly restrictive and unfair\". The payments are designed to compensate clubs for the money they have invested in training and developing a young player who wishes to move to another club. Earlier this year, SPFL clubs agreed changes to the compensation scheme following recommendations made by a working party chaired by SFA president Campbell Ogilvie. The working party concluded that FIFA regulations \"clearly permit\" football associations to adopt a system for the financial reward of clubs investing in the training and education of young players.  It also said the Scottish FA youth development programme Club Academy Scotland provided \"the most suitable vehicle to introduce a uniform, fair and consistent mechanism for the reimbursement of youth training costs.\" The Public Petitions Committee can be watched live, or later on demand, at  .

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Bosses discuss the challenge of expanding internationally The leaders of firms seeking global success would do well to heed Aesop's fable of the race between the hare and the slow-moving - but ultimate winner - the tortoise. Similarly in the global race for growth, it is businesses who are prepared to play the long game that will win. When Stefano Pessina tried to secure Alliance Boots' first deal in China it was not a matter of simply agreeing terms and then signing the relevant documents. In fact, it took years of analysis and discussions before executive chairman Mr Pessina was even in a position to try to negotiate terms. Eventually in 2005, Alliance Boots secured an agreement to take a 50% stake in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals, one of China's largest drug wholesalers. But even after this, it took a further two-and-a-half years to get the deal approved by all the relevant authorities. In 2012 it did its second China deal - buying a minority stake in Nanjing Pharmaceutical - but final regulatory approval of this deal is still pending. This is the reality of doing business in China - it takes a very long time, much longer than similar deals in the West, says Mr Pessina. \"When you approach China, you have to approach it with a mindset which is slightly different. You have to be prepared to live in a different world. You have to be even more flexible than you have to be when working in the Western world.\" Mr Pessina says the Chinese think much longer term compared with those in the West, and he says they also tend to change their mind frequently. He wants Alliance Boots, via further tie-ups with local partners, to become a major player in China so that it can benefit from its rapid rate of growth, but says it will take at least five years to fulfil this ambition. The fact that Alliance Boots is a private company makes it easier to carry out these kind of long-term deals. But for publicly listed firms, which have to report results to investors every three months, it can be a hard sell. Leadership expert Steve Tappin says companies are often tempted by a \"quick fix\", for example selling the same product or service worldwide, rather than adapting them for local markets. \"The best business leaders shun this approach. They understand it takes time to build lasting relationships, particularly in cultures that are different to their own,\" he says. Online auction site eBay learned the hard way. In 2006 it shut down its main website in China just two years after its launch, having failed to make headway against local rivals. Instead it formed   with a local partner to help operate an online auction business in the country. Critics say it failed to recognise that having a strong US brand would not automatically translate in China. Current chief executive John Donahoe, who was not at the helm during the firm's first foray into China, says the experience taught eBay to follow consumer trends, rather than try to create them. In China it has since focused on helping customers to sell goods as it discovered that was where the interest lay. In Russia, on the other hand, demand to buy goods via eBay is high, so the company has concentrated on making the buying process easier. \"We treat each market a little bit differently. They're all connected in a common technology platform, but balancing that local ownership, while also being part of a global technology platform, that's what we're trying to do,\" says Mr Donahoe. Despite the hurdles, there are clearly vast benefits that come from global expansion.  When Jeff Immelt, chief executive of US giant General Electric (GE), took the helm over a decade ago, some 70% of its operations were in the US. Now it operates in more than 160 countries and more than half of its revenues come from overseas. For him, targeting deals in developing countries is a top priority because their rate of growth vastly outpaces that of the US and he says GE will never be so US-focused again \"unless we are failing horribly\". \"I sit in my office every day and say I've got to have higher market share in China than I have in the United States,\" he says. \"I've got to win Brazil, I've got to win Africa. There's no choice. I've got to, I've got to win those countries.\" ",

        "article": "Higher fares for flights and ferries helped to push the rate of inflation up in April, the first increase in the rate for 10 months. The Consumer Prices Index, rose to 1.8% in April from 1.6% in March,  The ONS said the timing of Easter, which fell in April this year, was likely to have had an impact on travel costs. It said the cost of petrol was also higher than the same month a year ago.  You've probably noticed that flights and ferries get more expensive around holiday times, but that effect is particularly noticeable in these figures. Inflation had been falling since last June (except for one unchanged month) and most of the categories were down again in April.  But the transport category pushed overall annual inflation up 0.4 percentage points all by itself, reflecting an 18% monthly rise in air fares and 22% rise in sea fares. Why such a difference? Because last year Easter Sunday was at the end of March while this year it was in mid-April, and that pushed flight and ferry costs up so much that it negated all other effects.  The increase in travel and fuel costs were offset to some extent by a fall in the cost of food. April's rise in the CPI rate suggests that the cost of living is once again increasing faster than wage rises. The most recent figures on earnings showed that they rose at an annual rate of 1.7% in the three months to March.  However, Ben Brettell, economics editor at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said he still expected wages to outpace inflation in the long term.  \"It looks like we could see a period of modest real wage growth with wages increasing marginally faster than prices over the next year or so.\" The rate of inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) was unchanged at 2.5%, the ONS said. Despite the increase in the CPI inflation measure, the rate is still below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said he expected the rate of inflation to remain below its target for the next two years. Capital Economics economist Samuel Tombs said the rise in the rate was \"a blip\" due to the timing of Easter. \"We continue to think that Consumer Price inflation should ease to as low as 1% by the end of this year and remain comfortably below the 2% target in 2015,\" he said.

        "article": "Reeling from a run - the first on a British bank for more than a century - and nationalisation soon after, the state of Northern Rock was mirrored by its Sunderland offices. The sparsely populated premises at Doxford Business Park had fallen into such a poor condition that part of the roof would eventually blow off. Now, the building has been renovated into the sleek, open-plan nerve centre of UK Asset Resolution (Ukar) - the Treasury-owned company that has the job of running down the rump of the Rock. Those in charge believe that the state-of-the-art, largely transparent customer operations centre reflects the way in which the business is now run, albeit with very different ambitions. Ukar oversees the shaky side of the mortgage books of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley - the parts of the banks that could not be sold off to the likes of Virgin. Its job is not to offer new home loans but to run down those old, riskier deals while keeping a roof over mortgage-holders' heads when possible. But the boss, chief executive Richard Banks, doesn't like the phrase \"bad bank\". Only 5% of mortgage customers - nearly 30,000 people - are in arrears with mortgage repayments, a figure that is falling. The Treasury is steadily being paid back, with the announcement of further loan repayments to government expected imminently. It is not a household name. When asked, some customers thought Ukar (pronounced U-kar) was a motor dealership. In fact, letters to customers are headed with the names of the specific lenders - Northern Rock Asset Management, Bradford & Bingley or Mortgage Express. Yet, the decisions it makes affect the homes and day-to-day finances of nearly half a million people, many of whom stretched themselves almost to breaking point during the housing boom prior 2008.  Amit Rao, 32, is typical. He bought a one-bedroom flat in Watford at a time when he says lenders were \"handing mortgages out like Smarties\". He signed up to Northern Rock's Together mortgage, which was popular before the credit crunch and allowed homebuyers to borrow the full price of the property plus an unsecured loan on top. \"I thought it was wise to invest, and that you couldn't go wrong with property,\" he says. But things did go wrong for him. The bank collapsed and had to be rescued by government, the value of his property fell, and his job moved further away from home. Northern Rock Asset Management can no longer offer fixed-rate deals, so when his deal expired he had to move to the Rock's more expensive standard variable rate (SVR). No other lenders were willing to take him on. This is common among Northern Rock Asset Management mortgage holders. Nine out of 10 of them are on the SVR of 4.79%. Mr Rao moved back in with his parents to cut his costs. Eventually he changed the conditions of the mortgage so he could rent the flat out to tenants, but the rent he gets in does not cover the mortgage repayments. The property is still worth less than his outstanding mortgage - known as negative equity - and he feels stuck. \"I can't really move on with my life,\" he says. \"My biggest fear is that interest rates go up soon, and rise to a level that I can't sustain repayments.\" He says he would welcome some guidance and communication from the lender, explaining his options. Ukar says that it can help customers in this situation review their monthly incomings and outgoings and may put borrowers in touch with independent mortgages brokers who could help find a new fixed-rate deal with another lender.  Yet, chief executive Mr Banks points out: \"It is not our job to be a social service.\" Still, he admits he worries about the effect that an interest rate rise would have on customers, predicting the first increase in the Bank rate to come early in 2015. He says that 25% of their mortgage customers could face serious difficulties in making mortgage repayments were the Bank rate to rise to 5%. It is currently at a record low of 0.5%. Meanwhile, there will always be those who face money problems as a result of redundancy or marital breakdown, he says, who will start getting behind on their bills. Customers who miss a mortgage repayment can expect a phone call within two days. Text messages and letters may follow. But, says Jim Waddell - Ukar's head of customer assistance, this is not a debt collection call, but an attempt to prevent any problems spiralling out of control. A huge banner hanging from the ceiling above his team displays the phone number of the National Debtline, aimed at encouraging those struggling with debts to get help from the charity in drawing up a repayment plan. Elsewhere in the Sunderland complex, calls have been made to prevent more long-term debt troubles. Every customer with an interest-only mortgage deal, where the term will end and the final lump sum will be due within 10 years, received letters asking how the borrower intends to pay off the balance. Every lender has done something similar, following an agreement with the regulator, but only for those with terms ending by 2020. From September, those with interest-only deals where the balance is due in more than 10 years' time, will also start to receive letters from Ukar asking about their financial plans.  Mr Banks, whose career included director level positions at Alliance and Leicester, says that it is refreshing - but unusual - to be a mortgage lender who does not have to worry about sales. His job, and his target, within the next 10 years is to pay back the \u00a350bn or so of government loans that it needed to start the job of running down a book of 553,853 home loans worth \u00a362.3bn. The more successful Ukar is at running down the mortgage book, the quicker the organisation will disappear, which makes staff motivation a challenge. But, for now, Mr Banks - a DIY enthusiast - and his staff take pride in having \"put together and repaired\" two broken bits of the UK banking system, Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley. \"It is testament to what skilled operators our staff have to be. They have to be behavioural psychologists while obeying the rules,\" he says. Ultimately, their success will depend on whether - like the refurbished offices in Sunderland - they can keep a roof over their customers' heads.  ",

        "article": "There was a time when a strongly worded letter was the only means of having your complaint heard by a company, but is tweeting now the best way to get your gripe to the front of the queue? When Angie Konrad tweeted that the heating was switched off on her train, she did not expect the operators of that line to read the message and alert the driver to switch the heating on so she could enjoy the rest of her journey in comfort. Twitter is enabling companies to engage in a much warmer relationship with their clientele, but when things go wrong for the customer, it is also the best way to get grievances resolved quickly and in real time says comedian David Schneider, who is also a Twitter expert and runs social media consultancy That Lot. \"If you're 29th in the queue on a phone call, only you know that. It's you and the person who's keeping you on hold. But if you tweet, it's public and it could be picked up, and I think companies are very aware of that,\" says Mr Schneider. A bad review or negative comment can be retweeted by millions, and companies are often keen to defuse customer anger very quickly in a public space such as Twitter. If it is done cleverly, it can even work in a company's favour. \"I remember there was a time where there was an outage on O2 on the network and they were getting a hell of a lot of bad press,\" says Mr Schneider. \"People were tweeting very aggressively at the O2 account and about O2 - it was trending. \"They happened to have a very skilful, self-deprecating, humorous person on their Twitter feed at that time who dealt with the abuse in a very amusing way.\" Mr Schneider says it was interesting to see a wave of criticism turn to positive comments from the customers.  When a complaint is treated with a personal touch, it can even go viral on Twitter. For instance one Argos customer service representative chose to reply to customer Immy \"Badman\" Bugti's complaint   he had used in his tweet. A shortened version of the messages read: \"@Argos_online: Yo, wen you gettin' da ps4 tings in moss side? Ain't waitin' no more.\" \"@BadManBugti: Safe Badman. We gettin' sum more PS4 tings in wivin da next week, y'get me.\" The company response from Argos was retweeted over 1,500 times within the space of a few hours. Jo Causon, chief executive of the Institute of Customer Service, says consumers are becoming much more savvy and expect organisations to relate to them as real life human beings and not simply transactions any more. \"One of the key things that we're seeing in the changing world we're all living in is that we want to have better dialogue, not just monologue, with our organisations,\" says Ms Causon.  According to a poll of 2,000 people by the communications agency Fishburn Hedges and Echo Research in April 2012,   to contact a big company and 65% said it was a better way than call centres to get in touch with companies. It was not just confined to the young either, with 27% of people aged over 55 having used social media to complain. Ms Causon expects complaints via Twitter to only increase in popularity with the growth of social media. \"A lot of us at the moment are not complaining necessarily through Twitter, but as we progress, it certainly is a medium of choice, and organisations will need to be able to respond appropriately,\" says Ms Causon. With almost 15,000 complaints a day about financial services in 2013, according to  , Hannah Moore from BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme monitored the Twitter feeds of eight of the major banks for a working day and found problems were not necessarily resolved on Twitter, but it did help push requests to the front of the queue. \"When customers complained about hanging on premium rate phonelines, [some] staff promised to call them instead, and if you're confused about which department you need to get in touch with, Twitter's really helpful,\" she says. \"The best banks provided the correct phone numbers, forms and web links within minutes - again saving you time on an 0845 number.\" According to Ms Causon it's important for the consumer to be responsible about choosing the right channel for their complaint too. \"A banking problem in itself doesn't necessarily lend itself to a very public place like Twitter, so I think it's about the nature of the problem and what you're looking to have resolved.\" If Twitter is making it easier to complain, it also makes it easier for consumers to give positive feedback to companies too, so there is no danger we will turn into a nation of whingers.

        "article": "The maths skills of teenagers in parts of the deep south of the United States are worse than in countries such as Turkey and barely above countries such as Chile and Mexico. An international study of maths ability in the US shows how individual states would have performed if they were ranked against other countries, using the OECD's Pisa results as a benchmark. The study also shows that  . This analysis, from academics at Harvard and Stanford in the US and Munich University in Germany, punctures the idea that middle-class US pupils are high achievers. Southern states Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are among the weakest performers, with results similar to developing countries such as Kazakhstan and Thailand. West Virginia is also among the group of lowest performers, where maths levels are far below western European countries or high-performing Asian education systems in South Korea or Singapore. The US has been a mediocre performer in international education tests, based on average performance across the country, but this study shows how this average conceals a remarkably wide range of successes and failures. There is a band of high achieving states across the north of the US, where maths results would be as good as many successful European and Asian countries. If Massachusetts had been considered as a separate entity it would have been the seventh best at maths in the world.  Minnesota, Vermont, New Jersey and Montana are all high performers. But there is a long tail of underachievement that dips well below the levels of secondary school pupils in wealthier western European countries. It dips into levels closer to the developing world. New York and California are similar in ability to countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, well below the averages for the US and OECD industrialised countries. There are 23 US states which would be ranked below 30th place in an international ranking of 34 OECD countries at maths. The study also overturns the idea that middle-class children in the US are as good as their international counterparts. It shows that in the US, as in other countries, children from better educated, wealthier families will achieve better results than poorer children. Among children of parents with a low level of education, only 17% were proficient in maths, compared with 43% of children from well-educated families. But this standard of maths among well-educated families in US is well below their counterparts in other countries. In Poland, 71% of children from well-educated families were likely to be proficient in maths. In Germany, 64% of better-off children were proficient at maths and 55% in France. There is a denial phenomenon\u201d Even such a poor performance was unlikely to set off alarm bells, said Paul Peterson, report co-author and professor of government at Harvard University and director of the Program on Education Policy and Governance at the Harvard Kennedy School. \"There is a denial phenomenon,\" says Prof Peterson. He said the tendency to make internal comparisons between different groups within the US had shielded the country from recognising how much they are being overtaken by international rivals. \"The American public has been trained to think about white versus minority, urban versus suburban, rich versus poor,\" he said. The outcome was a misleading sense of complacency about middle-class education, which always appeared to be ahead, he said. Report authors, Prof Peterson, Eric Hanushek at Stanford University and Ludger Woessmann at the University of Munich, wrote in Education Next magazine: \"Lacking good information, it has been easy even for sophisticated Americans to be seduced by apologists who would have the public believe the problems are simply those of poor kids in central city schools. \" \"Our results point in quite the opposite direction,\" . The underachievement in some southern states was a reflection of deep-rooted historical divides and disadvantages, Prof Peterson said, such as slavery and segregation. But the study raises questions about how other southern states can buck the trend, such as Texas. Among the children of poorly educated families, Texas is a spectacularly strong performer, equivalent to sixth place in the OECD rankings, just behind Finland.  California raised another set of negative questions, said Prof Peterson, with a very low performance. \"California was historically thought to have a good education system, but it's plunged since the 1970s,\" he said. It has an economy big enough to match many OECD countries, but in education comparisons it would be a lightweight, its maths performance weaker than in almost any other industrialised country. \"It's where the rubber hits the road,\" said Prof Peterson.   There were long-term implications from all this, he said. Industries were concentrating around areas with successful education systems. And success in education was linked to healthier and wealthier lives for individuals. Rebecca Winthrop, director for the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, said the findings would \"raise eyebrows\". In particular, she thought it would be a wake-up call for well-educated parents who thought that worries about education were a problem for \"other people's children\". But she said it was important to remember the great size of the country - and that even getting down to state level there were still huge underlying disparities and inequalities. \"California is in itself a huge place,\" she said. And any aggregate results are going to hide the gulf between schools serving the Silicon Valley super rich and the migrant poor. Andreas Schleicher, responsible for the OECD's Pisa tests, said this study was a challenge to middle-class households who thought that debates about school standards did not apply to them. \"The general perception has typically been that this is mainly a concern around poor schools in poor neighbourhoods and so middle-class families have often not been particularly engaged in this,\" he said. In the short term, he said, the US economy would be insulated against this underachievement because it still had a \"strong skill base, simply because it was the first economy investing in universal education in the 1960s, and those people still make up a large part of the workforce\". But this legacy would not last forever.  \"As time goes by, skill gaps will become increasingly apparent,\" he said. The report authors conclude that as well as focusing on the gap between rich and poor, the US needs to pay more attention to the rear lights of their international rivals as they race away ahead of them. 1.
