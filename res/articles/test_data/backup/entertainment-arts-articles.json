Nirvana were among the acts inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Grunge band Nirvana have been enlisted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, alongside the likes of Kiss and Beatles manager Brian Epstein. REM's Michael Stipe inducted the group, saying: \"Nirvana tapped into a voice that was yearning to be heard.  \"Nirvana were kicking against the mainstream. They spoke truth and a lot of people listened.\"  Nirvana fans walk up to me every day and say thank you for the music\u201d The band's career was cut short by Kurt Cobain's death in 1994. His widow, Courtney Love, attended the ceremony. \"You know, I have a big speech, but I'm not going to say it,\" she said, before hugging Cobain's bandmates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl. \"That's it,\" she concluded. \"I just wish Kurt was here to do this.\" Grohl, Nirvana's drummer and now frontman of rock group Foo Fighters, paid tribute to the musicians who formed the early line-ups of Nirvana, in particular drummer Chad Channing, who he singled out for his contributions to the band's breakthrough album Nevermind. Bass guitarist Novoselic added: \"Nirvana fans walk up to me every day and say thank you for the music. \"When I hear that, I think of Kurt Cobain.\" Nirvana received their place in the Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. Artists can only be considered for the honour 25 years after their first release. The remaining members, also including guitarist Pat Smear, were joined on stage by four female musicians to perform some of the band's best-known songs. Joan Jett sang Smells Like Teen Spirit, Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon took on Aneurysm, alternative musician St. Vincent performed Lithium, while New Zealand pop star Lorde sang All Apologies. Other honourees at the New York ceremony included Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, 15 years after their leader was inducted as a solo artist. He welcomed the band on stage, saying: \"I told a story with the E Street Band that was, and is, bigger than anything I could have told on my own.\"  \"We suffered ageing, illness and death together,\" Springsteen said. \"We took care of each other when trouble knocked, and we hurt each other in big and small ways. In the end, we stuck with each other.\" Their induction took 85 minutes, including performances of The E Street Shuffle, The River and Kitty's Back. They were followed into the Hall of Fame by Maneater singers Daryl Hall and John Oates.  \"Lucky for you, there are only two of us,\" Hall said to laughter from the audience.  Britain's Peter Gabriel was inducted by Coldplay singer Chris Martin, and made light of his elaborate stage outfits as a member of Genesis in the 1970s. \"Dream big, and let your imagination guide you, even if you end up dressing as a flower or a sexually transmitted disease.\" Another British honouree was Cat Stevens, whose hits included Matthew and Son and Wild World. \"Thanks so much to my fans for believing,\" said Stevens, who gave up music for 25 years after converting to Islam and changing his name to Yusuf Islam in 1977. \"I can still see some sceptical faces, but my fans believed.\" Rock legends Kiss were one of the more controversial inductees, having pulled out of a performance at the ceremony over a disagreement about their line-up. Famous for their elaborate stage make-up and costumes, the band wanted to play with their current line-up, including founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, causing friction with retired members Ace Frehley and Peter Criss. I think those people basically hijacked the name rock and roll\u201d But the quartet made peace and saluted each other in heartfelt induction speeches.  \"This is a pivotal moment for all of us,\" said Simmons, the bass player on hits like Crazy Nights and Rock and Roll All Nite.  \"We are humbled that the fans gave us the chance to do what we loved doing.\" Country queen Linda Ronstadt, who has Parkinson's disease, was unable to attend the ceremony, instead receiving a musical tribute from Carrie Underwood, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow and Stevie Nicks. Glenn Frey, who played in Ronstadt's band before joining the Eagles, led her induction with a glowing tribute to \"one of the greatest voices of all time\". \"Linda Ronstadt recorded 31 albums. She sold over 100 million records and had a career that spanned five decades,\" he said.  \"She has been a shining example and a true inspiration to every woman who ever stood in front of a microphone and sang her heart out.\" The ceremony also saw the first ever inductions for managers of rock bands, which went to the late Brian Epstein, who guided the Beatles to stardom, and Andrew Loog Oldham, who launched the careers of the Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart and Eric Clapton. However, the former Stones' manager boycotted the ceremony. \"I won't be there,\" he said at a  . \"I'll tell you why: It's a television show.  \"Twenty years ago, it was an incredible party in the Waldorf-Astoria where everybody could behave exactly as they could 20 years ago.  \"And then it became a business. I think those people basically hijacked the name 'rock and roll.'\" ",

Walters is being recognised for her contribution to film and TV, where she began partnering comedian Victoria Wood in shows such as Wood and Walters. She was Oscar-nominated for her turn, opposite Sir Michael Caine, in the 1983 film Educating Rita. \"I'm completely honoured and thrilled,\" the actress said. \"I got a letter just saying 'you've been chosen, would you accept it?'\" she told Chris Evans on his Radio 2 Breakfast show.  Media requires JavaScript to play. \"That was it. It was just like an email, and I emailed them back and said, 'yeah, great!'\" In a statement, she added she had \"worked with some brilliant people over the years\" and had been \"very fortunate to have had the opportunities to work on such a variety of projects\". Walters, who was made a CBE in 2008, originally trained as a nurse before studying English and drama and going to work for the Everyman Theatre Group in Liverpool, where her contemporaries included Bill Nighy and writer Alan Bleasdale. She played various minor roles before teaming up on TV with Woods, with whom she had previously appeared on stage. She gained international stardom with the comedy film Educating Rita, playing a working class woman who turns to academia to try and better her life. The film was nominated for three Oscars, though Walters - who won the Bafta and Golden Globe for best actress, lost out to Terms of Endearment's Shirley MacLaine on the night. Walters won another Bafta for best supporting actress in 2001 for the film Billy Elliot. She won the best actress category at the Bafta TV awards for three consecutive years between 2002 and 2004, for her roles in My Beautiful Son, Murder and Canterbury Tales. She was given the prize a fourth time in 2010 for her portrayal of former Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam. She recently starred in the BBC's Shakespeare series The Hollow Crown. Chief Executive of Bafta, Amanda Berry called Walters \"one the most talented individuals to grace our screens\". \"She has the innate ability,\" she added, \"to draw the viewer in across any genre, captivating and entertaining with every performance.  \"Julie is thoroughly deserving of the Fellowship, the highest honour the Academy can bestow.\" Walters will receive the award at this year's television Baftas at the Theatre Royal in London on 18 May. She said her speech would require \"a bit of thought\".  \"It's an award that's right at the end of the evening, so nobody wants a great big [speech] so I'm going to have to judge it carefully.\" Previous recipients include Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, Richard Curtis and Sir David Jason.

A judge in Los Angeles will decide on Friday whether the remains will be released to his estranged eighth wife or his lawyer, Michael Augustine. According to court documents, Rooney's most recent will, dated 11 March, left his modest estate to stepson Mark Aber. The actor had previously sued his other stepson, Christopher Aber, alleging elder abuse and fiscal mismanagement. Mark Aber - also known as Mark Rooney - and Christopher Aber are the sons of Janice Rooney, who Mickey Rooney married in 1978. The 93-year-old disinherited his wife and all his children in his last will, leaving his $18,000 (\u00a310,726) estate to Mark who had served, with his wife, as his caregiver. Michael Augustine was granted a court order on Tuesday preventing Janice Rooney from removing the actor's remains from a mortuary in Glendale, California. Rooney, a Hollywood legend whose film and musical career spanned nine decades, was no longer living with his wife at the time of his death from natural causes. The actor, loved by millions for his work in National Velvet and the Andy Hardy films, is survived by eight children as well as his two stepsons. He designated Augustine to serve as the executor of his estate, stating he did not want any of his relatives handling his affairs. In 2011, the actor testified before a US Senate committee that he had been emotionally and financially abused by family members. According to his lawyer, the actor owned a burial plot northwest of Los Angeles but had recently said he wanted to be buried in Hollywood or a veterans' cemetery. ",

The short but sweet note from Dylan Thomas to wife Caitlin, scribbled on the back of a bank stub, will be returned to Swansea thanks to \u00a3935,700 from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). The Dylan Thomas Centre is being expanded so more treasures can be seen. It is all part of the celebrations marking the centenary of his birth. The love letter is addressed to \"My darling own dear dear Cat\" and apologises that cheques the poet had sent her are late because work commitments prevented him from getting to the bank.  It was later sold by Thomas in 1941 to the University of Buffalo in New York. Money from the HLF will ensure that the new look exhibition will be opened in time to mark the centenary of Thomas' birthday in October. The grant will also allow the Grade II-listed building to show significantly more than 950 artefacts while an education and multimedia audio and video suite will also be created. Thomas' granddaughter Hannah Ellis, who has played a key role in the project, said: \"The centre is home to the largest collection of Dylan Thomas-related material in the world, a collection that provides a unique insight into who my grandfather truly was.  \"I want young and new audiences to be able to learn about and discover my grandfather's poems, his stories and his plays. This grant from the HLF will bring the exhibition into the 21st Century and open it up for future generations to enjoy.\"  The poet, whose work includes Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night and the play Under Milk Wood, died in 1953 aged 39. Former president of the United States Jimmy Carter, a devoted fan of Thomas, said: \"Dylan Thomas was one of the greatest poets of the past century and I have always felt an affinity to his poetry and literature. \"I have continuously advocated the importance of commemorating his life and work and having first opened this important centre in Swansea, it is great to see that this funding will ensure that the Dylan Thomas Centre can continue to thrive in years to come.\" ",

She has accused Duane Reade Inc of using a picture of her leaving one of its shops in promotional material. The case was filed in a court in Manhattan, New York, on Wednesday. Heigl is famous for her roles in films including Knocked Up and 27 Dresses and also won an Emmy for playing the character of Izzie Stevens in medical drama Grey's Anatomy. Duane Reade Inc is yet to give a statement in response. In documents submitted to the court, Heigl says she was recently photographed by paparazzi in New York City as she left a Duane Reade pharmacy.

        "article": "The BBC was \"far too complacent\" in its handling of a failed IT project that cost licence fee payers \u00a398.4m.  The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was intended to move the BBC away from using and storing video tape. But it was scrapped, with almost no results, after five years of development.  After investigating the demise of the project,  has branded the programme \"a complete failure\". Chairman Margaret Hodge said the BBC needed to \"overhaul\" its approach to such projects, to \"safeguard licence fee payers' money\". The BBC originally approved DMI in 2006. It was supposed to produce new editing tools, an online archive of the BBC's programmes and a new database. Technology company Siemens was hired to develop the project in February 2008, and it was expected to be completed the following year. However, after a series of delays, the project was brought in-house, There it floundered until last May, when the BBC's incoming director general, Tony Hall, admitted it had \"wasted a huge amount of licence fee payers' money\". The gross estimate of the amount spent on DMI was \u00a3125.9m, although the BBC claims to have recouped \u00a327.5m of that. The BBC's technology chief, John Linwood, was sacked in July 2013 over the project's demise. A previous report, by the National Audit Office (NAO), blamed \"confusion and a lack of planning\" for the failure. It said that senior executives failed to take control of the project when it ran into trouble and \"did not appear to appreciate the extent of the problems until a late stage\". The PAC published its own findings on Thursday. It reiterated several of the points raised in earlier reports and criticised the BBC for its failure to alert MPs of the problems. \"When my committee examined the DMI's progress in February 2011, the BBC told us that the DMI was... absolutely essential... and that a lot of the BBC's future was tied up in the successful delivery of the DMI,\" said Ms Hodge. \"The BBC also told us that it was using the DMI to make many programmes and was on track to complete the system in 2011 with no further delays.  \"This turned out not to be the case. In reality the BBC only ever used the DMI to make one programme, called Bang Goes the Theory. \"The BBC was far too complacent about the high risks involved in taking it in-house. No single individual had overall responsibility or accountability for delivering the DMI and achieving the benefits, or took ownership of problems when they arose.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"Tony Hall was right to scrap the DMI project when he took over as director general last year. As we said at the time, the BBC didn't get DMI right and we apologised to licence fee payers.  \"Since then we have completely overhauled how these projects are delivered so that there is crystal clear accountability and transparency.\" A spokeswoman for the BBC Trust, the corporation's governing body, said: \"As we have said before, this represented an unacceptable loss to licence fee payers. \"Acting on the conclusions of previous reports into DMI, we have strengthened reporting to the Trust so that problems are spotted early and dealt with quickly.  \"We are also carrying out follow up reviews once projects are completed to make sure the lessons from DMI are being implemented.\" ",

There's a moment on Tove Lo's debut EP that will take your breath away. It comes on the final track,  , where some bore is telling the Swedish singer \"time will heal\" her broken heart. Suddenly, the music vanishes into a black hole and Tove yells: \"Are you   me?\"   I once set another girl's hair on fire accidentally\u201d It's pained and bruised and thrilling and glorious. A moment where meaning and musical intent align perfectly. \"I've always wanted my music to have that desperation,\" the singer says, \"where you just want to strip your clothes off and run down the highway.\" \"I want the feeling where you don't really know what to do with yourself - in the vocals, in the production. Everything.\" The 26-year-old cut her teeth writing songs for Girls Aloud and fellow Swedes Icona Pop, but her solo material is altogether more visceral. Her Truth Serum EP is an unflinching document of a failed relationship. \"Not my first,\" she says, \"but certainly the most intense\". The key track is Habits, currently playlisted on Radio 1, and written in the immediate aftermath of the break-up. \"You're gone, and I've got to stay high all the time to keep you off my mind,\" she sings.   downing shots and hooking up with strangers, then crying uncontrollably in a nightclub toilet. \"When they heard it, my friends were like, 'Boy, you're really giving it all away',\" the singer says. \"For my family, I think it was harder. My mum gets a bit worried. \"She sent me a text: 'I can understand the new video gives a very honest perspective of the song, but I will never, ever watch it again.'\" Sadly for her mum, Habits - with its catalogue of bad decisions, bad boyfriends and banned substances - is all-too-real.  \"I can't lie,\" Tove says. \"What I'm singing about is my life. It's the truth.  \"I've had moments where that [drug-taking] has been a bigger part than it should be.  \"It's hard to admit to, and I could filter it or find another metaphor for it - but it doesn't feel right to me.\" The man who inspired Truth Serum is a \"very spiritual, very special guy,\" the singer says. \"After he heard Habits, he sent me one very long, very self-destructive poem. He said everything I was saying, but from his end. Since then I haven't spoken to him.\" Despite her no-nonsense approach, Tove balances melodrama and melancholy with a twisted, and distinctly Scandinavian, sense of humour. An earlier, self-released single,  , parodies the preposterous promises musicians make in love songs.  \"Chop off my hands, chop off my feet,\" she sings, \"I'd do it for you. Ain't love sweet?\" At one point, she even threatens to set herself on fire. Not, one hopes, a lyric based on experience. \"No!\" she laughs. \"I have never set myself on fire... But I did once set another girl's hair on fire accidentally. \"We had an argument in a bar and she was walking away. I took out my lighter and kind of waved it in her direction, like \" \", and it accidentally caught in her hair.  \"There were fumes coming out, so I ran after her and patted her on the back to put it out, but she thought I was trying to hit her. It was really awkward.\" She might sound like a handful, but in person Tove Lo is likeable and slightly shy - fiddling with her hair and book-ending answers with a soft giggle. Born Ebba Tove Elsa Nilsson, she grew up in a \"pretty posh family\" in the Stockholm suburb of Djursholm.  Her life-long nickname \"Lo\" is Swedish for Lynx - a tufty species of wildcat she \"fell in love with\" while visiting an animal park. \"Three years old, I was standing with my face pressed against the glass,\" she recalls. \"I didn't want to leave. So my parents started calling me Tove Lo and it stuck.\" Home life was comfortable. \"We had a nice house,\" she says. \"We lived by the water and I was a pretty normal kid until my teenage years, then I dyed my hair pink and spiralled out of control.\" The reason for her rebellion was one Kurt Cobain. \"I fell in love with the Kurt and Courtney story, even though I was only 12,\" she says. \" I had all the posters on my bedroom wall - the   where he has loads of eyeliner. I was fascinated by grunge and it started there.  \"Growing up so safe, I think I was looking for something else.\" Although she's switched allegiance from grunge to pop, her use of dynamics (quiet verses, thunderous choruses) is still indebted to the Nirvana template. \"I'm a lot more inspired by that stuff than I think,\" she says. \"I like the music to be more direct - that's part of my way of writing without realising it.\" No wonder, then, that the Truth Serum EP - which contains more hooks than a coat rack - has made people sit up and listen. But the singer insists she never intended to become famous. \"If I wanted that, then I would have gone on Idol (Sweden's Pop Idol) - and I got the offer so many times,\" she says.  \"There's easy ways to get famous today if you want to. I had lots of meetings in the States, and they were saying, 'an artist is a business, we're going to turn you into an Empire!'  \"They would ask questions like, 'what would you wear to the red carpet?' and I would go 'I don't give a crap about the red carpet! Who cares?'\" Tove looks up to Beyonce - \"she never makes a mistake, she's not flawed vocally, physically\" - but sees her own career taking a different path. \"I'm a bit more rough around the edges. I couldn't release a fragrance - I don't even wear perfume - but obviously I'd like to have her audience!\" That day could come soon: Several magazines have anointed her a \"pop star in waiting\", and the singer is hard at work on her debut album.  \"I feel I have the songs,\" she says. \"That's what I love doing, so it doesn't scare me.  \"But I want the album to have the kind of storyline that Truth Serum has - so it feels connected, not a bunch of songs put together. It all depends how long that takes me.\" If that album makes her a star, and if she's very, very lucky, British DJs will finally learn how to say her name.  For the record, it's pronounced \" \" but Tove doesn't mind if people approach it phonetically. \"It's a Scandinavian name, so no-one's ever going to say it right in English,\" she laughs. \"And also,  sounds a bit like 'to the loo' which is not so good. So Tove Lo is alright.\" ",

        "article": "Welsh director Gareth Evans reveals why he chose to make a follow-up to The Raid, the low-budget martial arts thriller that became an international hit in 2011. Indonesian film The Raid cost around $1 million (\u00a3596,000) to make but made 15 times that sum at the worldwide box office in 2011. Described by some film critics as \"the best action film of all time\", its visceral martial arts scenes and large body count made it a cult classic with fans. Now The Raid 2 arrives in UK cinemas, four months on from its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Its maker is 34-year-old Gareth Evans, originally from Hirwaun in south Wales, who now lives in Indonesia.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Gareth Evans talks to BBC Wales Today about his career and films According to Evans, the first film's plot was \"pretty simple, because we had no budget. A policeman, Rama, has to fight his way to the top of a gang-controlled building without dying himself.\" In contrast, The Raid 2 \"has far more of a story [that] expands the criminal world of the first film\". \"If the audience are willing to follow us into it,\" Evans continues, \"it will have a very different feel to the first one.\" The Raid became the most successful Indonesian film release of all time, prompting international interest in Pencak Silat, the local martial art it featured, and making a star of Iko Uwais, the stuntman-actor who plays Rama.  Evans and Uwais had worked together before on Merentau, a cult martial arts hit in Indonesia. The international reaction to The Raid, though, took both by surprise. \"I never expected it,\" admits Evans. \"And at first it felt like there was a certain amount of novelty publicity around it. A Welshman has made this Indonesian martial arts movie, there's a thing! \"What it has done is given both myself and Iko a certain amount of career security. I certainly had offers to make other films after it came out, but nothing compared to the prospect of making the sequel. I was passionately committed to it.\" Now signed to the prestigious William Morris talent agency in the US, Evans is also serving as a producer on a Hollywood remake of The Raid. The film will be made by The Expendables 3 director Patrick Hughes, with   suggesting Australian actor Chris Hemsworth or his brother Liam will take the lead role. \"I know that it's inevitable that a great foreign language movie will be made and Hollywood will want to remake it,\" sighs Evans. \"Just like The Ring or Let the Right One In, fans will look at it and say 'why on earth is it getting remade? The only thing that's any different is there are no subtitles.' \"But the way I see it is that some kid who listens to Justin Bieber will probably go and see the Hollywood version of The Raid, and then he might discover the foreign originals that I've made. \"Once he's seen these films, I doubt he'll like Justin Bieber any more. In that way, I'll have done some good in the world.\" The Raid 2 picks up a couple of hours from where the first film ended, with Rama - having just disposed of hundreds of criminals - being asked to go undercover in prison. Those who loved the first story for its non-stop martial arts sequences may be disappointed that the new film, at two-and-a-half hours and with five times the budget, has more dialogue and conversation pieces in the criminal underworld where it is set. \"I don't think I've made a big, bloated film with the budget I've had,\" Evans counters. \"In fact, every penny is on screen again. \"I hope fans will like it because this is the film I originally wrote, when I wanted to make the first Raid, but we simply didn't have the money. \"I was a frustrated director, simply desperate to make a film, and so I rewrote it to be set around one building, which was considerably cheaper than multiple locations. \"This still has all the blood and guts of the first; I think there might be more actually. I hope it's still a visceral spectacle. \"The Raid 2 is very violent. I appreciate some people won't like that, but you have to remember we are following a film tradition of Indonesian martial arts films. I want to have made something edgy.\" Uwais and Evans are now local heroes in Indonesia, where they are credited for bringing back a martial art movie tradition that, according to the director, \"died off in the 1970s\". Despite this, the Welshman reveals his next two directing jobs will be in the UK and the US.  \"Everything is working really, really well for me right now,\" he says. \"Just being able to make a film is a dream come true.\" Raid fans need not fret, though. Evans is open that the series was designed as a trilogy and has pledged will return to direct the final instalment.  \"I've already planned it out - it's definitely going to happen,\" he insists. \"There's going to be no rest for the characters at the end of this film.\" ",

Judah's twin sculptures have been installed in the nave of St Paul's Cathedral in London and were created to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of World War One. But in an attempt to bring the memorials up to date, Judah has stuck war ravaged townscapes, reminiscent of scenes from Syria and Afghanistan, on the 20-ft-tall (6m) cruciforms. And those in charge of the cathedral have been thrilled with the end result. The Reverend Canon Mark Oakley said the sculptures \"provoke us into interrogating the present world and the landscapes we casually view on the news every day.\" BBC News was given a tour of the artist's studio and a sneak preview of the structures, before they are officially unveiled on Palm Sunday, 13 April.

David Sillito looks back at the life of Sue Townsend Sue Townsend failed her 11 plus, left school at 15 and wrote in secret, but she went on to become one of the UK's best-selling and beloved authors.  Susan Lillian Townsend was born in Leicester in 1946, the city where she set her most famous work, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4. The story of the pimply, pretentious teenager who painted his room black and obsessed about a girl called Pandora sold two million copies when it was released at the end of 1982.  Adored by fellow teenagers and adults alike, the book was followed by The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole in 1984 - making Townsend the best-selling novelist of the 1980s.  Townsend said she grew up \"comic-poor - what the Americans now call trailer-trash\", as the eldest of three daughters.  But there were always books in their home and, after discovering children's classics, she was soon reading one a day. \"I do think that books, good books, free you,\" she told writer Alan Clark, a friend and former creative writing student who interviewed her for Mediterranean Life magazine.  \"They make you feel a citizen of the world and things like class, sex and age don't matter. They're the greatest leveller.\" After leaving school, she worked as a petrol pump attendant, shop assistant and factory hand, before training as a community worker. She married at 18 but hid her writing from her first husband, inside sofa cushions and under the stairs. He left her and she was soon juggling three jobs, writing at night while her three children were asleep.  \"I became an insomniac, really, hardly slept at all, didn't even try to,\" she told The Guardian  .  \"And it's carried on. I hate to say I only need as much sleep as Mrs Thatcher, but I can cope really well on five hours.\" It was not until she confessed all to her partner Colin Broadway - who she later married and had another child with - that she was encouraged to join a local writers' group at the Phoenix Theatre in Leicester, winning an award for her first play.  The Adrian Mole series first started life as a play on BBC Radio 4 - first broadcast with the title The Diary of Nigel Mole, Aged 13 1/4.   A publisher heard it and offered her a contract to turn it into a book. A name change and another seven instalments followed along with TV and theatre adaptations.  Townsend often said she identified with Adrian but she was amazed by the book's success, both in the UK and abroad.  \"Now I realise that Adrian is simply a type of person who exists everywhere, regardless of nationality,\" she told Clark.  \"Shy, thoughtful, oversensitive, repressed. In a hut in the Gambia at this moment, there's an Adrian Mole getting on people's tits.\" She never allowed any of the books to carry an illustration of Mole though, as she wanted people to be able to visualise the character for themselves. Townsend had a heart attack when she was just 40 and was registered blind in 2001, after a 15-year battle with diabetes. She would lie on a sofa, dictating her final books to her writer son Sean, who - in 2009, donated one of his kidneys to his mother.  \"It makes me sound like Barbara Cartland. But I'm never as well groomed as she was,\"   in March 2012. During a BBC interview later that month, at the new Mansfield Library where she was speaking to a visually-impaired reading group, Townsend said of losing her sight: \"You can't underestimate what a devastating blow it is.\" She added: \"People would say, 'You're so good about it.' But inside... to me not being able to read, I still haven't come to terms with it yet.\" She also had neuropathic arthropathy - Charcot's joint -  which weakened the bones in her legs and feet and meant she had to use a wheelchair.  Before she lost her sight completely, Townsend would carry a large magnifying glass, which Stephen Mangan - who played Adrian in the BBC adaptation of The Cappuccino Years - remembers being trained on him.  \"When I auditioned to play Adrian, I remember she told me that he couldn't be too good looking,\" he said.  \"She pulled out a magnifying glass, came up right to my face - because her sight was just in the last stages of going, scanned me all over and said that I was indeed 'not good-looking enough to play the part'.  \"She was very funny, there was a lot of laughter whenever you met Sue,\" added Mangan.   Media requires JavaScript to play. Adrian Mole author Sue Townsend reveals she still has not come to terms with losing her eyesight through diabetes. The Cappuccino Years was a satire on New Labour, with Pandora now an MP and Adrian a chef in London.  Townsend was a passionate socialist and politics also influenced Adrian Mole's teenage years, under Thatcher's government. The eighth Mole instalment, Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years, was published in 2009.  However, Townsend suffered a stroke over Christmas 2012 and, at the Oxford Literary Festival a few months later, revealed she had to push back the release date of the ninth book as a result.  \"It was on the way until the stroke interrupted me,\" she said.  Her other best-selling novels include The Queen and I - about the Royal Family being forced to move to a council estate after a revolution - and 2012's The Woman Who Went to Bed for a Year, about a middle aged mum who refuses to get up from bed.  \"Oh I'd love to [do that],\" Townsend told The Big Issue. \"A month would be great. Just getting up now and again, you know, to take showers and stuff. I wouldn't get bored, I'd listen to the radio.\" Townsend also published a more serious novel, Ghost Children, about the life-long effects of having an abortion, based on her own experiences - and often talked about writing \"a masterpiece\".  \"I wanted to be Dostoevsky but my way of coping with the world has always been humour,\" she told Clark.  \"In the playground I always made people laugh, I used to charge them three pence for an impression of a teacher. It kept me in toffees.\" Writers and comedians including JK Rowling, David Walliams, Matt Lucas and Caitlin Moran were all quick to pay tribute to that humour on Twitter.  Having left school at 15, Townsend was awarded an honorary Masters of Arts from Leicester University and, in 2008, was made a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the university. She was also an Honorary Doctor of Letters at Loughborough University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. \"I hate it when people call me a 'national treasure',\"   in 2010, while promoting The Prostrate Years.  \"It takes away your bite and makes you feel like a harmless old golden Labrador.\" In 2009, Townsend was given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester.  She was surrounded by her family when she died at her home in the city on 10 April, following a short illness. ",
