They are given guidance as to what they should do for disabled supporters and how many spaces they should provide but this isn't being followed.\n     \"The problem is that the clubs aren't being made to follow it, and neither the FA nor the Premier League has any rules telling them what the minimum standard should be. As a result, the experience of a disabled fan varies greatly from ground to ground.\n     \"Football showed in the wake of Hillsborough and the move to all-seater stadiums that it is capable of drastic action.  However, until clubs are forced to follow these guidelines, wide-scale change in this case appears unlikely.\"\n     Penning said a complete overhaul of grounds was required, \"starting at the very top\".\n     He added: \"The situation is currently woefully inadequate and it is not only wheelchair access that falls short, but access for people with all kinds of impairments.\"\n     Guidelines on how football clubs in the UK should cater for disabled spectators have been in place since 2004. \n     The \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     sets out minimum standards that all new grounds have to meet in the provision, location, and quality of facilities for disabled fans. The number of wheelchair spaces a stadium should provide is based on its capacity. \n     Since the implementation of the Equality Act in 2010, and legislation dating back to 1995, it has been illegal for service providers, including football clubs, to treat disabled people less favourably than other customers.\n     Clubs can be ordered to make reasonable adjustments, which can include providing induction loops for those with hearing impairments, audio-description facilities for those with sight impairments and free tickets for carers who accompany disabled fans at games.\n     The Premier League insist they are following the existing regulations, and said: \"The Accessible Stadia Guide sets out agreed standards to be achieved when new grounds are designed or existing grounds rebuilt, however all clubs use those standards to assess existing provisions and guide them on how to make improvements.\n     \"Particular attention is given to achieving stadium management solutions that make the best of the constraints and opportunities inherent in each stadium. This includes working with the fans to arrive at solutions that work for them, and providing special training for stewards and staff to ensure that appropriate assistance is given.\" \n     Joyce Cook, chair of \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     formerly known as the National Association of Disabled Supporters, added: \"The experience of disabled football fans varies across the country. That's not acceptable and it's time all football clubs took their legal obligations seriously.\"\n ",

The claims are understood to have been made between 2005 and 2009.  MP for Wellingborough   he had \"done nothing wrong\", adding that it was \"not unusual for MPs to have their expenses challenged\".  A spokeswoman for the commissioner declined to comment further.  The system for investigating alleged abuses of MPs' expenses was reformed in 2009, after a string of scandals, but cases involving claims made before 2010 still invoke the previous investigatory system.   This means that the independent commissioner investigates the allegations before submitting a report to the standards committee.  The committee, which comprises 10 MPs and three members of the public, then has the final say on whether to accept the commissioner's conclusions.  ",

David Cameron described Offa's Dyke as the line between life and death Prime Minister David Cameron said Wales was witnessing a \"national scandal\" as Offa's Dyke \"has become the line between life and death\".  Addressing the Welsh Conservative conference in Llangollen, Mr Cameron said the healthcare workforce were being \"woefully let down by Labour\".  He criticised Welsh Labour on education and the NHS, saying patients were waiting too long for heart scans.  He said Welsh Labour was guilty of \"appalling, inexcusable complacency\". \"One in seven people in Wales is on an NHS waiting list,\" he said. \"A cancer drugs fund is in England - but not here. After this utter shambles Labour should never dare call themselves the party of the NHS again\u201d \"I tell you - when Offa's Dyke becomes the line between life and death, we are witnessing a national scandal.\" He said families had seen loved ones waiting too long for treatment - and they were \"sometimes dying\". \"After this utter shambles Labour should never dare call themselves the party of the NHS again,\" he said. \"Welsh Conservatives are arguing heart and soul that it doesn't have to be this way... with real courage and reform, things can be different.\" Mr Cameron insisted the Tories were arguing for more funding, more transparency, more power to doctors and nurses.  It comes on the day a key report said NHS funding cuts may be behind longer waiting times but Wales was not lagging behind the rest of the UK. He also talked about education, saying it was a \"competitive world, it's not softer subjects and 'experimental' teaching these children need\". \"It's proper spelling in English, basic arithmetic in maths, the best of our history, proper respected exams,\" he said. \"It's not more of this failed, left-wing, ideological clap-trap we need... it's more rigour, more standards, more choice, more hope.\" Mr Cameron said his party was ambitious for Wales and insisted the Conservatives' long-term economic plan was working.  He said Wales was now the \"UK capital for jobs growth\". He also said the Conservatives had agreed to the largest investment in Welsh railways since the Victorian era, including electrifying the mainlines to Cardiff and Swansea. During his speech Mr Cameron said he believed in devolving income tax. He has already offered such powers subject to a referendum.  He told delegates he would like to see the Welsh government being more responsible for raising the money it spent.  Earlier, UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt launched his strongest attack on the NHS in Wales claiming it is \"sleepwalking to a Mid Staffs tragedy\". Mr Hunt criticised Wales' record on waiting times and ambulance targets. He admitted things can go wrong. \"In a system as big and complex as the NHS things do go wrong,\" he told the conference. \"But if you ignore the evidence when individual problems pile up, if you stick your head in the sand and pretend all will be fine... well, that's exactly what happened at Mid Staffs under the last Labour government in England. \"And that is what the Labour government in Cardiff is risking right now in Wales. \"They are sleepwalking into a Welsh Mid Staffs tragedy and unless we shout loud enough - alongside brave campaigners like Ann Clwyd, Gareth Williams and others who tragically lost loved ones in Welsh hospitals - these appalling lapses in care will repeat themselves time after time.\" It is not the first time Mr Hunt has criticised the NHS in Wales. In February, he claimed patients were suffering because Labour Welsh ministers were not investigating high death rates in hospitals. Mr Hunt called it a \"tragedy\" that the Welsh NHS was not adopting reforms introduced in England since the Stafford Hospital scandal. Since he made the statement a new version of Welsh hospital death rates has been published, which takes into account differences between Wales and England. Figures from six hospitals with above-average death rates are being reviewed by an independent expert, to establish whether they need further investigation. Later, Welsh Conservative Shadow Minister for Health Darren Millar encouraged a standing ovation for a mention of Labour Cynon Valley MP Ann Clwyd. Ms Clwyd has been a  ",

The Conservative peer, whose wife was paralysed by an IRA bomb, had suggested dissident republicans would shoot him for attending a Royal banquet.  His remarks were criticised as \"highly dangerous\" by Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers.  Lord Tebbit said he now regretted the trouble his comments had caused. When asked if he would withdraw his remarks, Lord Tebbit said: \"I don't think I would advise anyone or entreaty anybody to shoot Mr McGuinness - I would welcome it if he was brought to trial, of course.\"  Mr McGuinness has previously received death threats from dissident republican paramilitaries over Sinn F\u00e9in's support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He had described Lord Tebbit's initial comments as \"absolutely dismaying\". Lord Tebbit said the criticism of his remarks by Mr McGuinness were \"a bit rich\".  \"When he has owned up to the crimes that were plotted and carried out by the IRA when he was a leader and could have said 'no we must not do that', when he has pleaded for forgiveness and expressed his repentance, then of course I would be very pleased to meet him and talk about those things,\" he said.  Lord Tebbit said his wife Margaret had not been in good health since she was injured in the 1984 bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Conservative Party's conference.  \"She is in a great deal of pain, she is extremely limited in what she can do and she is entirely dependent on people to look after her,\" he said.  \"We are not able to go on a holiday or anything of that kind, and she can scarcely go to visit anyone because there are very few places that are adequately equipped for her to be looked after.  \"She lives a very restricted life - she is in prison.\" ",

Taking questions at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he said he had \"a deep sense of gratitude to Israel for what they did for my grandmother\".  She survived the Holocaust in Poland before emigrating to the country.  But Mr Miliband said he did not support everything the Israeli government did, criticising the growth in settlements.  Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and formally annexed the area in 1980.  Settlements built there and elsewhere in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this and continues to approve the construction of new settlement homes. Although the Labour leader is of Jewish descent, he told the BBC in 2010 that he does not believe in God. \"I have great respect for those people who do,\" he added.  He paid his respects at the memorial to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, Yad Vashem, and has held meetings with Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  ",

        "article": "UKIP MEPs are untrustworthy and do not stand up for the UK in Europe, David Cameron has said. The PM took direct aim at the party aiming to overtake the Tories in May's Euro elections, saying they seldom \"bothered to vote\" in Brussels. He was speaking at the launch of the Conservative European and English local election campaign. UKIP accused him of \"unfairly insulting millions of voters\", many of whom \"normally back his own party\".  Mr Cameron is seeking to shift the focus from ex-culture secretary Maria Miller's expenses to the EU-wide polls, which are scheduled for 22 May in the UK. In a speech at Manchester airport, he categorised his rivals in \"two extremist camps\", with one professing love for the EU, and the other hate.  Both camps were neglecting the UK's national interest, he argued, re-iterating his pledge to reform the UK's relationship with the EU and hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives win a majority at the 2015 general election.  \"If you want real change in Europe that works for you, for your family, for your business, then the Conservative Party is the only party which can deliver for you,\" Mr Cameron said.   He directed specific criticism at Labour, who he accused of having signed off \"power to Brussels, summit after summit\", and the Lib Dems, who he said were \"absolutely devoted to their dream of ever closer union\".  But his strongest broadside was reserved for UKIP, which campaigns for the UK to leave the EU - and which Mr Cameron has tended to avoid attacking at length in previous campaign speeches.  It's been a difficult week for David Cameron, with Maria Miller resigning because of a row over her expenses. Today's speech was about giving a rallying call six weeks before the European elections. After the Budget the Conservatives seemed to be riding high but the situation surrounding Mrs Miller changed that. We've had head-to-head TV debates between  Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg. Did Mr Cameron make a mistake by not taking part, having seen Mr Farage pick up points in the polls? Today Mr Cameron branded those who say we should leave the EU immediately and those who say the EU should remain unchanged as extremists. May's election will be an interesting indicator as to whether voters are more convinced by Mr Cameron's position or those he dismisses. \"When it comes to standing up for Britain in Europe, is there anyone you would trust less than a group of UKIP MEPs?\" he asked.    \"They talk the talk in Britain, but as soon as they're on that plane to Brussels they change completely. When they do actually bother to vote, they don't stand up for Britain. Indeed their own leader has said they cannot change a thing in Brussels. \"In contrast, we are the only party with a clear plan. Renegotiate. Get the best deal for Britain. Then put the decision to the British people.\"  Responding to the comments, UKIP's director of communications Patrick O'Flynn said: \"By branding anyone who wants to get Britain out of the EU an extremist, David Cameron is not only unfairly insulting millions of UKIP voters but also doing the same to more than half of those who normally back his own party.  \"Anyone who thinks Britain would be better off coming out of the EU and thereby restoring the ability to control its own borders now knows what to do on May 22nd: vote UKIP and cause a political earthquake.  \"Wanting your own country to be self-governing once again is not an extreme position but just plain common sense.\" The clashes come in the wake of a protracted row over Mrs Miller's position.  She resigned as culture secretary after admitting that she had wrongly claimed \u00a35,800 for mortgage interest and apologising for the way she handled an inquiry into her expenses.  The PM had repeatedly defended her. Earlier,   that Chancellor George Osborne led a \"revolt to force Miller out\", but Downing Street sources said this was \"rubbish\".  Mr Cameron said he was \"very sorry\" to accept her resignation on Wednesday morning, telling her she should be \"extremely proud\" of her work in government.  Mrs Miller has been replaced by the Conservative MP for Bromsgrove Sajid Javid, an ally of the chancellor who was promoted from his previous job as Financial Secretary to the Treasury.  The Times said his elevation had been \"taken as evidence of a further strengthening of Mr Osborne's grip on government\" - and that Mr Osborne and Tory election chief Lynton Crosby had warned about the damage being done to the party's electoral prospects by the row.  On Wednesday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage visited Mrs Miller's Basingstoke constituency, arguing that the row \"reflected very badly on David Cameron\". \"He has completely misjudged the public mood on this,\" Mr Farage said.  Labour leader Ed Miliband also accused Mr Cameron of a \"terrible error of judgement\" in failing to sack her sooner. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Michael Fabricant has also been sacked, from his post as the party's vice-chairman, partly for tweeting that it was \"about time\" Mrs Miller resigned. The active user of the social media site said he had been asked to resign and refused, so was sacked \"over HS2 and my views on a recent cabinet minister\".   ",

        "article": "Scotch whisky exports stagnated last year, as sales were hit by slowing demand in China and other emerging markets. Figures from the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) showed overseas sales remained flat at \u00a34.3bn by value. In volume terms, exports increased by 2.5% to the equivalent of 1.23 billion bottles.  Scotch whisky performed strongly in the US, Mexico and India but direct exports to China fell by nearly 30% to \u00a351m.  Sales to Taiwan, South Korea and Japan also fell in value, by between 13% and 15%.  We've heard from individual distillers that the fall-off in the Chinese market has a lot to do with official government disapproval of conspicuous consumption, and a crackdown on the culture of business gifts, as they easily cross the line into corruption. It's a challenge that has hit the premium and luxury goods market in quite a big way.  The best performers included the US, which saw exports of Scotch grow 8% on 2012 to a record \u00a3819m.  The US was by far the largest market for whisky by value.  France remained the largest volume market for Scotch.  SWA said sales there rose by 16% as the market recovered following a tax hike on spirits at the start of 2012. India,  which is now Scotch whisky's fourth biggest market by volume, saw the value of whisky sales climb by 12% to \u00a369m.  SWA said it hoped EU-India Free Trade Agreement negotiations would restart following this year's Indian elections, leading to a reduction of the current 150% import tariff. Exports to Brazil and Mexico grew by about 20% - to \u00a399m in Brazil and \u00a3110m in Mexico. A career in the British diplomatic service means David Frost is schooled in the art of choosing his words carefully. The Scotch Whisky Association's chief executive has concerns about independence but he is careful not to overstate them, insisting the vote is a \"decision for the people of Scotland,\" not for its companies. Nonetheless, Mr Frost is seeking \"reassurances\" about the \"risks\" of a 'yes' vote. In the SWA's sunny boardroom in Edinburgh he told me he was concerned that the Scottish government's white paper on independence \"talks of a network of 70 to 90 overseas embassies,\" compared to \"getting on for 200 posts\" in the existing UK diplomatic service. According to the SWA, Scotch whisky represents about 85% of Scottish food and drink exports and about one quarter of the British total, with the industry's exports worth \u00a3135 a second to the UK balance of trade. \"It is important that an independent Scotland gives the same kind of support to the industry and finds ways of doing it that are comparable to what we have now,\" said Mr Frost. \"We're confident this industry is going to succeed whatever the situation after the 18th of September. So we are concerned about the conditions in which we would be operating. We see some risks. We want reassurances. But are we going  to be successful? Yes, you bet.\" In January, spirits producer Diageo reported slowing sales in China and other emerging markets. The company said new rules over gift-giving and spending by Chinese officials dented sales in the country by 66%.  SWA chief executive David Frost said: \"Scotch whisky exports remain strong and the industry's impressive performance makes a major contribution to the UK's trade performance.  \"The unprecedented investment programmes in Scotch whisky by producers show that in the long term they are confident that demand will continue to grow.   \"However, in the short run, there are some economic headwinds. Formal and informal barriers to trade remain.\"  He added: \"We should remember that the industry's success does not come automatically but is based on hard work, investment and careful stewardship.\"  Mr Frost also made a plea for strong government backing for the industry. He said: \"As a former ambassador, I know that the industry also depends on strong political support from government, for example to influence European Union negotiations on our behalf or to press other countries to allow better access to their markets.  \"Both the UK and Scottish governments have played an important role in this so far.\"  He added: \"Whatever the outcome of the Scottish referendum, as an industry exporting to around 200 markets we will continue to need the backing of an effective diplomatic network with the necessary global reach, commercial expertise, and capacity to influence.\"     Overall, Scotch whisky accounts for about 85% of Scottish food and drink exports and nearly a quarter of the British total.

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. George Osborne: \"If you are hiding your money offshore, we are coming to get you\" People who hide their money overseas to avoid paying tax face bigger fines and could be jailed more easily under government plans to fight tax evasion. To prosecute at present, tax officials must prove a person holding income offshore has intended to evade tax. But under a new criminal standard officials would only have to show money was taxable and undeclared. Chancellor George Osborne said the changes would mean there was \"no safe haven\" for those evading tax. But Labour said the government was \"failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion\". A consultation will be held to let the public have their say on the plans.  In recent months, the UK has joined other G20 countries in focusing on moves to share information about tax evasion. Now, Mr Osborne says the government will consult on a new criminal standard, harsher fines and increased jail sentences.   At present, offshore tax evaders can be fined twice the amount they owe, and can face criminal prosecution and a possible prison sentence. The government will look at options to increase these penalties, as well as the possibility of financial rewards for whistleblowers who \"help uncover\" untaxed offshore assets. Mr Osborne, who is in Washington DC for the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, said: \"A very important part of our economic plan is that everyone makes a fair contribution.  \"We've already done a lot to crack down on those who don't pay their taxes, now we're introducing a new criminal offence for people who hide their money offshore. \"And the message is very simple - if you're hiding your money offshore, we are coming to get you and the criminal law is going to come and find you.\"  Media requires JavaScript to play. Joe Lynam reports: ''The government wants to tilt the law in favour of the taxman and against secretive millionaires'' Bill Dodwell, head of tax at Deloitte, told the   newspaper the plans were \"horrifying\". \"People should not be put in prison unless you can prove intent,\" he said. \"I'm shocked to find that an offence which could lead to a prison sentence could be decided on a strict-liability basis. \"If this change applies to all evasion cases I think that's unacceptable.\" Ray McCann, tax partner at the law firm Pinsent Masons, said: \"I think what we'd probably be seeing here would be a sort of lower level criminal offence, largely intended to give further encouragement to those who have been evading tax to come forward. \"I would be surprised if we see an increased number of people ending up in the dock and very surprised if any of them were being sent to prison as a result.\" Bob Rothenberg, senior partner at Blick Rothenberg chartered accountants, said he believed the government wanted to frighten people people into owning up, rather than prosecute them. At a time when families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and the deficit is still high, this simply isn't good enough\u201d \"That certainly has been the objective that they've followed up to now, with their various... so-called amnesties,\" he said. \"And I think that they are thinking that they may get a greater number of people coming forward if the threat of criminal prosecution is there.\" Mr McCann added: \"The over-arching difficulty that the Revenue have got is that for about 100 years in this country, we've operated a sort of prodigal son policy. \"So if someone who has got hidden assets decides to come clean and march into the local tax office, put their hands up and confess all, then the public policy put forward by the government in this country was not to prosecute them. \"And that policy is still in place.\" Mr Osborne predicted a tax deal struck between the British and Swiss governments in 2011 would recover about \u00a33bn in previously unpaid taxes in 2013. Figures showed about \u00a3800m was collected last year. Shadow exchequer secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"For all the tough talk, this government is failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion.  \"The amount of uncollected tax rose last year and the chancellor's Swiss tax deal has raised less than a quarter of the revenues promised.  \"At a time when families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and the deficit is still high, this simply isn't good enough.\" BBC business reporter Michelle Fleury said finance leaders from the world's 20 leading economies had been ramping up their fight against tax evasion.  Prime Minister David Cameron made tax a key issue during Britain's presidency of the G8 last year. More than \u00a31.5bn has been recovered from offshore tax evaders over the past two years, according to HM Revenue & Customs. ",

        "article": "Philip Atkins and Roger Lawrence are lifelong friends.  They first met as schoolboys at Denstone College in north Staffordshire, more years ago than either of them care to recall, and their very different career paths have eventually led them in remarkably similar directions. They both now lead large local authorities which find themselves the closest of collaborators on the most ambitious of projects -  Close to the border between our biggest shire county and one of our big city authorities is the Midlands' most ambitious economic regeneration venture. The i54 site extends over 226 acres. It's where cutting-edge manufacturers, including Moog and Jaguar Land Rover, are creating over 2,000 jobs - JLR alone is spending \u00a3500m on its giant engine factory there. At the heart of the initiative is a partnership between three local authorities: South Staffordshire is the district authority responsible not only for the planning of the site but also for the local business rates which will go into the i54 mix.  But ours is the story of the two councils who are co-funding the site in general, and in particular, the construction of a new junction 2 on the M54 motorway, due to open at the end of this year at a cost of \u00a338m.    Partners though councillors Atkins and Lawrence may be, they are also political polar opposites. As Staffordshire's Conservative leader, Mr Atkins has responded to year-after-year of budgetary austerity by embracing the process of merging and sharing services.  He says local government has a way to go yet in terms of working smarter and forging new partnerships like the ones he is working on with the police and healthcare agencies.  His is an upper-tier council which is responsible for strategic services like education, refuse disposal and highways. The authority is maintaining a freeze on council tax. Labour-controlled Wolverhampton, by contrast, is increasing its council tax by just under the 2% that would otherwise have triggered a referendum. It is one of the councils parodied by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles as \"democracy dodgers\".  Leader Roger Lawrence points out that his authority faces a vastly heavier burden supporting concentrations of the weakest and poorest in the community than more affluent areas like Staffordshire; and that they also have proportionately less revenue-raising potential.  He was recently forced to announce 2,000 council jobs losses as part of \u00a3123m savings over five years. No wonder the two councils display such contrasting philosophies. Mr Atkins sees the evolution of local government as a continuing process, Mr Lawrence makes clear that in an ideal world [which for him includes a Labour government] he would hope to reverse at least some of the austerity measures he himself has introduced. Local library opening hours have been reduced to 24 a week but it would obviously be a relatively straightforward matter to restore full-time opening when and if the council's budgets allow.  I was delighted when councillors Atkins and Lawrence accepted my invitation to meet me at i54 to air their differences and consider the way forward.  What followed was a stimulating and thought-provoking conversation which you will be able to see for yourself. It will be one of our main talking points in this weekend's Sunday Politics Midlands. The council leaders were brave enough to join me. I hope you will be too. ",

        "article": "Politicians are often described, somewhat optimistically, as popular figures in Parliament, but in the case of Nigel Evans it is true. There was profound shock on all sides when the allegations of sexual offences against the then deputy Speaker first surfaced - and no shortage of MPs and peers willing to speak up for him. \"Nigel Evans is a hugely popular figure, a very gregarious figure,\" said Cardiff North MP Jonathan Evans, at the time. \"He is friends, really, with everybody. Very unusually in politics, he is warmly regarded by all parties.\" Among those offering character references, which were read out in court during his trial, were Labour MP Glenda Jackson, who described him as \"courteous, humorous and respectful of opinions\" and a \"hard-working backbencher\".  Labour's Ann Clwyd described him as \"naturally sociable\" and \"invaluable\" when dealing with foreign politicians as part of their roles on various committees.  Conservative MP Eleanor Laing, who won the election to replace him as deputy Speaker, said he was a \"well-respected, popular member of the House\", who was \"kind and thoughtful\" and \"known to be a gentle person\". Former MP Ann Widdecombe described him as a \"truthful, considerate and kind individual,\" adding that \"such qualities at Westminster are not universal\". There were similarly fulsome tributes from colleagues on Twitter when news of his acquittal broke. \"So pleased for my friend Nigel Evans today. A good man. Horrid experience to go through,\"   Pembrokeshire. \"Nigel Evans was an excellent Deputy Speaker and a lovely man. So pleased  he has been found not guilty,\"  . Mr Evans, 55, who resigned the Conservative whip and sat as an independent MP in the run-up to his trial, had earned his position in public life the hard way. The son of a Swansea newsagent, he liked to say it was \"God's little joke\" that he had been born a Conservative in south Wales, a Labour heartland. After joining the party at the age of 17, he got himself elected as a county councillor in his 20s and, by his early 30s had made two attempts to get into Parliament for Welsh seats. He finally achieved his ambition in 1992, in the Lancashire seat of Ribble Valley, after losing out to the Liberal Democrats at a by-election in the seat a year earlier.  He kept his links with Swansea, thanks to the family business, founded by his father. John Major appointed him the Conservative spokesman for Wales after the party's 1997 election defeat and, in 2001, he was made shadow Wales secretary by Iain Duncan Smith. He resigned from the post in 2003 when Michael Howard took up the leadership and decided not to include a Welsh affairs spokesman in his top team - a move criticised by Evans. At the time he said he had been offered the chance to carry on as Welsh affairs spokesman outside the cabinet, but had decided to return to the back benches instead. At the 2010 general election he retained his seat with a majority of more than 14,700 over his second-placed Labour rival. He abandoned any frontbench ambitions and decided instead to seek the non-partisan role of deputy Speaker, one of the most coveted in the Commons.  He was elected to serve as one of John Bercow's three deputies, who take it in turns to stand in for the Speaker, keeping MPs in order and selecting who gets to to speak in debates. It was the first time those roles had been chosen by a ballot of MPs and Mr Evans won more votes than the other two contenders. Mr Bercow described him as someone with a sense of humour, who knew the parliamentary rules and was \"quick on his feet\". He won further admiration from colleagues when, a few months after his election, he announced he was gay, saying he was tired of \"living a lie\". Launching a parliamentary group to help MPs be open about their sexuality, Mr Evans said he had been threatened with exposure by a former MP before deciding to come out as gay. \"With my background in south Wales, it was hard enough being a Tory, let alone being gay,\" he told the Mail on Sunday.  \"It wasn't so much 'the only gay in the village' as 'the only Tory in Swansea'.\" Mr Evans went to Dynevor School and to the city's university, where he graduated in politics, and was elected to the now-defunct West Glamorgan County Council in 1985. He became deputy leader of the council's Conservative group and remained a councillor until 1991, during which time he had already fought parliamentary elections in Swansea West and Pontypridd. The esteem in which Mr Evans was held by his colleagues at Westminster was never more evident than when his boss, John Bercow, allowed him to make a personal statement to the House, when he stood down as deputy Speaker to fight the allegations. His voice cracking with emotion, he told MPs: \"This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life, alongside the loss of my mother in 2009, and the loss of my brother earlier this year. \"Winston Churchill said, 'When you are going through hell, keep going.' Sage advice.  \"And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people who mean so much to me.\" ",

        "article": "The thwack of cricket balls being hit and the sight of bowlers running in are part of an English summer. But, 100 years ago, a strike almost put an end to things. In 1907 an anonymous satirist made a joke which still resonates today. Writing in Mr Punch's Book of Sport, he (or she) stated that the \"British sphere of influence\" could be described in just three words: \"The cricket ball.\" A few years later, as the Great Powers were edging closer towards the slaughter and misery of World War One, this round, red symbol of summer - and Empire - came under threat. Angered by their low wages, the cricket ball makers of Kent went on strike in April 1914. Fears were raised that the season would be affected, even cancelled. Hand-crafted in the area for more than 150 years by that time, the balls of west Kent, home to firms such as Dukes and Alfred Reader, were seen as the best. The workers were proud. The Times, many of its readers fearful of a summer without watching the greats of the day, such as Jack Hobbs and Frank Woolley, in action, gave unusual prominence to such a small-scale dispute. \"Workers employed in the manufacture of cricket balls at Tonbridge have gone on strike to enforce their demand for an increase in wages,\" it reported. \"They want an advance of five shillings per dozen balls. The manufacturers admit that highly skilled workmen only earn 30 shillings a week, but state that retailers refuse to allow a sufficient margin to allow of the payment of a fair wage.\" In other words, cricket clubs wanted cheap balls, even if this came at the expense of a tradition. We were going nowhere, so we decided to call it a day\u201d Semi-rural Kent does not lend itself to the image of a hotbed of industrial trade unionism, but its workers were offended. Its ball manufacturers employed several hundred people at the time, many of whom complained of being treated like \"sweated labour\". \"The power of the union may be largely a thing of the past, and cricket ball manufacture, along with pretty much everything else in cricket, has now largely moved to the subcontinent\", says Matt Thacker, managing editor of   magazine.  \"But it's great to be reminded occasionally how deeply ingrained into the fabric of English life cricket was. \"It's hard to imagine these days an English season coming under threat from anything but the IPL (Indian Premier League).\" Of all sports, except perhaps baseball, cricket is the most reliant on its balls. Spin, swing, bounce - the varying state of the five-and-a-bit-ounce, stitched mass of cork and leather can massively affect the nature of play. Almost unthinkably now, Kent was the centre of an export trade, with enthusiasts in countries like Australia and India buying its wares. After a few weeks, the Amalgamated Society of Cricket Ball Makers came to an agreement with the manufacturers and the threat of an end to cricket was abated. A few months after the strike, World War One began and, within weeks, the first-class game came to a halt, but leagues, particularly in the north of England, continued and even thrived. Demand for balls continued. The cricket ball makers were not alone in being able to flex considerable muscle on a local scale. \"There were lots of small unions around at this time and they were often very effective,\" says Chris Burgess, curator of the  . \"For instance, you had the Cigarette Machine Operators' Society and the Sheffield Chauffeurs' Society. \"Cricket ball making was a skilled trade. The union would have had a big presence within the factory, looking after workers' rights and campaigning on issues like wages.\" After the 1918 Armistice, the Amalgamated Society of Cricket Ball Makers' books were found to be in a terrible state. Amid disquiet over this, a separate group, the Teston Independent Society of Cricket Ball Makers, was formed in 1919, as its title suggests, in the village of Teston, home of the Alfred Reader factory. The two unions' job got harder as the once-closed world of ball manufacture - rather like Britain's position as undoubted ruler of the Empire - came under challenge. In 1930 the ASCBM again became involved in a dispute over pay. The Australian government imposed an import tariff on cricket balls and manufacturers proposed cutting wages to cope with a loss in profits. The Australian press noted that firms in the Tonbridge area still supplied \"almost the entire Empire\". This had changed somewhat by the start of 1953, when another walkout occurred. The ball makers demanded a 9% increase in wages, but their employers would only offer 6%. The Times noted with concern in early April: \"There are only 90 craftsmen in the country and 45 have not made a ball since March 27.\" The workers soon returned. Over the years, English ball-making continued to decline, with much of the work being outsourced to lower-wage countries, such as India and Pakistan. Kent workers held another strike in 1962, calling for a sixpence-an-hour rise. After a month out, they accepted three-and-a-half pence. It was something of an industrial relations last hurrah. Only a few people are employed in ball-making in west Kent today. One of them, Matthew Waldock, says: \"I started in the 1980s and there were about 50 or 60 people working here. The Test Match balls we made were a work of art.\" Most of the work today involves selecting the English leather to be sent abroad and testing the quality of the balls when they arrive back from factories in India. In 2006, the Teston Independent Society of Cricket Ball Makers disbanded. It had just six members, making it probably the UK's smallest union. The Sheffield Shearers Society, with just nine members, folded a year later. Mr Waldock, general secretary of the Teston society at the time it was wound up, says: \"We were going nowhere, so we decided to call it a day.\" The photographs of dozens of craftsmen - in their cloth caps, shirts and collars, some perched on bicycles - defiantly on strike in 1914 show how things have changed.

Many fall by the wayside, but the Scottish National Party - which formed 80 years ago this month - is one of the exceptions. It's taken a while to get there, but, despite the party's turbulent history, it will stage a referendum on Scottish independence on 18 September, after winning two historic terms in office. The story of the SNP is one of success and failure, highs and lows, rogues and visionaries - but, most of all, it's the story of a party which started life on the fringes and became a mainstream force. The modern case for Scottish home rule goes right back to its unification with England in 1707. The view that the Scots who put their names to the Act of Union had been bribed, famously spurred Robert Burns to later write: \"We are bought and sold for English gold. Such a parcel of rogues in a nation.\" Fast forward many years and those fighting for Scottish autonomy concluded that a pro-independence, election-fighting party was the way to go. And so on Saturday 7 April 1934 at Glasgow's St Andrew's Hall, the Scottish National Party - an amalgamation of the Scottish Party and the National Party of Scotland - was formally inaugurated. But for years the SNP struggled to make an impact, partly due to the on-going debate between those who wanted to concentrate on outright independence - the fundamentalists - and those who wanted to achieve it through policies such as devolution - the gradualists. The young party's other problem was that, put simply, it just wasn't any good at fighting elections, because of its lack of funding, organisation and policies beyond independence. In its first test, the 1935 General Election, the SNP contested eight seats and won none. It was not until a decade later, at the Motherwell and Wishaw by-election, when the party finally got a break. When the contest was announced following the death of sitting Labour MP James Walker, the nationalists sent in one of their up-and-comers, Robert McIntyre. Standing largely on a platform of government failures in post-war reconstruction, the SNP took the seat with 50% of the vote, but lost it months later in the election. A lack of electoral impact forced the party to reorganise - a move which would help the SNP to an even more famous win. The 1967 Hamilton by-election should have been a breeze for Labour, but, as the party's vote collapsed, the SNP's Winnie Ewing romped home on 46%, declaring: \"Stop the world, Scotland wants to get on.\" The 1970s was the decade of boom and bust for the SNP. They failed to hang on in Hamilton, but 1970 brought the SNP its first UK election gain, in the Western Isles. That same decade also saw the beginnings of the party's \"It's Scotland's Oil\" strategy, which sought to demonstrate Scotland was seeing little direct benefit of the tax wealth brought by North Sea oil and gas. More success followed in 1973, when Margo MacDonald won the Glasgow Govan by-election and, the following year, an under-fire Tory government called an election, which it lost. The SNP gained six seats and retained the Western Isles, but lost Govan. With Labour in power as a minority government, the party had little choice but to call a second election in 1974 - but not before committing support for a Scottish Assembly. Even so, the SNP gained a further four seats, hitting its all time Westminster high of 11. The party's turn of fortunes was largely down to its visionary leader-of-the-day, Billy Wolfe. Despite the success, tensions began to develop between those in the SNP who were elected and those who were not. Then came 1979 - the year which provided two serious blows to the SNP. Margaret Thatcher's Tories swept to power, and a referendum for a devolved Scottish Assembly resulted in a \"No\" vote. To be more precise, a requirement that 40% of the total Scottish electorate had to vote \"Yes\" for the 1979 referendum to become law, was not met. With the constitutional issue off the table, the SNP came under a period of heavy fire from rivals, portrayed by Labour as the \"Tartan Tories\" and irrelevant \"Separatists\" by the Conservatives. With a post-election SNP slashed back to two MPs, the party needed a serious jump-start - but that jump-start dragged the party into a period which could have finished it off for good. The start of the 80s was a torrid time for the SNP when deep divisions gave rise to two notorious splinter groups. One was the ultra-nationalist organisation Siol Nan Gaidheal - branded \"proto fascists\" by the then SNP leader Gordon Wilson. The other was the Interim Committee for Political Discussion - more infamously known as the '79 Group, formed to sharpen the party's message and appeal to dissident Labour voters. But the party leadership was unimpressed, and when a leak of '79 Group minutes to the media raised the prospect of links with the Provisional Sinn Fein - despite claims the leaked version was inaccurate - Mr Wilson had had enough. His view that the party had to unite or die led to a ban on organised groups, but when the '79 Group refused to go quietly, several members were briefly expelled from the party. They included Scotland's future justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill, and one Alex Salmond. The 1987 election saw another bad SNP performance, emerging with only three seats. But, towards the end of the decade, were things looking up? Former Labour MP Jim Sillars, who defected to the SNP in the early 80s before becoming the architect of its independence in Europe policy, re-took Glasgow Govan for the SNP in a 1988 by-election - repeating the success of wife, Ms McDonald, more than a decade earlier. And a collapse in the Conservative vote in 1987 meant the constitutional issue was back. Now the party needed new blood at the top to take it forward into the next decade. Few people have done more to aid the success of the SNP than Alex Salmond. Despite previous form with the '79 Group, Mr Salmond had risen through the SNP ranks, becoming MP for Banff and Buchan in 1987. He did not have his work to seek on becoming leader in 1990. As well as having to deal with on-going internal issues over the party's independence policy - future minister Alex Neil had declared Scotland would be \"free by '93\" - there was an election to fight. In 1992, the SNP increased its vote, but the party was only able to retain the three seats it already had, and lost Govan. Mr Salmond moved to modernise the SNP to be more socially democratic and pro-European. For the SNP, the best it could manage in the first devolved election of 1999 was to become the main opposition to the Labour-Lib Dem coalition government. Then came Mr Salmond's surprising decision to quit as SNP leader, and as an MSP. His successor in 2000 was John Swinney, but, despite being among the party's brightest talent, the future Scottish finance secretary's four-year tenure was plagued by dissenters from within. The party dropped a seat in the 2001 UK election, and, despite a slick campaign in the 2003 Holyrood polls, the SNP once again ended up the opposition. Later that year, a little-known SNP activist called Bill Wilson challenged Mr Swinney for the leadership, accusing him of ducking responsibility for a \"plummeting\" SNP vote. Mr Swinney won a decisive victory, discarding his usual measured oratory during a hustings to declare his goal was \"to tell the Brits to get off\". If nominated I'll decline. If drafted I'll defer. And if elected I'll resign\u201d I changed my mind\u201d But he was left weakened, and, at Holyrood, SNP MSPs Bruce McFee and Adam Ingram declared they would not support Mr Swinney in a leadership ballot. Another, nationalist MSP, Campbell Martin, was flung out of the party after bosses found his criticism of the Swinney leadership damaged its interests in the run-up to the SNP's poor European election showing in 2004, where it failed to overtake Labour. Mr Swinney quit as leader, accepting responsibility for failing to sell the party's message - but warned SNP members over the damage caused by \"the loose and dangerous talk of the few\". When the leaderless party turned to Mr Salmond, he responded by borrowing from Union Army General William Sherman, who, on being asked to run for president following the American Civil War, declared: \"If nominated I'll decline. If drafted I'll defer. And if elected I'll resign.\" But ever full of surprises, Mr Salmond entered the leadership race, \"with a degree of surprise and humility, but with a renewed determination\". Essentially, as he put it himself: \"I changed my mind.\"  Nobody thought the 2007 Scottish election result could be so close. In the end, the SNP won the election by one seat, while Mr Salmond returned to Holyrood as MSP for Gordon. With the SNP's pro-independence stance ruling out a coalition with one of the other big parties, the party forged ahead as a minority government. The SNP government had promised to seek consensus on an issue-by-issue basis, but when the opposition parties thought ministers were being disingenuous, they converged to reject the Scottish budget in 2009. It was passed on the second attempt, but served as a reminder to the SNP the delicate position it was in. Other key manifesto commitments also ran into trouble - plans to replace council tax with local income tax were dropped due to lack of support, while ambitious plans to cut class sizes in the early primary school years ran into problems. Eventually, the bill on an independence referendum was ditched. Although the SNP's focus had become the Scottish government, it was keen not to lose sight of its status beyond the Holyrood bubble and, in 2009, won the largest share of the Scottish vote in the European election for the first time. Continuing its knack for winning safe Labour seats in by-elections, the SNP delivered a crushing blow to Labour, winning Glasgow East by overturning a majority of 13,507 to win by just a few hundred votes. The SNP went into the 2011 election campaign with Labour leading in the polls, but the party failed to repeat this success a few months later in the Glenrothes by-election and, later, in Glasgow North East. In a story that bore echoes of the past for the SNP, the 2010 UK election saw Labour regain Glasgow East. The 2011 Holyrood election was seen by some as Labour's to lose. In the event, that's exactly what happened. Despite polls predicting a Labour lead over the SNP of up to 15 points, the nationalists threw themselves into the campaign. They said their positive campaign, versus Labour's negativity, was what won it for them. The SNP's 2007 win was rightly described as a historic one - but, four years later, the party re-wrote the history books. The part-PR/part-constituency system at Holyrood was essentially designed to keep any one party (ie, the SNP) from winning an overall majority. Scotland's first majority government named the date for the referendum as 18 September 2014, and launched its prospectus for the future in a White Paper. But before all that, there was one big hurdle to clear. The SNP's opposition to all things nuclear has always been as fundamental as its support for independence itself. For many years it opposed membership of Nato, characterising the security alliance as one with a \"first-strike\" nuclear policy. SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said a fresh approach was needed ahead of the referendum - although part of the argument for Nato within the SNP rested on a pragmatic calculation that most voters favoured membership. And so, at the party's 2012 conference, members voted to end the decades-old opposition to Nato membership. But the decision didn't come without cost, and after a heated debate which invoked memories of SNP conferences past, two MSPs - Jean Urquhart and John Finnie - quit the party. But it seemed the party managed to move on from the episode, and today, the SNP, with its 25,000-strong membership, has truly come a long way since the fringes of 1934. But it now faces what could be a make-or-break challenge. Labour veteran George Robertson famously quipped devolution would \"kill nationalism stone dead\". But, with the SNP claiming rising support for a \"Yes\" vote, could the situation now be more akin to comments by another Labour stalwart, Tam Dalyell, who described devolution as \"a motorway to independence with no U-turns and no exits?\" It's a question which will not only define the future of Britain, but the future of the Scottish National Party.

        "article": "Maria Miller has resigned as culture secretary after being forced to repay \u00a35,800 in mortgage payments she over-claimed on her parliamentary expenses. These happened before the rules changed, but could it happen again with another MP? MPs have a divided work life, having to spend time both at Westminster and in their constituencies. This has long been recognised in the expenses system. Until 2010 all MPs - except those with seats in inner London - could claim up to \u00a324,000 a year towards buying, furnishing and renovating a second home.  This could include mortgage interest payments, meaning that increases in the values of properties (usually in London) were effectively being subsidised. After the 2009 expenses scandal broke, abuses of the system and apparent use of taxpayers' money to boost MPs' property portfolios and personal wealth led to demands for change. The rules were overhauled, starting after the 2010 general election for new MPs. Returning MPs were given a transitional period, lasting until 2012. Under the new system, MPs were allowed to claim a maximum of \u00a31,450 a month to rent - not buy - a second home. Mortgage assistance was thrown out. Also, the number of MPs allowed to claim any help with accommodation was reduced. All those who have constituencies within 20 miles - or 60 minutes - of central London are now banned from getting rent subsidies. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) was not given any retrospective powers to reclaim profits made on homes prior to 2010 for taxpayers. However, it was allowed to do so for the pre-2010 MPs who continued to claim mortgage interest payments from the 2010 election until 2012. IPSA ordered those who did so to have their second homes valued by a chartered surveyor at the beginning and the end of the period. If they had gone up in price, they had to repay up to 100% of the increase, depending on what portion of the mortgage interest had been funded by the taxpayer. There may still be MPs who overclaimed on their mortgages under the old system. House of Commons Leader Andrew Lansley has said as much. As time passes, the number affected is likely to dwindle, with the newer MPs unaffected by the previous system. But it is difficult to rule out another situation like Mrs Miller's. And mortgage expense claims will continue to be scrutinised. ",
