Peter Hyman, now a head teacher, told the TES it was a moral issue that young people be taught to speak eloquently. He also criticised the government's decision to downgrade speaking and listening in GCSE English. The government said it wanted all pupils to be able to speak in public, make presentations and debate.  It added that its English curriculum in primary and secondary schools places a far greater emphasis on the spoken word. But changes to GCSE English means there are no longer any marks awarded in the final exam for speaking and listening. Mr Hyman is a former speech-writer for Tony Blair who now runs School 21 - a free school in Newham, east London. He told the Times Educational Supplement that speaking and listening was an \"undervalued area of literacy\". Instead, the spoken word should be \"built into the DNA of the school\", he said. \"Speaking eloquently is a moral issue because to find your voice both literally and metaphorically and be able to communicate your ideas and your passions is crucial to how they are going to be a success in the world,\" he said.  \"If you can speak and articulate yourself properly that will happen. \"But it's also the number-one issue that employers put in all their surveys: they want good oral communication.  \"We've got to dispel the myth of the grunting teenager, the monosyllabic teenager that make employers say, 'I've got this person who I know on paper is quite good, but they can't string a sentence together.'\" Despite its importance, Mr Hyman said the general trend was moving further away from encouraging pupils to develop their speaking and communication skills. The Department for Education said in a statement: \"The primary curriculum is clear that all teachers should develop their pupils' vocabulary and provide extra support where necessary. Speaking also plays a vital role in all other subjects, including maths and science. \"In addition, we have given all schools the freedom to set the length of the school day, with many already using these freedoms to run extra-curricular activities, such as debating competitions.\" It added that in primary school, children were expected, to be able to listen and respond appropriately to adults and their peers, ask relevant questions to extend their understanding and knowledge and articulate and justify answers, arguments and opinions.

        "article": "The government's \"overblown rhetoric\" on efforts to bring down immigration has contributed to a drop in students doing technology, engineering and maths courses at UK universities, peers say. The Lords Science and Technology Committee said \"inflammatory\" media coverage and people's \"perception of the rules\" were a deterrent. The UK was seen as an \"unwelcoming destination\", it added. But the government said the peers' report lacked \"clear evidence\". It said it was controlling immigration while \"attracting the brightest and the best\". Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wants to get the level of net migration - the difference between the number of people coming in and leaving - down to \"tens of thousands\" by 2015. Since April 2012, foreign students have faced stricter visa regulations, in an effort to cut down on bogus immigrants. But the government stresses that there is no cap on the number of people legitimately coming to the UK to study. The number of students studying science, technology and maths (Stem) subjects - including courses such as medicine, architecture and computer science - fell  by more than 10% from 58,815 in 2010-11 to 52,905 in 2012-13. The committee's report said: \"It was put to us on numerous occasions that it was not the immigration rules as such that were deterring students, but their perception of the rules as a result of overblown rhetoric from ministers and sometimes inflammatory media coverage in the UK and in overseas countries.\" It added: \"The UK was seen as a destination that was unwelcoming to some international students.\" But the report said the evidence \"pointed to difficulties beyond simply those of perception\", with the \"complexity and instability\" of the immigration rules also posing problems. \"The UK's offer to prospective international students remains a good one; it is founded on academic excellence, but it has been diminished by perceived and real barriers so that the overall offer is not as competitive as it needs to be,\" the peers said. Ministers have set out plans to increase the number of international students by up to 20% over the next five years. But the committee said: \"The government maintain that they emphatically welcome international students, unfortunately, elements of policy and perception are working against this admirable aim. \"The view within government that current policies are working well is disconnected from the concerns we repeatedly heard.\" But a Home Office spokesman said: \"We do not accept that the UK's immigration rules are deterring international students and there is no clear evidence in the report to support that argument - where some courses and countries have seen falling numbers, other countries and courses are on the rise.\" He said the UK remained \"the second most popular destination for international higher education students\", with enrolments from \"key markets\", such as China, Malaysia and Hong Kong increasing. The spokesman added: \"The student visa system we inherited was weak and open to widespread abuse. We are controlling immigration while still attracting the brightest and the best - as the published figures show.\" ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Work needed ranges from a new microwave or dishwasher to a full refurbishment, as Alex Forsyth reports More than 2,700 schools in England will need to improve kitchens to provide free meals for infant school children, according to new figures. Freedom of Information figures obtained by the BBC found this to be about one in three schools assessed so far. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced the policy at last year's Liberal Democrat conference. The Department for Education has provided funding for improvements and said it is offering support to schools.  there are more than 16,800 state primary schools in England. The work needed ranges from a new microwave or dishwasher to a full refurbishment. The figures also showed that more than 1,700 schools had no kitchen at all.  These will have hot meals delivered by external caterers, or cooked at neighbouring schools and transported in as many currently do. Some of the 152 local authorities who provided information said their funding allocation was adequate to make necessary improvements, others said it fell short of estimated costs.  We are providing \u00a3150m to improve kitchens and dining facilities\u201d In many schools lunchtimes will be staggered or extended in order to seat all pupils in small halls.  Schools Minister David Laws told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"not complacent\" about the problems, but a service set up to help introduce the policy was \"yet to find a school that with the right support and advice cannot actually deal with these issues\". \"The anecdotal evidence and the noise that you tend to get will tend to be from what can sometimes be a small minority of schools, and I take their concerns seriously,\" he said. \"But what you don't hear about, and what I do hear about, is the vast majority of schools that are on track to deliver this.\"  Critics say the deputy prime minister's policy was rushed through and is proving to hard to implement. Some schools may have to offer sandwiches in September instead of hot meals. A Department for Education spokesman said: \"School lunches for all infant children will save parents money, improve children's education and make sure more children eat a healthy and nutritious meal at least once a day. \"Universal free school meals have already been shown to work in the pilot schemes run by the Department for Education and Department of Health in 2009. \"Indeed, schools have had longer to prepare for the introduction of universal free school meals this September than schools in those pilot areas had in 2009. \"Schools are receiving a huge amount of support to provide free school meals. We are providing \u00a3150m to improve kitchens and dining facilities, as well as an additional \u00a322.5m specifically to help smaller schools to provide these meals.\" Under the scheme, all Reception, Year 1 and Year 2 children in state-funded schools in England will be entitled to free school meals from September.

        "article": "New heights of competitive parenting are being prompted by young pupils taking home a classroom teddy bear and recording what they get up to. Many schools use cuddly toys to encourage parents to get active with their child and pupils to practise writing and storytelling skills. But the TES says the recording of these activities in a special book is leading to one-upmanship among parents. Some schools say parent politics have led them to stop using the toys. Thousands of primary schoolchildren wait excitedly every Friday to see if it is their turn to take home the Sarah the Donkey or the Murphy the Monkey. The cuddly toys usually come with an exercise book with little anecdotes and photos or drawings demonstrating what previous children, their parents and the toy got up to. And the latest host family are encouraged to do likewise. The TES says anecdotes from teachers suggest some parents have become overcompetitive, using the teddy bear's diary to showcase their impressive array of weekend activities. Instead of simple visits to the park or walks in the country, teachers report that bears have spent weekends attending orchestra rehearsals, piloting ships and enjoying high-profile events. Conversely, some parents appear to compete to show their disinterest in the whole idea. One teacher told the TES they had received the class bear diary with a photo caption, saying: \"The bear wandered aimlessly around B&Q, looking at taps.\" TES editor Ann Mroz said reviews of postings in online forums suggested \"parents find themselves nosing through the bear's diary to see what it has been up to on previous weekends and they start to judge and compare. \"We've seen, through online discussion boards, that some parents have been reduced to tears over having the bear for the weekend. \"Some parents work all weekend, while others struggle with the English language to the point that just writing the report becomes a stressful exercise. \"It's unfair that they should be judged harshly by other parents as a result.\" She adds: \"The class bear is a great teacher tool but some simple changes could really help take the edge off the competitiveness.\" ",

        "article": "England's teenagers are \"significantly above average\" in problem-solving skills, according to the results of international tests. After many disappointments in international school tests, these latest global rankings from the OECD put England in 11th place. The OECD puts England as second highest in Europe, behind Finland, in tests of how pupils can apply their knowledge. Singapore and South Korea were top in tests taken by 15-year-olds. These problem-solving tests were taken at the same time as the Pisa tests, which compare how well pupils perform in maths, reading and science. Rather than testing theoretical knowledge, the problem-solving tests examined how well teenagers could use their knowledge in practical questions. For example, it presented pupils with a range of information about different types of train tickets and asked them to work out the cheapest price for a journey. Good problem solving skills give young people an edge in the world of work\u201d These problem-solving tests were an optional extra following the Pisa tests taken in 2012 - and were taken by 44 out of the 65 countries and administrations in the Pisa rankings. About 85,000 pupils took these tests, as a sample representing 19 million 15-year-olds. In England, the sample was based on 137 schools. It found that pupils in England were much better than their performance in Pisa tests, where they failed to make the top 20 in any subject. The OECD's Michael Davidson suggested that Asian countries were particularly strong at learning information, but it seemed that pupils in England were above average at how this information was creatively applied. The top performers remained Asian countries and education systems - but the Chinese city of Shanghai, which had been the top performer in Pisa tests, is ranked sixth in these more practical tests. China does not compete as a whole country, but some of its cities and regions participate separately. England's pupils' performance puts them above countries such as Germany, the United States and Sweden. These problem-solving skills were going to be essential for the future job chances of young people, said the OECD's Francesco Avvisati. Across the countries and cities taking part, boys were more likely to be among the top performers. But in England, there was no significant gender difference. There were also big regional differences. Northern Italy had some of the best results in the world, while schools in southern Italy were far below average. Colombia, Bulgaria and Uruguay had the lowest results. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman described the results as \"excellent news\". \"Graduates need core knowledge in subjects like maths and English, but they also need to be able to apply this to tackle complex and unpredictable tasks with confidence,\" said Mr Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. \"Good problem-solving skills give young people an edge in the world of work and prepare them to move into top jobs and leadership positions.\" A Department for Education spokesman said the test results showed the strength in problem solving. \"But they also confirm that generally those who perform best in maths, reading and science - Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong and South Korea - are also those who do best in problem solving. \"This connection between the core subjects and problem solving underlines why we are focusing on the basics in the rigorous new primary curriculum, and why reformed GCSEs and A-levels will have open-ended questions which encourage lateral thinking.\" Source: OECD 1.

        "article": "A government parenting class pilot scheme has been dubbed a \"flop\" after just 4% of eligible parents took part. The CanParent scheme which saw parents given \u00a3100 to spend on classes ended up costing \u00a31,088 per parent, figures obtained by Labour suggest. Shadow children and families minister Lucy Powell described the scheme which attracted just 2,000 out of a possible 55,200 as an \"embarrassing failure\". The government said it would continue to work closely with CanParent. The CanParent initiative offered classes for every parent and carer of children up to the age of five in three local authorities - Middlesbrough, Camden and High Peak between June 2012 and March 2014.  More than 50,000 parents in CanParent areas were able to access vouchers worth \u00a3100 to spend on classes through health visitors, midwives, doctor's surgeries and children's centres - and were available at branches of Boots.  But Ms Powell discovered from a Parliamentary Question that just 4% of parents took part in the scheme which cost \u00a32m. The scheme was launched in 2011 by the then children's minister Sarah Teather and ran between April 2012 and January 2014. At the time, David Cameron said: \"Parents want help. It is in our interest as a society to help people bring up their children.\" The classes, provided by parenting experts, covered areas such as communication and listening skills, managing conflict and \"strengthening positive relationships in the family\", as well as the importance of parents working as a team. Discipline was also to be stressed, with \"firm, fair and consistent approaches\" encouraged and the importance of \"boundaries\" being set out for children. And there was advice on appropriate play for children's age and development. Ms Powell said: \"Parenting classes are a valued early intervention service but parents struggling under a cost-of-living crisis to balance work and family life are finding it harder and harder to access the help they need.\"  The Department for Education said: \"We are committed to helping parents access the vital help and advice they need in the early years of their child's life.\" \"CanParent offers a wide range of high quality, universal parenting classes and 99% of those who completed their course said they would recommend classes to others.\" ",

        "article": "There have been almost 10,000 violent attacks on places of education in recent years, according to the biggest ever international study of how schools and universities are targeted by acts of aggression. These included the murder of staff and students and the destruction of buildings in bomb and arson attacks, in countries including Pakistan, Colombia, Somalia and Syria. This stark account of violence against education between 2009 and 2013 has been published by a coalition of human rights groups, aid organisations and United Nations agencies. The Education Under Attack report, published in New York on Thursday, reveals the extent to which education has been subjected to deliberate acts of violence. These are not cases of schools and their staff \"just caught in the crossfire\", says Diya Nijhowne, director of the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack. \"They are bombed, burned, shot, threatened, and abducted precisely because of their connection to education.\" There were 9,600 attacks worldwide, with incidents recorded in 70 countries, with the worst problems in Africa and parts of Asia and South America. There was a pattern of deliberate attacks in 30 of these countries, where such violence was used as a \"tactic of war\", said Ms Nijhowne. These figures do not include the type of school shootings carried out against pupils and staff at Sandy Hook in the US in 2012. The country with the greatest number of attacks was Pakistan, with the most common assault being the blowing up of school buildings. Colombia was the most dangerous place to be a teacher, with 140 murders and thousands of death threats. For school pupils, Somalia was the country where children were most likely to be pressed into becoming soldiers. Syria's conflict has seen deadly attacks at universities in Aleppo and Damascus and there were high levels of attacks on students in Yemen and Sudan. The perpetrators have included government forces, armed insurgents, terror groups and criminal gangs. They have committed murders, abductions and intimidation. The shooting of Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai by Taliban opponents of girls' education in 2012 focused global attention on such attacks on education. But this study shows that this was far from an isolated case and that staff and pupils have been singled out for deliberate violence in many different conflicts and ideological battlegrounds. This week in north-east Nigeria at least 29 teenage boys were killed in a massacre at a boarding school. Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group opposed to western education, is suspected of carrying out the attack. The Education Under Attack report says that 30 teachers were shot dead in Nigeria last year, including some in front of a class. Attacks on education can be a proxy for other conflicts, such as trying to undermine a government symbol or trying to promote a political, religious or ideological message or to terrorise another community. In Afghanistan and Pakistan there have been violent attacks against the education of women. Or else targeting students can be a way of pursuing a sectarian dispute. In Burma, also known as Myanmar, last year, a Buddhist nationalist mob set upon boys from a Muslim school, hacking dozens to death. In 2010, in Iraq an escorted convoy of Christian students travelling to university were the victims of a car bomb attack. There can also be more specific campaigns. In Mexico there were six bomb attacks on universities by a group opposed to nanotechnology research. Teachers in Colombia have faced violence from armed groups, including rival paramilitary forces and criminal gangs.  As community leaders they are targeted by groups wanting to intimidate local people or to recruit school pupils into armed gangs. The impact of violence can reach beyond the individual victims. Terrorising academics and students in university can destroy the research capacity of an economy, warns the report, and trigger the departure of highly-skilled young people. Intellectual curiosity and free speech, necessary in academic life, can be undermined by the threat of violence, with fear prompting \"self-censorship\" and a brain drain to other safer countries. There are also concerns about armed groups occupying educational premises, using them as barracks or training bases or sometimes as detention centres or even places of torture. In 24 of the 30 countries worst affected by attacks on education, there were cases of schools being taken over by military forces. This also puts buildings at risk from attacks from opposing forces, says the report's lead researcher, Brendan O'Malley. In Somalia, the report says, schools have been used as firing positions and faced incoming rockets, while the classrooms were still being used by pupils. The study calls for the creation of \"safe zones\" around schools and wants combatants to recognise the need to protect places of education. Mr O'Malley says a positive step would be a common agreement \"not to use schools for military purposes\". There are also calls for a clearer path for investigating and prosecuting the perpetrators of acts of violence against schools and their staff and pupils. As well as the loss of life, violent conflict is one of the biggest causes of a loss of education. About half of the 57 million children without access to any school place live in areas disrupted by war and violence. \"It's not just the killings that spread fear and blight lives. The relentless destruction of schools in some areas of conflict is depriving whole cohorts of children of an education,\" says Mr O'Malley. \"There is a knock-on effect on social and economic development in places that can least afford to be held back. \"Where the government lacks the capacity or will to repair damaged schools, the effects can be felt for years after the attacks have happened.\" ",

        "article": "The number of overseas students taking up places at England's universities decreased by 4,595 in one year - the first fall in 29 years. International and EU student numbers fell from 311,800 in 2011-12 to 307,205 in 2012-13, the Higher Education Funding Council for England reports. Since April 2012, foreign students have faced stricter visa regulations. But the government stressed that there was no cap on the number of legitimate students who can study here. The Hefce report - Global demand for English higher education - said there was a notable decline  in the number of entrants from South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan, at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The number of Indian students fell from 18,535 in 2010-11 to 13,250 in 2011-12 and further to 10,235 in 2012/13. In 2010-11 the number of Pakistani students was 4,580, but this fell by 38% to 2,825 in 2012/13. The data also shows the number of full-time EU undergraduates fell by almost a quarter in just one year - from 23,440 in 2011-12 to 17,890 in 2012-13 after years of increasing numbers. These students have to pay the same fees as UK students and Hefce puts the decline in numbers down to the increase in tuition fees in September 2012. The report said the fall in overseas students was particularly noticeable in the postgraduate market. Between 2010-11 and 2012-13, the numbers of international students starting full-time postgraduate courses in England decreased by 985 from 72,245 to 71,260. The data also shows Chinese students account for 23% (26,860) of the total full-time postgraduate numbers in England, while UK students account for 26% (30,320)  Under the Tier 4 visa regime, students face tougher questions about their destination, limits on their ability to work and tighter rules on their English-language capability.  Critics of the rules said they would discourage international students - who are worth as much as \u00a33bn  a year to UK universities - from studying here and give the impression that the UK was not a welcoming destination. Last May, Business Secretary Vince Cable warned that the public debate about immigration was in danger of damaging the \"economically valuable\" recruitment of overseas students to the UK. Mr Cable said  overseas students had become caught up in the \"public panic\" over migrant numbers. Hefce chief executive, Professor Madeleine Atkins, said the analysis increased understanding of global demand for English higher education.  \"International students enrich our universities and colleges - and our society - academically, culturally, and through their contribution to the economy,\" she said.  \"Supporting high-quality international education is a crucial part of ensuring that the UK continues to engage with, and benefit from, the increasingly interconnected world.\" A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said:  \"International students make a huge contribution - boosting our economy and enhancing our cultural life. \"That is why there is no cap on the number of legitimate students who can study here. By working with other countries we will continue to attract international students and promote the UK's expertise in education.\" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \"If the UK wants to fulfil its potential in this growth area, we need policies to attract qualified international students to the UK.  \"This is why in the run up to the general election, Universities UK will be calling for a growth strategy for international students.  \"This should be supported by a welcoming climate for genuine international students, with visa and immigration rules that are proportionate and properly communicated.\" General secretary of the Universities and Colleges Union, Sally Hunt, said: \"As we face continued uncertainty about the future of funding for our universities, the government should be doing more to encourage foreign students. \"Ministers need to recognise that attempts to sound tough on immigration at home are also reported elsewhere and it is not surprising if students consider studying in the countries that make an effort to welcome them.\" ",

        "article": "The sound of excitable children squealing with joy fills the auditorium of the Royal Festival Hall. On the stage, 900 five-, six- and seven-year-olds sit cross legged. \"Five, four, three, two, one and s-s-sh!\" says the conductor. \"Well done children. Very quiet.\" They launch into their first number, with wobbly legs and dry lips over missing front teeth - but as it gets into full swing, they start to relax and make their matching dance movements with ever-growing confidence.  A rainbow of different coloured uniformed arms, representing the 50 schools taking part in the Lambeth Music Festival, go up like a Mexican wave across the stage. And the audience of proud parents respond by raising their iPads and mobile phones to record the occasion. As the repertoire progresses, small sections get a little over-excited with their hand movements and the odd person gets an unintentional smack in the face. But they don't seem bothered - it's just too exciting. This mass choral effort is the result of months of hard work by pupils, their class teachers and the staff from Lambeth Music Service. Festival organiser, Oliver Bayley, says: \"In a lot of the schools the kids have big voices but when it comes to performing, they can feel  really small. It's our job to help them with that. \"The effect, schools tell us, is that the children grow in confidence. It's quite daunting for a child, for an adult even, to perform on a stage of world renown like this.\" Started 13 years ago, the festival aims to give children the chance not only to sing and play together in a school, but across Lambeth, says Lambeth council's education improvement adviser Judith Hare.   When children are engaged with music and listening to music there is no disruptive behaviour\u201d Encouraging involvement was not always so easy, Mrs Hare adds: \"When we started we had quite a few children from disadvantaged backgrounds who would not set foot in a place like the Royal Festival Hall because their parents thought it just wasn't for them.\" But now parents are milling around comfortably and excitably like the South Bank is a second home.  Taking part in a performance like this can be a seminal moment in a young person's life, she says, adding that there are also returns for children's self-esteem. \"With music, unlike sport where there has to be a winner, in music they are working together as a team for the benefit of the whole.\" Teacher Jennifer Ross has brought her Year 2 class of five- and six-year-olds along to the performance after spending the past few months drip-feeding them the festival songs at every opportunity. \"The benefit of doing a whole class performance is that it really works well in terms of class cohesion,\" she says. She says the whole experience has also improved the children's behaviour and ability to learn.  \"When children are engaged with music and listening to music there is no disruptive behaviour because they are so fully engaged with what's going on,\" she says. Because of Lambeth's inner-city location, there are many pupils who have English as an additional language or are coping with substantial disadvantage. Take the very smiley six-year-old Pauline - a recent arrival from Cambodia. \"When she arrived she was classed as having Stage 1 or very basic English,\" says Ms Ross.  \"There were many times when she couldn't get across how she felt. But through all the singing and dancing, she has gained confidence and developed her speaking.\" And this educational side-effect of the choral experience was part of the reason Lambeth set up the annual children's music festival. Mrs Hare says: \"There is a lot of research to show that if you play a musical instrument - the connections in the brain are stronger. People with a music background tend to achieve more academically.\" The Lambeth Music Service, with its \u00a3250,000 annual state funding, borrows much from its perhaps better known Venezuelan counterpart, El Sistema - a state-run organisation that oversees scores of youth orchestras, instrumental training programmes and choirs.  El Sistema has 31 symphony orchestras, and up to 370,000 children attend its music schools, studying intensively for 12 hours a week after school. Set up in 1975, El Sistema is a most resilient survivor of the troubled and changing nation and sends its musicians touring the globe's most famous concert halls so high is its standard. Head of Lambeth Music Service, Brendon La Page, says: \"Venezuela has had one of the most ridiculous political histories, and over the last few years there have been coups and internal wars, but El Sistema has survived all of this.\" Some 90% of El Sistema students are said to come from poor backgrounds, but some say it tends to be the children from the more organised families who access the opportunity. Meanwhile Lambeth's music service funding has been cut by about 20% over the past few years, says Mr La Page. But it is still managing to provide music tuition, based mainly on whole-class teaching, to all Lambeth pupils. \"Where we differ from El Sistema is that we cater for all 27,000 children across Lambeth's schools. We are messianic and completely committed to giving every child a high quality musical experience. \"No-one escapes,\" he says. And judging by the reluctance of these Lambeth children to leave the stage - they don't want to. The Simon Bolivar National Youth Choir of Venezuela will be joining the young Lambeth festival participants for some informal choral action before a more formal performance at the South Bank on Saturday. The events are part of Chorus Festival at the Royal Festival Hall. ",

        "article": "It's 20 years since The Spastics Society renamed itself Scope. Other disability charities have changed their names since. But in disability, what is a good name for a charity? In 1994 Blur and Oasis were slogging it out for the Britpop crown, Don't Forget Your Toothbrush was the hot TV show, John Major was our prime minister and people with cerebral palsy were still referred to as spastics.  Valerie Lang was on the executive council of the Spastics Society at the time. She has cerebral palsy and had been passionate about a name change for years before it eventually happened. \"I felt that we could not afford to stay with the name we had,\" she says. \"The name spastic was a playground term of abuse. Children would shout to each other 'You big spastic' every time someone was clumsy or even if they just disagreed with them.  \"Mothers with young babies who had cerebral palsy weren't seeking help from the society because they had heard the word used in playground parlance. I think it put the younger generation off.\"  Lang, now 74, says that people ceased to think of those with cerebral palsy as individuals. \"We might have a brain injury in common but we are all different and don't want to be put in a box labelled 'spastic'.\"  The charity made the change at an extraordinary general meeting in March 1994. The chairman at that time, Anthony Hewson, noted the tension in the room and was worried some of the wheelchair users in the room might \"wheel forward and lynch me\" if the wrong decision was made.  \"Scope\" was one of several names considered. Others were reminiscent of the single-word abstract names popular with companies in the 1990s - Clipper, Clasp, Canopy, Patch, Ibex, Adepta, Tasq, Fulcrum, Cognosis, Capability. Other more traditional names under discussion included Action Cerebral Palsy and the Cerebral Palsy Society.  Perhaps sadly, one of the big factors in choosing Scope, a largely neutral name with no obvious link to disability or cerebral palsy, was that it could not be turned into a term of abuse.  Since that time, other disability charities have come onto the scene with positive names such as Enable or Ability. Arguably this approach has itself become somewhat cliched, and may eventually come back to haunt the charities because of their earnest positivity. It's terribly difficult to get it right when it comes to disability which - despite undoubtedly improving attitudes - is still an uneasy subject matter.  Perhaps the most notable and dramatic of recent charity name changes is that of the Royal National Institute of Deaf People (RNID), which is now Action on Hearing Loss.  It was an important moment in our transition from being a traditional charity... to being an organisation that's about working alongside disabled people\u201d Chief Executive Paul Breckell says it was a strategic decision. The name is a better reflection of the charity's work, he explains, as it doesn't only work with deaf people. He says many people weren't very aware of the charity with its four-letter brand: \"The public confused us with similar names like RNIB, RNLI and RSPB. \"People don't always know what acronyms mean, they're clumsy and clunky and words like 'National Institute' have a tendency to date an organisation.\"  Mencap chooses to hold onto its name despite it being a splicing together of \"mentally handicapped\", a term now deemed inappropriate by many. Even the charity uses the phrase \"learning disability\" to describe the people it helps. (As a reminder of how far attitudes have changed, it's interesting to note that Mencap was actually called the Association of Parents of Backward Children when it was founded in 1946).  The charity defends its present name, and says that a change is not going to make any difference to the problems faced by people with learning disabilities. It points out that the name has, as it were, brand recognition and is widely recognised by the public and by politicians. Certainly, although the name may have its detractors, Mencap is a modern-thinking organisation which involves people with learning disabilities in its decision-making. Though seen as a model for changing brand name, Scope has never rebuilt its brand awareness. Whereas 90% used to know what the Spastics Society was, only 64% answer \"yes\" when asked: \"have you heard of Scope?\" However, the charity says that although awareness may have declined, charitable income has not been affected.  Richard Hawkes, Scope's chief executive, says it was a real risk to drop one of the UK's best-known charity brand names, but it was important to make a strong statement that attitudes towards disabled people needed to change. \"It was an important moment in our transition from being a traditional charity that helped vulnerable beneficiaries to being an organisation that's about working alongside disabled people to make change happen. \"Changing the name meant we could be side by side with all disabled people - who at that time were campaigning for important changes, like the introduction of the Disability Discrimination Act.\" ",
