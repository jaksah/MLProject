Protests on social media say she is a controversial figure after revelations of widespread wiretapping on US citizens during her time in office. A petition has been launched inviting supporters to boycott the firm.  However some analysts claim the bigger concerns for the file-sharing company are competing services. Following the launch of Mailbox for Android and the wider implementation of Dropbox for Business, the company also announced the addition of Condoleezza Rice as a new board member. We're honoured to be adding someone as brilliant and accomplished as Dr Rice to our team.\u201d Ms Rice, who served as former President George W Bush's Secretary of State from 2005 to 2009 and National Security Adviser 2001 - 2005, was appointed by the company to expand its global footprint, according to its  . However, this has been condemned by some Dropbox users who have launched a campaign.  Voicing concerns on social media, some have said it is inappropriate for the file-sharing company to hire Ms Rice, accusing her of being involved in   during her time in office. Those pressing Dropbox to revoke Ms Rice's appointment are using the hashtag #DropDropbox in an attempt to boycott the company. A   has also been created which amassed approximately 3,000 signatures in its first few hours. Another   said: \"This is deeply disturbing, and anyone - or any business - who values ethics should be concerned,\" before listing a number of Dropbox alternatives for those who wish to boycott the company. It also says Ms Rice should not hold power at Dropbox because of her role in the Iraq war. However, Chris Green, Principal Technology Analyst of Davies  , told the BBC that most users probably wouldn't be concerned over Ms Rice's appointment. \"The vast majority of the company's 275 million users are unlikely to be swayed or concerned by the short-term negative PR that Condoleezza Rice's appointment is generating for Dropbox,\" he said. \"The backlash is fuelled far more by pent-up anger at the administration she served in than a genuine concern for the security of Dropbox users' data.  The bigger concern for Dropbox, says Mr Green, is the growing competition it faces, which includes big names such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon. All of them \"are offering competing services with either more free storage or more compelling commercial packages than Dropbox offers.\" The company has yet to release an official statement addressing the backlash, but a recent Dropbox blog post said: \"We're honoured to be adding someone as brilliant and accomplished as Ms Rice to our team.\" ",

        "article": "The BBC was \"far too complacent\" in its handling of a failed IT project that cost licence fee payers \u00a398.4m.  The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was intended to move the BBC away from using and storing video tape. But it was scrapped, with almost no results, after five years of development.  After investigating the demise of the project,  has branded the programme \"a complete failure\". Chairman Margaret Hodge said the BBC needed to \"overhaul\" its approach to such projects, to \"safeguard licence fee payers' money\". The BBC originally approved DMI in 2006. It was supposed to produce new editing tools, an online archive of the BBC's programmes and a new database. Technology company Siemens was hired to develop the project in February 2008, and it was expected to be completed the following year. However, after a series of delays, the project was brought in-house, There it floundered until last May, when the BBC's incoming director general, Tony Hall, admitted it had \"wasted a huge amount of licence fee payers' money\". The gross estimate of the amount spent on DMI was \u00a3125.9m, although the BBC claims to have recouped \u00a327.5m of that. The BBC's technology chief, John Linwood, was sacked in July 2013 over the project's demise. A previous report, by the National Audit Office (NAO), blamed \"confusion and a lack of planning\" for the failure. It said that senior executives failed to take control of the project when it ran into trouble and \"did not appear to appreciate the extent of the problems until a late stage\". The PAC published its own findings on Thursday. It reiterated several of the points raised in earlier reports and criticised the BBC for its failure to alert MPs of the problems. \"When my committee examined the DMI's progress in February 2011, the BBC told us that the DMI was... absolutely essential... and that a lot of the BBC's future was tied up in the successful delivery of the DMI,\" said Ms Hodge. \"The BBC also told us that it was using the DMI to make many programmes and was on track to complete the system in 2011 with no further delays.  \"This turned out not to be the case. In reality the BBC only ever used the DMI to make one programme, called Bang Goes the Theory. \"The BBC was far too complacent about the high risks involved in taking it in-house. No single individual had overall responsibility or accountability for delivering the DMI and achieving the benefits, or took ownership of problems when they arose.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"Tony Hall was right to scrap the DMI project when he took over as director general last year. As we said at the time, the BBC didn't get DMI right and we apologised to licence fee payers.  \"Since then we have completely overhauled how these projects are delivered so that there is crystal clear accountability and transparency.\" A spokeswoman for the BBC Trust, the corporation's governing body, said: \"As we have said before, this represented an unacceptable loss to licence fee payers. \"Acting on the conclusions of previous reports into DMI, we have strengthened reporting to the Trust so that problems are spotted early and dealt with quickly.  \"We are also carrying out follow up reviews once projects are completed to make sure the lessons from DMI are being implemented.\" ",

        "article": "A British scientist whose work made it possible for hard disks to radically expand in size has been awarded the Millennium Technology Prize. Prof Stuart Parkin developed a type of data-reading head capable of detecting weaker and smaller signals than had previously been possible. The innovation allowed more information to be stored on each disk platter. The foundation behind the award said he had made Facebook, Google, Amazon and other online services possible. \"Parkin is a leading innovator in the field of spintronics, which relies on the magnetic spin of electrons rather than their charge to store bits and is one of the most successful fields of nanotechnology yet,\" said Technology Academy Finland. \"[His] innovations have led to a huge expansion of data acquisition and storage capacities, which in turn have underpinned the evolution of large data centres and cloud services, social networks, music and film distribution online.\" Previous winners of the one million euro ($1.38m; \u00a3824,000) award - which is announced every other year - include web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and the Linux operating system kernel developer Linus Torvalds. Those selected are judged to have invented something that either has changed or has the power to change people's lives for the better, ideally on a global scale. Prof Parkin's field of expertise is a branch of physics called spintronics - or spin electronics.  In this case, the word \"spin\" refers to a quantum mechanical property of an electron that can be likened to a planet turning around its axis.  Just as planets can rotate clockwise or anti-clockwise, electrons are said to be able to spin up or down - an action that sets up a magnetic field. The analogy is not perfect, but in short the phenomenon can be exploited to store bits of data on atomically-thin magnetic structures. Prof Parkin made this possible by building on the observations of two Nobel Prize winners - Albert Fert and Peter Grunberg - to create a highly sensitive detector capable of discerning small magnetic fields at room temperature. \"The spin valve sensing device allowed one to detect much tinier magnetic fields and therefore smaller magnetic regions in a magnetic disk drive,\" he explained to the BBC. \"The information in a disk drive is basically stored as magnetic regions in a very thin magnetic film.  \"So, now we could detect much smaller regions than was possible before, in fact about 1,000 times smaller because of the extreme sensitivity of the spin valve sensing device.\" The work was carried out for IBM, and the firm commercialised the technology in 1997. It soon became an industry standard, allowing disk capacity to quadruple roughly once a year for several years. That not only made it possible to store more information in computers but also meant it became affordable to build giant data centres. \"The modern world is sustained by our ability to store all our information in magnetic disk drives essentially in the cloud, so that you can instantaneously carry out Google searches, instantly stream music and movies,\" added Prof Parkin. \"None of those things would be possible without the immense capacities of magnetic disk drives at the very low cost that is possible today... thanks to this spintronic sensing device.\" The professor continues to work for IBM, and is hoping to spearhead a further storage revolution with an experimental technology he is developing for the firm called Racetrack memory. The goal is to exploit spintronics to create a new type of storage that would consume less energy than magnetic disk drives but be as high-performing as solid-state flash memory - a more expensive alternative. \"By building a three-dimensional device with tiny nanoscopic wires in which a whole series of magnetic regions are raced to and fro, it can increase the storage capacity of conventional solid-state memory 100-fold,\" he said. \"It would be as fast and reliable as conventional solid state memories but would be as cheap and capacious as a magnetic disk drive - basically containing the best of both worlds.\" While the professor is keen to highlight how his work has made it possible for the internet to offer vast amounts of information and entertainment, he acknowledges that the technology has also been used for more controversial purposes - including the storage and analysis of large amounts of information about the public by cyber-spy agencies. Even so, he said he had few regrets. \"Of course it's a concern if people misuse data if they can,\" he said. \"It's like any scientific discovery or development - it can be used for good and sometimes used for bad.  \"In my mind the goodness certainly outweighs any downside. The discoveries that can be made possible and the knowledge that can be gained by having access to the information certainly outweigh any negatives in my mind.\" ",

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) warned only Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and West Midlands had sufficient plans in place. It also found only 2% of police staff across 37 forces had been trained on investigating cybercrime. The report examined how prepared police are for a series of national threats. The capacity and capability of the police to respond to national threats is stronger in some areas than others\u201d Last year, the government identified five threats as priorities for police to prepare for. These are: As part of its Strategic Policing Requirement (SPR), the Home Office called for a nationally-required policing response to counter each of the threats. The report is the first in a series of inspections looking at how individual forces have responded to the guidelines. However, it found the response to national threats by individual forces has \"not changed appreciably\". HMIC inspectors said they were \"struck by how incomplete the police service's understanding of the national threats was\" and that more needs to be done \"collectively by all forces\". The report called for \"much greater attention\" from police leaders. \"The capacity and capability of the police to respond to national threats is stronger in some areas than others - with the police response to the cyber-threat being the least well developed,\" HMIC's Stephen Otter said. Police plans to deal with counter-terrorism, public order, civil emergencies and organised crime were in \"stark contrast\" with the capabilities for cyber-related threats. Inspectors found the ability to deal with cyber-threats remains \"largely absent\" in some forces and that some senior officers across England and Wales are still \"unsure of what constituted a large-scale cyber-incident\". The police must be able to operate very soon just as well in cyberspace as they do on the street\u201d They found forces were \"silent\" when it came to preventing cybercrime and protecting people from the harm it causes, despite the fact it is \"fast becoming a dominant method in the perpetration of crime. \"The police must be able to operate very soon just as well in cyberspace as they do on the street,\" the report said. According to the government's definition, a large-scale cyber-incident could be \"a criminal attack on a financial institution to gather data or money\" or an \"aggregated threat where many people or businesses across the UK are targeted\".  It also includes \"the response to a failure of technology on which communities depend and which may also be considered a civil emergency\".  The HMIC report covered police forces in England and Wales.  In Scotland, police have tried to tackle cybercrime by forming a \"cyber-resilience group\" with industry experts and academics, which aims to spread awareness of cybercrime and help businesses protect themselves.  Last year it was estimated cybercrime costs Scottish businesses \u00a35bn a year.  The Police Service of Northern Ireland has focused on protecting young people from the dangers of cybercrime aimed at individuals. Chief Constable Justine Curran, the national policing lead for public order at the Association of Chief Police Officers, said police had \"continued to improve\" and to \"develop our understanding of the threats we face\".  However, she said there was \"more to do to develop a clear, consistent approach,\" particularly when it comes to cybercrime, which she said remained \"a growing threat\". \"This report will assist chiefs and the College of Policing in this ongoing work and provide useful ideas for enhancement where this can be achieved within the current financial austerity across policing,\" she said.

Early adopters of 4K may be unable to take advantage of the new feature as the decoder required to view Netflix 4K videos is not built into early 4K televisions. There are currently few alternatives to overcome the problem. Shows available include House of Cards and \"some nature documentaries\". It has been confirmed by Netflix via   that 4K streaming is now live and available for a select number of programmes, including the second season of House of Cards. However, initial access to the service is limited, with older 4K televisions unable to stream the new high-quality content.  Most 4K televisions purchased before this year lack the H.265/HEVC decoder required to stream Netflix's ultra-HD service. Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings has said that an average speed of 15.6 Mbps would be required to stream its 4K content.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Netflix's chief executive discussed his 4K ambitions earlier this year This could pose additional problems for UK users, whose collective average download speed is below this threshold. \"Average broadband speeds in the UK are 7.6 megabits per second. You would need to have at least double that speed to watch 4K reliably on a streamed basis,\" IHS broadband analyst Richard Broughton   last November. \"Currently only 15% to 20% of households have the speeds necessary.\" Despite the increased demand for 4K, some commentators still have reservations about whether the human eye is truly capable of viewing the difference between 1080p and ultra-HD 4K resolutions.  The eye has a finite resolution, says  , former editor-in-chief of Home Entertainment Magazine, which makes most instances of extreme resolutions needless. Beyond the home, for example in cinemas, the use of 4K and higher remains desirable for many, with a   from Sony stating: \"4K makes a visible difference on screens big and small... 4K projection is scalable, accommodating 4K, 2K, HD and other digital content.\" Netflix is thought to have been working on its 4K streaming service since last November.

Satellites of the GLONASS network experienced a half-day outage when bad data was uploaded to spacecraft.  map shows a GLONASS receiver at Harwich giving corrupted position fixes that were off by more than 50km. The Authorities say the 2 April event is a timely reminder that alternatives to satellite navigation are essential. The GLA themselves are supporting a system in the UK and Ireland called eLoran, which transmits long-range position, navigation and timing signals from a ground-based radio network. Its primary use is for ships and others in the maritime sector, but there is a feeling also that eLoran could provide a robust back-up for GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo when it arrives. Galileo is the European sat-nav system, which is in the process of roll-out. A   found that the UK was becoming dangerously over-reliant on what are termed Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Use of space-borne positioning and timing data is now widespread, in everything from freight movement to synchronisation of computer networks. The academy found that too few of these applications were able to lean on alternatives should the primary sat-nav signals go down. Receivers needed to be capable of switching seamlessly between a variety of data sources, the RAEng expert panel argued. \"GLONASS is used by quite a lot of people, actually; the iPhone-5 can pick up its signals,\" explained Prof David Last, a consultant engineer and past president of the Royal Institute of Navigation. \"What we saw last week was many people being affected by the GLONASS failure even with receivers that were also picking up GPS.   \"The lesson that comes out of this is not just that satellite-navigation systems are vulnerable, but that you don't get a protection by simply plugging in a second satellite-navigation system.   \"You need something that is different and doesn't share common modes of failure,\" he told BBC News.

Some 3.5 million vehicles are being recalled to replace a spiral cable attached to the driver's side airbag.  It may be damaged when the steering wheel is turned and result in the airbag not being deployed in a crash. Other issues include problems with seat rails, steering columns, windscreen wipers and a glitch with the engine starters that poses a fire risk.  Toyota said it was not aware of any vehicle crashes, injuries or fatalities caused by these conditions. However, it said it had received two reports of fires in connection with the engine starter problem. The carmaker said that \"due to inefficiencies in the design of the starter motor relays, metallic particles might accumulate on the contacts within the relay\". It said that if the relays continued to be used, the particles could come off and enter the relay's circuitry and in the \"worst case, this could lead to the starter relays catching fire\". Approximately 20,000 vehicles involving six Toyota models and the Subaru Trezia are being recalled to replace both engine starter relays and the engine starter motor. Other recalls include: The latest recall, which affects 27 different models, is the fifth major one that the company has issued in recent months.  Recalls are not uncommon in the industry. General Motors has recalled millions of vehicles in recent weeks as well. And while it is an inconvenience, customers have also started to realise that it is something that is in their best interest. It is now seen as a way of the carmakers saying, \"We will try and get it right, but if sometimes we don't we will fix it for you.\" But in the case of Toyota, the latest recall comes as it has been trying to rebuild its reputation as a maker of reliable and high-quality vehicles - which was key to its success over the past decades.  These recalls are likely to make that task more difficult. It has recalled more than 25 million vehicles over two-and-half years. To put that in context, it has sold just over 21 million during the same period. In February, it called back 1.9 million of its top-selling Prius hybrid cars because of a software fault that might cause the vehicle to slow down suddenly. In the latter half of last year, it issued separate recalls affecting more than 2.2 million vehicles.  Overall, the company has recalled more than 25 million vehicles over the past two-and-a-half years. That is far more than the number it called back in 2009 and 2010 - widely seen as the worst years in terms of damage to its reputation. Toyota's sales had suffered in the aftermath of those recalls, which were prompted by problems with accelerator pedals becoming trapped under floor mats. The recalls had also triggered a criminal investigation against the carmaker in the US.  Earlier this year, the firm agreed a $1.2bn (\u00a3720m) settlement with US regulators after a four-year inquiry into its reporting of safety issues. Recalls are not uncommon in the industry. For example, General Motors is in the middle of recalling millions of vehicles as well.  However, there are concerns that Toyota's current troubles may hurt its efforts to rebuild its reputation, which was damaged by the 2010 recall fiasco. ",

Early backers will get the machine for just $199 and other backers can pledge as little as $299.  Dubbed Micro, it comes with easy-to-use software that allows users to search, drag and drop objects to print. Kickstarter is a crowd-funding website that has breathed life into a range of technology projects, including the virtual reality headset Oculus Rift, which was subsequently bought by Facebook for $2bn. At just 7.3in (18.5cm) square and weighing 1kg (2.2lbs), the device will be easy to move around. It can be used with Windows, Mac or Linux. It comes with software that allows users to search and browse objects online. Once they have picked something they would like to print they drag it into the printer and hit print. \"It's our goal to make the Micro accessible to everyday users,\"  The tagline on its Kickstarter page calls it \"the first truly consumer 3D printer\".

        "article": "Facebook has removed a page entitled \"Soldiers deserve to be raped and murdered\" - but not because of its subject matter. The page was created last year and had sparked objections from members of the armed forces and the public. The site initially left it in place, saying it did not breach its rules. However, Facebook removed the page shortly after being contacted by the BBC, saying a check had revealed the account holder's details to be fake. Critics of the company have said the case highlights concerns about its review policies. The page was created last July and had called on visitors to \"support the cause in weeding out and eliminating this worthless breed of cowardice\". Facebook's Community Standards state that it will remove content where it perceives there to be a \"genuine risk of physical harm\" and that members may not \"credibly threaten others, or organise acts of real-world violence\". However, a spokesman for the social network indicated that the threat had not been specific enough for its complaints team to act on. \"Sometimes there is content on Facebook that expresses angry and unpleasant ideas but doesn't directly target anyone,\" he said. \"In such cases the page may be left up.  However, we can compel people who post things like this to make their real names visible so they are publicly accountable for their views.   \"On investigating this particular page administrator, we found they were using a fake account and we removed it.\" Clearly this page was taken down because it was offensive\u201d He confirmed that the fact the creator's details were false was only flagged after the site was contacted by the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, who had asked about the matter after it had been raised by a member of the audience. Among those to have previously complained about the posting were visitors to another page on Facebook set up to support members of the Royal Marine commandos. Its administrator - who had previously served in the British Army - said that this was just one of several pages concerning the armed forces that they had complained about, and added that he believed Facebook needed to be more proactive about deleting such material despite concerns this might raise about free speech.  \"You've got to show respect for the men and women who have fought and died for others to hold their own opinions,\" Stef Proietti told the BBC. \"It creates hatred and causes anger.  \"I appreciate that a lot of these types of pages are set up by what you would call internet trolls looking to create a reaction. \"But, as we've seen in the past... it creates more tension, not just among the social network's community but it also spills out into real life.\" By contrast, La Quadrature du Net (Squaring the Net) - a Paris-based group that campaigns for internet users' rights - said it was concerned that a company with as much influence as Facebook should be left to make such decisions.   \"A judge may or may not have considered that this was a direct call to violence, and on that ground may or may not have asked Facebook to remove it - and this is how it should be,\" said the group's co-founder Jeremie Zimmermann.  \"[Instead] Facebook has become a sort of parallel justice with its own rules that we cannot fully understand. \"This is a major problem for whoever believes their speech is protected on Facebook.\" But one academic said it was no surprise that the company had acted the way it had. \"The principle of First Amendment freedom-of-speech rights is something that nobody wants to be seen to be violating in the US, particularly Silicon Valley-type companies for which it's buried very deeply into their ideology,\" said Dr Joss Wright, of the Oxford Internet Institute. \"Clearly this page was taken down because it was offensive, but it's very convenient for the firm to have an alternative justification - the use of fake credentials or, as we've seen in other examples, a violation of copyright. \"I think Facebook will stick to this kind of approach as long as it can. It doesn't want to be put in a position where it's expected it will police its content because that could then turn into a requirement that is forced upon it.\" ",

        "article": "When Simeon Penn, director of powerboat experience company Saber Powersports, needed a loan for a new boat, he didn't go to his bank. Instead, he got the money from Funding Circle, an online marketplace that allows individual savers to lend money directly to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Mr Penn's accountant suggested he try this alternative form of funding after the bank failed to respond to his loan request after three weeks. With Funding Circle, the \u00a325,000 that Saber needed was in the company account two weeks later and the application process was very simple, Mr Penn said. Even more unusually, he spoke to a \"real person\" who took an interest in his business. By contrast, the bank \"was making him jump through hoops\", he said. He was so impressed by the process that when he needed a further \u00a315,000 to replace an engine and to increase his company's marketing before the peak summer season, he went back to Funding Circle. \"It's definitely the future; it's where businesses are going to go,\" he said. This type of peer-to-peer funding (P2P) - also known as crowdfunding - turns financing on its head. Instead of asking a bank or a few individuals for large sums of money, a business can ask a large number of people for just a small amount each. The more people who come forward to lend, the lower the interest rate a company can secure. Samir Desai, Funding Circle's chief executive and co-founder, believes speed is the key advantage for SMEs, with businesses getting access to cash within two weeks rather than the three months it typically takes the banks to stump up. \"There is no doubt that technology is now in the middle of changing financial services for good,\" he says. Carol Sullivan, who runs Divorce Negotiator, a firm which aims to help separating couples divide their financial assets, borrowed \u00a315,000 over three years at a rate of 6% from Zopa, the UK's oldest P2P lender for SMEs.  She used the money to fund a TV advertising campaign and says: \"The application process was much simpler and quicker than it would have been with a bank.\"  Open-source data handling systems, such as Hadoop, MongoDB and Cassandra, which can process and structure vast amounts of data from a wide and growing range of sources, including social media, have helped alternative lenders assess borrowers' creditworthiness to a much higher degree of accuracy than before. And this data crunching ability is encouraging new, flexible forms of finance. For example, Kabbage, a fast-growing Atlanta-based company, offers working capital of up to \u00a325,000 to small online businesses selling through eBay and Amazon. It decides how much businesses can have by analysing their social network profiles and user feedback ratings, as much as their commercial transactions. After merchants have been approved for funding - a process Kabbage says can take as little as seven minutes - the cash is deposited in their PayPal accounts, enabling them to buy more inventory and respond quickly to consumer demand. Technology also underpins new \"equity crowdfunding\" platforms, whereby businesses give up a stake in their company in return for investors' cash. For example, Inform Direct, a start-up that aims to make it easier for businesses to deal with Companies House, raised \u00a3450,000 in just two weeks using SyndicateRoom. The platform, which is similar to Crowdcube and Seedrs, offers investment so long as the company seeking capital has secured backing from a lead investor first. And philanthropic funding platforms such as Kickstarter have helped many small businesses and artists bring their projects to fruition. P2P lending may be fast, but it isn't necessarily the cheapest way to raise business capital. Interest rates for the past 100 loans made via Funding Circle's platform ranged from 7.3% to 12.4%, the company says. This is higher than the 4.4% to 7.2% range charged by banks for fixed-rate loans to SMEs, according to the British Bankers Association (BBA). This may be one reason why the UK alternative finance market is still relatively tiny, albeit growing fast. In 2011, it provided \u00a326.7m of finance to SMEs. By last year, that figure had jumped to \u00a3332m, benefiting an estimated 5,000 SMEs, according to research from enterprise charity Nesta.  Poor service from banks is certainly helping this growth.  Last November, government adviser Lawrence Tomlinson issued a damning report on the banks' \"disturbing patterns of behaviour\" towards SMEs. He said many businesses were being \"actively deterred from accessing finance before being given the chance to apply\". But awareness of funding alternatives remains low. A recent survey from the Federation of Small Businesses found that just 37% of SMEs knew about them. And according to the BBA, the UK's main five banks still account for 60% - around \u00a3100bn - of all loans and overdraft borrowing by SMEs. The reliability of the underlying technology is increasing confidence in the sector, however. The UK government allocated \u00a320m in 2013 and a further \u00a340m this year to inject directly into small businesses via Funding Circle, and this month the Financial Conduct Authority began regulating the sector for the first time, giving it an official stamp of approval. And in this year's Budget, Chancellor George Osborne announced that P2P lending will be allowed within tax-free individual savings accounts for the first time. Giles Andrews, founder and chief executive of Zopa, is confident that his industry is poised for rapid expansion. \"At the moment we are all busy competing with banks. Eventually we will be competing with firms like us, which will be a nice problem to have,\" he says.  ",

Rory Cellan-Jones looks at ways to manage strong online passwords Computer users across the globe are being strongly urged to change all their online passwords because of the Heartbleed Bug. Memory expert Tony Buzan gives tips on how to remember new ones, which should be a long jumble of randomly generated letters and numbers.  is something many people avoid at all costs, because they fear they will forget the new password. However, you can make something memorable by simply using the power of association and location. In order to remember a string of online passwords, all you have to do is  , calling on your imagination throughout. The more you stimulate and use your imagination, the more connections you will be able to make, and the more you will be able to memorise.  Here are security expert Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey password tips  Hackers can find out a lot about you from social media  Hackers can precalculate the encrypted forms of whole dictionaries and easily reverse engineer your password.  try a word or phrase where characters are substituted - Myd0gha2B1g3ars! If hackers compromise one system, they won't be able to access other accounts. Don't write them down - use a secure password vault on your phone When you find that you have to remember a random formation of letters and numbers, devise your own   for each number and letter. Say for example, I need to remember this random mix of numbers and letters:   Start with a key image word that starts with the sound of each letter, and make sure the word is easy to imagine and easy to draw. For example,  If you can think of several possibilities for a letter, use the one that comes first in the dictionary.  A similar rule is applied to remembering   - you devise key memory images for words that rhyme with the sound of the words for the numbers. For example, the   word that most people use for the number   and the images conjured up for it range from one enormous hive, from which emanates a sky-covering swarm of monster bees, to a microscopic hive, with only one tiny bee.  To remember a random   you need to \"translate\" each number and letter of the password you have to remember into an image whether it be in a form of a letter or story, devised from a basic code. Use the letters and numbers you have transcribed and   and phrases that link you back to both the number and the letter.  ",

        "article": "The Bradley Timepiece, a watch designed for blind people and named after a Paralympian gold medallist who lost his sight in Afghanistan, is up for design of the year at London's Design Museum. But it's mostly being bought by sighted people, writes Chris Stokel-Walker. The watch has a stark, circular titanium face. There are no hands. There are no numbers. Around a groove in the centre a ball-bearing rotates to mark the minutes. Around the edge of the watch, another ball bearing rotates to tell the hours.  The Bradley was designed for the use of blind people, the latest in a long line of efforts to help those without sight efficiently tell the time. Designer Hyungsoo Kim was in a lecture hall at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in September 2011 when a neighbouring student asked him the time. \"My classmate is visually impaired, and had been for 10 years,\" explains Kim.  The student had a watch that could tell the time, but only by pressing a button that would make it speak out loud. Doing so in a classroom could be disruptive, so instead, says Kim, \"I was his wristwatch.\" There are a number of timepieces for the blind, including the   that uses a series of rumbles to denote hours and minutes. Tactile, or Braille watches, are popular in the blind and partially sighted community. They look similar to a normal watch, but the front glass can be flipped up, allowing the wearer to touch the hands and tell the time.  \"If you're blind you don't know if you've got up in the middle of the night,\" explains Leslie Duroe of RNIB, the UK's main charity for the blind and partially sighted. \"It can make people feel very insecure to not know what time it is.\" For Kim, previous designs were more functional than beautiful. Sighted people choose their watches as much as a fashion statement as for merely telling the time. Many might assume that blind people care only about function. But that's wrong. There were also practical criticisms over existing watches for some users - in the case of tactile or Braille watches, foreign objects such as food could clog or affect the progress of the hands.  Kim wanted a watch that looked good and would work for his friend.  \"I put together a team of engineers and we came up with the idea of a Braille display, one that would display the time written out in Braille,\" says Kim. But when a prototype was created, the feedback wasn't great. \"We learned that less than 10% of visually impaired people can read Braille,\" Kim says. What's more, many people in the UK and US are not born blind but develop sight problems later in their lives - 82% of those living with blindness are aged 50 or older, according to the World Health Organization. With less experience of reading Braille, their sense of touch is often less developed. Kim and his team went back to the drawing board - the timepiece went through 25 different versions, each one tested by visually impaired people.  There was always a battle between functionality and producing a beautiful object.  Damon Rose is blind, and produces the BBC's   - he describes the pros and cons of timepieces currently on sale for blind and partially-sighted people: \"Telling the time if you're blind is a question of 'tactile v talking'. A discreet feel of your Braille watch under the desk, allows you to know if a meeting is going on too long or if it's lunchtime. Unfortunately, touching the button on a talking watch, broadcasts the time to the whole room and rudely suggests, 'I want to be somewhere else.' And in the middle of the night can wake your partner unless you stifle it with a pillow.  \"Braille watches present other problems - you have to probe gently for fear of knocking the hands and altering the time. And if you want to check your watch during dinner, beware of getting food inside it. \"Manufacturers of accessible goods for blind people have discovered that producing something functional isn't enough - blind people always ask what it looks like, even though they can't see. In some ways, this suggests that it matters more if you're trying to control what people might think of you.\" Eventually, a design was agreed upon - a magnet underneath the metal watch face would control two rotating ball bearings for hours and minutes. But even the ball bearings were a matter of debate. \"People wanted the ball bearings to be bigger so they could feel it better,\" Kim says. \"But as designers, were concerned that making them bigger would make the watch clunky. We had to find the midpoint.\" In September 2011, the same month Hyungsoo Kim started work on his project, life changed for bomb disposal officer Lieutenant Bradley Snyder. He stood on an explosive device in Afghanistan, suffering serious injuries and losing his sight.  By August 2012, he had won two swimming gold medals at the London Paralympic games. But the practicalities of daily life were initially an immense struggle.  \"I was hurt in Afghanistan and the next thing I know I'm waking up in hospital in the United States. There was a 60 hour-long gap in my memory.\" Immediately Snyder, his sight lost, found getting his bearings difficult. \"You don't realise how much you use time to orient where you are. At the beginning it was very disorienting. And especially being in the military, time is all important.\" Eventually Snyder was approached by Kim, after a chance meeting with a mutual friend. \"Hyungsoo was making a product for blind people,\" says Snyder. \"I was his blind guy.\" \"I had a speaking watch for a little while,\" he begins. \"You pressed a button and it told you the time.\" Uncannily mimicking a robotic voice, Snyder says \"the time is 3:30pm\" and laughs. \"It was utilitarian. And if I'm on a train, I can't hear it. Fashionable brands have long dominated the sportswear market, but up to now few have specifically targeted disability sports. Nike has now become the first to produce a sole for a blade used by amputee runners. Has the era of Paralympic chic dawned? \"What's more, as soon as I hit that button it highlights me as someone with a special need. I love the idea of using the same thing that everyone does. And I want to feel as normal as possible.\" With the watch now named the Bradley, there was an appeal on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding website, in July last year - 3,681 people from 65 different countries backed the project, donating a total of $594,602 (\u00a3357,290). It will be available for sale from May in the US, with the UK and Europe likely to follow later. A further 1,000 people have since pre-ordered the watch online but only a tiny fraction of those - Kim estimates between 1-2% - are visually impaired.  \"It bridges the gap between the disabled and the non-disabled,\" says Snyder.  The watch is now among the favourites in the 76 nominations for the Designs of the Year contest at London's Design Museum. The nomination has already led to interest from European retailers. There's an obvious gimmick for selling to sighted people - you can check the time in a social or work setting without appearing rude. It's easy to imagine seeing the watch, with its titanium face and minimal style, on a wrist and not immediately guessing its genesis as an item for blind people.  \"The stereotype is that visually impaired people are not fashion-conscious,\" says Kim. \"I had that misconception too. But it's wrong.\" ",

        "article": "The US government recently announced that it would be handing off the reins of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), an organisation tasked with assigning and managing domain names and IP addresses worldwide.  While the transfer of power won't happen until September 2015 and has been planned since the organisation's creation in 1998, some reactions have been panicked, to put it lightly. This transfer of power could mean the end of a single united internet,   Keith Darnay for the Bismarck Tribune. Enjoy the internet while you can\u201d Darnay wonders what happens if September 2015 arrives and no organisation is ready to take control. Perhaps the US agrees to stay in a leadership position until the new digital overseers are in place, but other countries get nervous and start developing their own internets. \"Indeed, we may be living in the waning days of the Internet's 'Golden Age,'\" he writes, \"a time when we were tantalisingly close to being united in a single digital world.\" John C Dvorak   that the US giving up Icann will change the course of the internet forever. \"Enjoy the internet while you can,\" he writes for PC Magazine. \"America has waved the white flag. Decades from now, we will look back at the glory days fondly.\" He continues: The internet is a collective hallucination, one of the best humanity has ever generated\u201d Others predict that the internet will fall under the sway of governments they fear are uninterested in electronic freedom. \"It's been a good month for Vladimir Putin: He got Crimea and the internet,\"   L Gordon Crovitz of the Wall Street Journal. The US has used its level of control to make sure that access to the internet and content is free from political interference, he writes. If the US follows through with this plan, the alternative is a weak international body fending off governments who will try to use their influence to silence their critics. \"China could get its wish to remove FreeTibet.org from the internet as an affront to its sovereignty,\" Crovitz writes. \"Russia could force Twitter to remove posts by Ukrainian-Americans criticising Vladimir Putin.\" The editors of the Orange County Register   with the explanations behind the future transfer. Along with many commentators, they point to the Edward Snowden revelations about the National Security Agency as the reason behind the US's decision to hand over Icann, the idea being that perhaps the US can buy back some global trust. \"Trading away control in exchange for the ephemeral - or completely illusory - goodwill of foreign governments is unforgivably naive and can only damage the causes of free speech and freedom of information for everyone,\" they write.   Media requires JavaScript to play. Julian Assange speaks to the BBC's technology programme Julian Assange, the founder of the anti-secrecy website Wikileaks, counters that a division of the internet might not be such a bad thing. \"I think the impulse to do it is quite important and will lead to good things and should be supported,\" he  . \"The devil is in the details in terms of how these communications links actually operate.\" Mr Assange said that it would be difficult to build a European internet because of the number of backdoor deals conducted between Europe and the US. If those deals can't be stopped, than another organisation - presumably Assange's own Wikileaks - has to step up and publish what these governments are up to. \"For any organisation to be accountable, the buck has to stop with someone,\" he says. Others are suggesting that we all try to understand the role of Icann a little bit better. Today's Icann already works, and I can't think of a good reason to do away with it\u201d \"The internet is a collective hallucination, one of the best humanity has ever generated,\"   Jonathan Zittrain for New Republic. \"To be sure, it is delicate in many ways, with its unowned character threatened from many quarters. But rest easy that Icann isn't one of them.\" He says that it is almost impossible for Icann to get involved in a way that could prohibit free speech, as all it does is decide who runs each list of names. The US government has had little impact on how the organisation has run so far, he contends, and Icann cannot tax internet usage. If anyone tried to change that, there would be a powerful backlash. \"Anyone trying to tighten the screws too much will simply strip them,\" Zittrain writes. Icann chief Fadi Chehade has published a   attempting to correct some inaccuracies and misconceptions. He writes that giving up Icann is not the same as surrendering control of the internet. He adds that the move is not a response to Mr Snowden's information, would not lead to a division of the internet, and would not affect the general public. He believes critics are distracted by all of this misinformation and missing the larger point. \"Instead of politicising the debate over the US government's decision to transition stewardship of the internet's technical functions, let's move forward with the discussion we need to have - how to engage in the necessary discussion to develop an effective transition process, one that continues to ensure an open internet that belongs to everyone,\" he says. Hiawatha Bray of the Boston Globe   why this transition is necessary. Why fix something that isn't broken? He says he doesn't expect the handover to be a disaster, as the Obama administration has made clear that it intends to prevent any governments from taking control of the organisation. Ideally, Icann would be a truly independent agency with no motivation to censor or impose restrictions. \"Done right, it might work,\" he writes. \"But today's Icann already works, and I can't think of a good reason to do away with it.\"  Whatever happens, the editors of the Washington Post think that the US is in the end responsible. They   that the US commerce department has to ensure that the internet's new stewards are free from outside influences that would make it harder for them to do their important administrative work. \"The commerce department's contract with Icann expires next year,\" they note. \"If the non-profit hasn't organised itself to ensure the continued functioning of an open, free and functional Internet by then, US authorities should not let global politics stop them from extending their supervision.\" ",
