Current account holder Charlotte Brooks on why she switched banks More than 600,000 people have changed their current account provider in the first six months of a scheme designed to make switching banks easier. The 609,300 switches in the six months to the end of March marked an increase of 14% on the same period a year ago. Two thirds of customers are now aware of the service, according to the Payments Council, which oversees it.  But, with 46 million current account holders in the UK, switching levels remain relatively low. The Payments Council said the new, quicker service had taken the \"fear factor\" and \"barriers\" away from switching. Under the new rules current account holders should be able to move their bank account to another provider within seven days. It had taken up to 30 days to switch previously. The switching guarantee also means the new bank or building society has to arrange for the transfer of all existing incoming and outgoing payments to the new account. \"By making the Current Account Switch Service quick, hassle-free and removing the fear factor, we've taken away the barriers customers told us they had when it came to switching,\" said Gary Hocking, managing director of the Payments Council. Current accounts should also not be ignored when it comes to shopping around for the best rate\u201d \"There's also been a noticeable surge of advertising activity from current account providers, big and small, suggesting that the new service is helping foster competition and choice for customers.\" However, some have questioned the success of the new scheme. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: \"Despite an increase in public awareness and confidence, switching levels are still low, suggesting that the new seven-day service is not the game-changer that can significantly increase competition in banking.\" Tesco Bank and Virgin Money plan to launch current accounts this year, while existing providers have offered a range of incentives for customers to change or stick with their current bank, from interest on balances to one-off cash payments. Some current accounts now offer three times the interest rate of some instant access savings accounts, according to price comparison website Moneysupermarket. \"Current accounts should also not be ignored when it comes to shopping around for the best rate - especially as providers are also offering cash incentives to those who switch,\" said Kevin Mountford, head of banking at the website. \"However, people should be aware of high overdraft charges on some of these accounts. Those who regularly dip into their overdraft will find a better deal elsewhere.  \"In order to benefit from the higher rates, customers will need to meet the minimum funding requirements or other terms and conditions, so it is important to check these before you switch.\" ",

The losses, in line with expectations, come after the bank's failed bid to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Bank last year. The deal collapsed after the discovery of a \u00a31.5bn black hole in the Co-op Bank's balance sheet.  Parent company the Co-operative Group lost control of the bank to a group of US hedge funds that launched a rescue deal in December. The bank said it did not expect to make a profit in 2014 or 2015. It also apologised to its 4.7 million customers.    Media requires JavaScript to play. Co-op Bank chief executive Niall Booker said: \"We appreciate that customers and other stakeholders continue to feel angry about how past failings placed the future of the business so seriously at risk.  \"I would like to apologise to them, to thank them for their continued loyalty and to thank colleagues for their commitment during such difficult times.\" The bank said it would not pay out \u00a35m to former executives who left the bank after its near collapse last year. But Mr Booker will receive a \u00a32.9m pay package, which includes a basic salary of \u00a31.2m and up to \u00a31.7m in performance related bonuses.  Mr Booker could also receive a potential \u00a31.2m as part of a three year incentive plan based on the future performance of the business.  It said up to 40 of its high street branches will close this year, which is likely have an impact on jobs, although the bank has yet to put a figure on the number of posts under threat. The results were published after two earlier delays.  Beneath the news of the losses that were widely expected, those interested in the future of the Co-op Bank will focus on two things.  How is the bank progressing on its plans to raise a further \u00a3400m and is there any evidence of a decline in customer numbers? On the first, I am told negotiations are going well.  As yet, the Co-op Group - which owns 30% of the bank - has not agreed to inject more money and there will be a lot of interest in what it says about the issue when it publishes its own annual results next week. On the second there is mixed evidence.  The number of current account holders is up slightly while business customers - far more affected by the ratings downgrades suffered by the Co-op - has declined.  In March, Co-op Bank was forced to admit it had found another \u00a3400m black hole in its finances, forcing it to issue new shares in an attempt to raise the funds from investors.  The shortfall became apparent after the discovery of additional costs related to past misconduct and poor documentation. The biggest part of the additional costs relate to payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling and lapses in the provision of mortgages. The bank said it would pay \u00a3114m to compensate customers who had been overcharged on mortgage repayments,  It has also set aside \u00a3110m to cover breaches of the Consumer Credit Act and \u00a3103m to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI).  Small businesses that were mis-sold complex interest rate hedging products will collectively receive \u00a333m in compensation. The Co-op Bank's additional rights issue has also triggered speculation that the Co-op Group's remaining 30% stake could be diluted, because it would struggle to find additional funds to maintain its shareholding. In December, the bank was the subject of a dramatic \u00a31.5bn rescue deal in which its parent company, the Co-operative Group, lost control of the bank to a group of US hedge funds,  They took a 70% stake in the bank.  Chris Wheeler, a banking analyst at Mediobanca, told BBC the bank was in a \"parlous position\". He said: \"It needs \u00a3400m more capital, [it is] claiming it's going to be a rights issue, The Co-op Group has to put in \u00a3120m.    \"So, big capital gap to be filled, and if the Co-op is no longer a major shareholder, one asks the question as to really what is the future style of the bank, because it may no longer be part of the Co-op Group per se.\" He also questioned whether members of the Co-op Group would want to put more money into the bank, suggesting the group might chose to protect its other businesses, which include the supermarket chain Somerfield and the Co-operative funeral home business.  Lord McFall, a Labour Co-operative peer, told the BBC he thought the Co-op Group should still invest in the beleaguered bank.  \"If you break it you own it,\" he said, blaming bad management and a lack of leadership at the top of the group for the bank's misfortunes. \"Not only did they sell the crown jewels, but they vandalised them,\" he added. Mr Booker said he was confident the bank would raise the additional \u00a3400m it needed even if the Co-op Group chose not to put in any further cash. \"Shareholders are very, very supportive and I really, really think that we're going to get this through the gate,\" he added. The Co-op Group itself has been forced to delay the publication of its annual results, after the departure last month of its chief executive, Euan Sutherland. The group's losses are expected to be about \u00a32bn. Mr Sutherland left after it was revealed that in a Facebook post he had described the group as \"ungovernable\". Earlier in March, details of his basic salary of \u00a31.5m, including a retention bonus of another \u00a31.5m, were leaked to the press. On Wednesday, it emerged that former Labour City minister Lord Myners, who had been drafted in by the Co-op Group in December to lead a review of the business, had resigned his position on the board of directors. Lord Myners was appointed as an independent director by Co-op Group chair Ursula Lidbetter in December to undertake a full review of the entire business.  His initial findings showed the group's elected directors had overseen \"breathtakingly value-destructive\" decisions, among which were the Co-op's takeovers of Britannia building society and supermarket chain Somerfield. He also found its three-tier system of elected member representation - made up of area committees, regional boards and the group board - had \"consistently produced governors without the necessary qualifications and experience to provide effective board leadership\". Too many directors, he said, did not have any serious business experience and were therefore not qualified to keep senior managers in check. Instead, he recommended new group board directors should be appointed according to clear criteria of skills and experience. But some of the Co-op's most influential members are worried that the changes could damage the group's values. ",

Chancellor George Osborne's Budget included plans to increase flexibility. Now some people who have already taken a lump sum from their pension will be given extra time to decide what to do with their money. Meanwhile, providers will contact pension customers if recent decisions are affected by the new reforms. Under current rules, anyone who takes a tax-free lump sum from their pension has six months before they are required to make a decision about how to take the rest of the savings in their pension pot. Among the options is buying an annuity - an annual retirement income for the rest of their life. If this is not done, the lump sum is then taxed at 55%.  The chancellor has announced plans to give people with defined contribution pensions much more flexibility over how they can take the money. This will take full effect in April 2015. Now, the Treasury has said that anyone who had taken a lump sum and was in the six-month decision period on 27 March will be given 18 months to decide how to organise the rest of their pension instead. In addition, the City watchdog - the Financial Conduct Authority - has said that annuity providers should contact customers who have recently applied for an annuity with a pension pot of less than \u00a330,000 to inform them that this could now be taken as cash.

China's Shanghai Composite index fell only 0.6%, but Tencent, China's biggest internet company, saw shares falling by more than 4%.  Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 2.4% to 13,960 on Friday, the lowest close in six months.   Fast Retailing was the biggest market loser, with shares down nearly 8% after it warned of lower annual profit. Authorities in Japan are keeping watch on the market movements.   \"In regards to the recent stock movements, I understand that the weak financial results of several US companies, as well as the cooled-down investor sentiment, have driven the stock prices down.\" \"We'd like to keep our eyes on the market movements,\" said the country's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga.  On Thursday's session in the US, the Dow Jones fell by 1.6%, while the S&P 500 dropped by a little more than 2%, its biggest loss since 3 February. The Nasdaq index had its worst day since November 2011, falling more than 3% - or 130 points - to 4,054, following a sharp sell-off in biotech shares. All Nasdaq stocks except one posted a loss. The drop in the Nasdaq, where many technology-related companies are listed, spooked investors in Asia, as there had been concerns that stocks from the technology sector were overvalued.  Meanwhile, shares in eBay fell 3.2% after activist investor Carl Icahn dropped his proposal that the company should split off its PayPal payments unit. ",

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that \"even the most astute consumer could struggle to understand what they are paying for\" with an unarranged overdraft. An estimated \u00a38bn is owed to banks and building societies through overdrafts. A banking trade body said overdraft charges had plummeted. The FCA will investigate the market over the summer. The regulator studied overdrafts that come as part of a current account, as well as unarranged overdrafts, where banks and building societies allow customers to go beyond their overdraft limit. It found that many people were confused about the costs and that overdrafts were not providing good value. \"Just about everybody who banks can have access to some sort of overdraft facility - whether they have signed up for it or not,\" said Christopher Woolard, director of policy at the FCA.  If you are unhappy with how much you are being charged, we recommend you shop around\u201d \"The sheer size of this market is huge and with overdrafts bolted on to over 30 million UK current accounts, we want to make sure it is working well for consumers.\" The regulator said that people failed to switch banks on the basis of overdrafts, so there was little pressure on banks to ensure these products offered good value. It also said that it was too simplistic for banks to claim that overdrafts subsidise the fact that there is no specific charge to open a bank account. The British Bankers' Association, which represents the major banks, said that overdrafts were still a good option for many people. \"Millions of people find overdrafts are an easy way to borrow money, more flexible and convenient than taking out a loan,\" said Eric Leenders, the BBA's executive director in charge of retail.  \"Anyone who uses this type of borrowing receives details of how much they are charged in their accounts statements.\" Overdraft charges were the subject of a major court battle four years ago. Banks defeated the Office of Fair Trading's attempt to regulate bank charges following the long-running legal case, but many have since made changes to their charging structures. They also had to process millions of complaints about charges, with payments made to many thousands of customers. \"Overdraft charges have plummeted in recent years, with estimated savings of up to \u00a3928m for customers since 2008,\" Mr Leenders said. \"But if you are unhappy with how much you are being charged, we recommend you shop around for an account better suited to your needs.\" ",

The billionaire had been trying to gather support for the proposed split before the e-commerce giant's annual shareholder meeting in May. But Mr Icahn, who first made the call in January, said it had become clear that several major shareholders would not back the plan. However, he said he still believed in the merits of a PayPal spin-off. \"I continue to believe that eBay would benefit from the separation of PayPal at some point in the near future,\" he said in a statement. As part of the agreement reached on Thursday, Mr Icahn, who owns a 0.8% stake in the firm, has also withdrawn his proposal to add two of his own nominees to eBay's board. But in a concession to the investor, eBay said it would follow his recommendation of adding David Dorman, a founding partner of investment firm Centerview Capital Technology, as an independent director on its board.  In the weeks after eBay revealed Mr Icahn's proposal, the investor wrote several letters to fellow shareholders questioning the abilities of eBay chief executive, John Donahoe, and calling corporate governance at the company among the worst he had ever seen. \"We are very pleased to have reached this agreement with Mr Icahn...enabling our board and management team to focus our full attention on a goal every shareholder agrees on - growing PayPal and eBay, and delivering sustainable shareholder value,\" Mr Donahoe  . He and other board members, including eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, have repeatedly said eBay had been funding PayPal's growth, and that the two were better off together. eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5bn (\u00a3905m), and the payments company is now the Silicon Valley firm's fastest-growing business, with 143 million active users at the end of 2013, up 16% from a year earlier.

Harvey Ellingham, boss of Home Improvements Guarantee, said that pride often led to DIY disasters at this time of year. A survey, by the Nationwide Building Society, suggests that DIY projects cost an average of \u00a33,342. But one expert told BBC News that enthusiasts often overspent. Jo Behari, a former City worker who founded Home Jane, a team of handywomen and home improvement specialists, said that spring was a good time to look out for bargains. This time of year is the most popular for homeowners to start DIY projects. The Nationwide survey suggested that nearly half of those asked were planning a project and were willing to spend thousands of pounds. This average bill increased for the older generation, with those aged over 55 spending \u00a34,045. Richard Napier, director for savings and mortgages at the Nationwide, said there was an \"appetite\" for people to invest in their homes.  However, 7% of people aged 18 to 24 were willing to use a credit card to fund this work, with another 4% happy to turn to payday loans to finance it. Mr Ellingham, who has been in the building trade for 20 years, said that people risked a big bill by failing to do their homework. Overlooking an extension being built by professionals at a home in Sutton, west London, he said that people risked damage to their homes and their health if they did not plan DIY work sufficiently. \"If you are going to put a nail into a wall, you need to know what is behind that wall. If you are going to put a nail into the floor, you need to know whether there are pipes under there,\" he said. \"It is common sense, but some people believe they know what they are doing and go full-steam ahead.\" But mistakes are not just made by people who only work on their own homes. A survey by the TrustMark accredited trader scheme found that incompetent tradesmen have cost UK homeowners an estimated \u00a31.9bn over the last year. Ms Behari said that some DIY enthusiasts failed to learn the basics about their home and were too embarrassed to admit they had a problem. She also said that people did not need to spend as much as they did at this time of year. She suggested: \"Make sure you don't buy ridiculously expensive tools; I know it is easy to get carried away,\" she said. ",

He was addressing a concern that London's luxury new-build property market is becoming a repository for the wealth of the global super-rich. As such, many argue it is doing nothing to ease the city's acute housing crisis - especially if the new homes are left empty.    Figures compiled by the global real estate consultancy Knight Frank show that for the two years to June 2013, 69% of new-build buyers in the prime central London market were not British. Almost half, 49%, were not resident in the UK - thus raising the fear that homes have been bought purely as an investment and may be left empty.   In an earlier phase of the development of the Thames-side Battersea power station, half the apartments built in former power station's shell were sold outside the UK.      The chief executive of the Battersea Power Station Development Company, Rob Tincknell, is aware that empty properties create a perception problem.  \"If this place doesn't work and there's nobody living here, it just won't function properly,\" he says. \"It is essential we do what we can to make sure our homes are occupied, and we're doing everything possible\".  It is not contributing anything to the community because it is empty\u201d \"You can't stop investors buying, but even if they do they're going to rent these properties out because people will want to live here - they will be great investments.\" Walking beneath One St George Wharf, another luxury tower development along the river from the Battersea site, I meet a woman walking her dog.  \"There's no way normal Londoners can live here, no way,\" she says.    She agrees rich foreign buyers are squeezing out local people though she accepts it is \"not their intention - it is just they have the money and the wherewithal.\"    \"It's out of most people's range,\" says a man eating a sandwich as he enjoys the new riverside walkway.  \"Youngsters coming on the market don't have a chance.\"  Across London I meet Westminster councillor David Boothroyd outside one of London's most controversial new-build properties. One Hyde Park is a luxury development with, as the name implies, views of Hyde Park itself.  \"It is the most luxurious block of flats you could ever imagine in London and they sell for about \u00a370m each.\" The population of London is growing by about 100,000 each year - but we're only building about 18-20,000 new homes\u201d \"It turns out there's almost no one actually living here,\" he says. The flats themselves are mostly investment properties and it is easier for the owners to keep them empty than have the hassle of renting them out, he says.   \"It is not contributing anything to the community because it is empty.\" He surveyed his central London borough, Westminster, and found that even though the number of homes had increased, the number of voters and council tax payers had fallen because so many properties were unoccupied.  However, Grainne Gilmore, head of residential research at estate agents Knight Frank, argues that those who leave properties empty are few and far between. \"It is a very small slice of the market. As you move up the value chain you have billionaires - globally wealthy people - who own homes all around the world and they spend a fraction of their time in each.  \"They are different from the investors, they want to keep their homes for their use only, but it really is at the top end of the market and it is a small fragment of homes in the capital.\" Despite anecdotal evidence of foreign buyers stoking house price inflation by purchasing normal residential properties, research by Knight Frank suggests that away from the prime central London locations, foreign non-resident buyers - at least of new-build homes - are less active.   Source: Knight Frank More than 79% of all new homes, even in inner London, are bought by UK residents and in outer London the figure is more than 93%, according to Knight Frank.  \"We do not have enough supply of homes in the capital and that has driven up pricing. Houses are not being built full stop,\" says Grainne Gilmore.  Much of the building that is taking place is aimed at the top end of the market. According to the property consultancy EC Harri, the next decade will see 20,000 prime residential units completed in London, with a sales value of \u00a350bn.     Prof Tony Travers, who is local government expert at the London School of Economics, agrees and says that London's rapid house price inflation is more to do with the lack of building than with foreign buyers.   \"The population of London is growing by about 100,000 each year, but we're only building about 18-20,000 new homes.\"  Back at Battersea Power Station the modest plans for affordable homes, just 15% of the total, have drawn stiff criticism. And only half of those are expected to be social housing, accepts Rob Tincknell.   So the homes ordinary Londoners can afford are simply not being built.    Battersea Power Station stopped generating electricity in 1983 and since then differing development proposals have come and gone - but this one, backed by Malaysian money, looks likely to succeed.   A much-loved building will have been given a new lease of life, yet most of the 3,444 new homes will be beyond ordinary Londoners' reach.  For most, London will have gained another neighbourhood to look at rather than live in.     ",
