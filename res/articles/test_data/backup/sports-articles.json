Onuoha kept the ball in play before latching on to a Carroll pass and angling in a shot.\n     Morrison and Zamora scored in injury-time to wrap up the three points.\n      \n     \"We're delighted to have got the win we needed, that hopefully goes a long way to securing our play-off spot.\n     \"It will be good to go into the play-offs with a bit of momentum.

I couldn't be happier with him.\"\n     The winner runs in the same Prince Khalid Abdullah colours as the legendary Frankel, who also won the Greenham before a stunning victory in Newmarket's 2,000 Guineas, one of 14 wins in an unbeaten career. \n ",

Realistically they will not make the top four so they must now wait until September 2015, at the earliest, before they are back in a competition that has become part of the furniture at Old Trafford. \n \r\n\t\t Manchester United are by far the most profitable football club in the world \r\n\t     It has been 19 years since United were last on the outside looking in. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers took the one English place. \n     Manchester United is a club that knows all about comebacks and about overcoming adversity, but there is much for David Moyes and his board to ponder as they prepare for a summer of rebuilding.\n     There is a belief within United's corridors of power that life without the Champions League will be a one-off. Liverpool thought the same when they dropped out in 2009-10, after five consecutive seasons. Four years on, they are only just on the brink of a return having finished seventh last season. \n     United finished 38 points ahead of Liverpool last season, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     - a swing of 55 points in 11 months. United will hope it is not a sign of things to come.\n     The plan of United's executive vice-chairman Edward Woodward and owners the Glazer family remains for Moyes to oversee an overhaul of the playing squad this summer. His transfer budget will be significant. \n     Key targets include Borussia Dortmund forward Marco Reus, and midfielders Toni Kroos from Bayern and Atletico Madrid's Koke. But will those players be prepared to sacrifice Champions League football to join United? \n     Many say not. \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     Each of their 'superstar' targets have been sounded out and United have been given encouragement. The problem may come if clubs with Champions League qualification join the bidding and are willing to match the financial packages on offer at Old Trafford. \n Can United persuade the likes of Bayern's Kroos to live without Champions League football next season?\r\n       The Southampton pair of Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana are targets for Moyes. Both will be offered the chance to join the start of a new era at United. That is how United are selling themselves. But that is only half the battle. \n     When Manchester City were trying to break into the top four, they were forced to outbid their rivals and offer more in wages than the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and United themselves. City blew Chelsea out of the water to sign Robinho, offering the Brazilian \u00a3160,000 a week. \n     They paid \u00a390,000 per week to Wayne Bridge and, a few weeks after finishing fifth in the Premier League, \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     to leave Barcelona. But then City were viewed as a club that was going places. Can United say the same?\n     Football agent Barry Silkman said: \"Manchester United is an incredible club, but things do change in football and I believe they will struggle to attract the very highest calibre of player. The only way to do it, is to pay big money. \n     \"It worked for Manchester City to a degree but they have paid massive salaries, and transfer fees that have been way over the top. They had no option, but United have to think of Financial Fair Play. They'll do well to finish in the top four next season.\"\n     There is also, of course, the question of keeping their very best players. \n     United are a financial superpower in football terms. They have pushed boundaries in the commercial world and boast no fewer than 35 individual sponsors, including an official noodle partner for Asia, Oceania and the Middle East, as well as 11 telecommunications partners around the world. \n Financially United are able to cope with a one-season absence from the Champions League, say experts\r\n       \"Manchester United are unique,\" said Christian Purslow, the former Liverpool managing director. \"They are by far the most profitable football club in the world. Their total profits this year, a difficult year, are still expected to be some \u00a3130m. Nobody is in a better position financially to withstand being out of the Champions League for a season. \n     \"I don't think sponsors would want to see United out of the Champions League for a long time. I don't think those sponsors will want to live with it for beyond a year and I expect United have not the slightest intention of allowing that to happen. Which is why I expect them to be incredibly active in this summer's transfer market.\"\n     United have been in talks with Nike for the past 12 months about renewing their record \u00a324m-a-year kit deal. United have not been prepared to countenance allowing Nike to get a cut-price deal, and nor do Nike expect to negotiate one.\n     In recent weeks, officials from Nike have been in meetings with United and have passed officials from Adidas on their way in as the Old Trafford club search out the best deal. The message is clear, that United remain in demand. \n     The timing of their world record \u00a353m per season \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     could not have been better when it was agreed 12 months ago. It will be unaffected by the club's absence from the Champions League when it begins next season. \n     Nor will United's eight-year contract with Aon, which is worth at least \u00a3180m to sponsor the club's training ground and training kit. The numbers are astonishing. \n     The impact on sponsors may take time to pinch, but a more immediate concern will be the loss of Champions League prize money, TV revenue and gate receipts. \n     Last season, United made \u00a331.3m from Champions League broadcasting money. Prize money came on top of that. Uefa pays around \u00a3800,000 for each Champions League win, a draw earns you \u00a3415,000. Prize money can be substantial - Chelsea took home \u00a348m from Uefa when they won in 2012. \n     Dan Jones, a partner in Deloitte's sports business group, said: \"There is certainly no need for United to panic. They are still signing up sponsors and I'd suggest that most of their major deals are not dependent on them being in the Champions League. \n     \"That means the only real loss they will feel comes from Champions League TV revenue, prize money and perhaps the lost gate receipts from home matches they might have staged. Some of that may be mitigated by Europa League qualification and, possibly, built-in savings in player contracts. All that adds up to around \u00a340-50m - only about 10% of their expected total revenue.\" \n     Senior figures at United would like to qualify for the Europa League, despite the logistical difficulties. Were United to win the Europa League in 2014-15, they would earn \u00a310m from Uefa.\n     That is a question no-one can answer with certainty. United officials will tell you one season and one season only. Those at Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and even Everton may also go into the new season with that in mind. \n     And with a new bumper Champions League deal to come in within the next 12 months, the prize has never been greater. \"For many years, it was a formality that the big four [United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool] would be in the Champions League,\" Purslow added.\n     \"That made running these clubs, in terms of their expected income and their wage spending, relatively simple. But the emergence of Manchester City changed the Premier League forever. \n Sir Alex Ferguson took United into the Champions League 19 years in a row and won it twice \r\n       \"Five massive clubs going for four Champions League places doesn't go. That is causing intense competition both on the field and off the field in the commercial marketplace, and that will only intensify. \n     \"Missing out on the Champions League this year represents \u00a330m in missed TV revenue for United - in 12 months' time, when the new Champions League TV deal kicks in, the cost of missing out will double. None of those five want to be on the wrong side of that.\"\n     Sir Alex Ferguson built the United empire as the game of football became a global business. That financial might will shelter Moyes for one season without Champions League football. United officials may not look so kindly on a second season without that prize.\n ",

        "article": "    As Liverpool prepares to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough, manager Brendan Rodgers is using \"the 96 in the sky\" as inspiration to deliver the honour Anfield treasures most.\n     Liverpool's last league title came in 1990, a year after Hillsborough - and those who died at the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest will be remembered at an emotional Anfield when the club meet Manchester City on Sunday.\n     The game, a possible title decider, will have \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     with a 13:37 BST kick-off, seven minutes later than usual to recall the period when Liverpool's game with Forest was stopped because of events unfolding on the Leppings Lane terrace at the home of Sheffield Wednesday.\n \r\n\t\t One lad looked me in the eye and said: 'Al, there are people dying in there' \r\n\t     \r\n  \r\n\n     as the Hillsborough families hope for closure after 25 years and Liverpool will be hoping to offer further footballing comfort by finally returning to the top of the domestic game.\n     Former Reds captain Alan Hansen, who was part of Liverpool's side that day, tells BBC Sport: \"It would be a tremendous thing for Liverpool to win the title on the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough and 24 years after they last won it, but every family will be different.\n     \"Justice and closure is the most important thing for the families and I feel 100% compassion for them. Liverpool winning the league would come a long way second or third in that process, although of course as fans they would love to see the club enjoy such success.\n     \"It would be great for Liverpool, Liverpool supporters and the Hillsborough families for Liverpool to win the title but that would not be the most important thing for them.\"\n     Hansen was playing his first game of the season at Hillsborough because of injury, and the memories of the day and the aftermath are still raw and recalled with emotion.\n     \"Whenever Hillsborough is brought up at any time, whether people talk about it, it is on the news or about how the fight of the families goes on, right away you start reflecting,\" says Hansen.\n A Liverpool fan pays his respects to the 96 supporters who died at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989\r\n       \"The day itself will never leave you. Then there was the aftermath as well, going to the hospital in Sheffield on the Monday. The first person that came to us was a mother with a 14-year-old son. The life support machine was going to be cut off and she wanted us to see the boy before they cut it off.\n     \"It was a million times worse and more for the mother but nobody prepares you for that. You're talking to a boy - and my son Adam was eight at the time and my daughter Lucy was five - that when you leave they are going to cut off the life support machine. I can hardly describe it.\n     \"The days after Hillsborough provided the whole range of emotions, when you are just crying your eyes out. You'd go up to Anfield talking to the bereaved and no-one knew what had happened. I'll never forget it until the day I die.\n     \"We were like counsellors. We didn't have any training and half the time families would talk to us and we were the ones who were crying.\"\n     Liverpool eventually returned to action and, despite losing out on the league title after Michael Thomas's last-minute goal for Arsenal, went on to win the FA Cup with victory over Everton.\n     However, Hansen adds: \"If I'd lost somebody, would I have wanted Liverpool to keep going in the FA Cup? The answer was probably not, but there were a lot of families that wanted it. When you go on the pitch you are thinking about nothing other than the game - it is totally bizarre in many ways. \n     \"It was sadness beyond belief and there were times when we were crying our eyes out and yet as soon as we got back on the pitch we were still going for the title and were 100% immersed in the football. There was almost a guilt thing at times. You are filled with sadness, then you are going out and playing.\"\n     Hansen's part in that semi-final was a reluctant one after fighting to regain full fitness following a serious knee injury.\n     He admits: \"I didn't want to play. I injured my knee in Spain in pre-season, had only played one reserve game on the Tuesday night and had only been back in training three weeks. \n     \"There was a virus which Barry Venison got and somebody else got and [manager] Kenny [Dalglish] told me I had to play. I told him I couldn't. I was 33 at the time and to go in straightaway might have been OK for someone who was 23 - but I was in.\n     \"I was totally immersed in the game and blind to anything. Two guys came on the pitch and I was the first there. I thought it was an invasion and told them they'd better get off or we'd be in trouble. I was maybe a bit off with them, then one lad looked me in the eye and said, 'Al, there are people dying in there.'\n     \"Even then I was thinking 'surely not' but then we came off and the whole reality hit us.\"\n     There was a footballing context for Liverpool as Dalglish, who emerged as the symbol of the club during the months following Hillsborough, succumbed to the strain and resigned in February 1991 with the club reigning champions.\n     Although Liverpool have not won a title since then, Hansen does not regard Dalglish's departure as the catalyst for those barren years.\n     He says: \"Without a shadow of a doubt it took its toll on Kenny. He did so much - setting up things for the families, with his wife Marina taking calls from relatives.\n     \"But it was an ageing team and the hardest thing for any manager to do is to break a team up, as Manchester United have found. I wouldn't say Hillsborough or Kenny going was the catalyst for any decline. \n Liverpool's last league title was in 1990 - the season after the Hillsborough disaster\r\n       \"The hardest part of any successful unit is to break it up and start again. Liverpool had done it about five times and sooner or later there is the chance you will not get it quite right.\"\n     Hansen believes Liverpool have a great opportunity to put that right this season, saying: \"All the way through the golden era the league title was the most important and always will be. Out of all the four tournaments, when they used to be big, the league was always the one we wanted.\n     \"Liverpool haven't won it for 24 years. It could be the start of a new era - and it is that important because next season Manchester United won't be as bad again and Manchester City and Chelsea will spend big.\n     \"Will Luis Suarez ever have another season like he has just had? If Liverpool win the league the supporters will regard it as being back where they belong.\n The Premier League table as it stands\r\n       \"Anfield will be very emotional on Sunday. The atmosphere will be phenomenal and Manchester City are a very good side but every time Liverpool have been asked the question they've answered.\"\n     And if manager Rodgers does emulate Dalglish, the victims of Hillsborough and their families will be in his thoughts.\n     \"We can't say too much about Hillsborough because the inquests are under way,\" says Rodgers. \"But as a manager coming into the football club I know there are 96 people in the sky who will always be supporting this football team.\n     \"If we are to achieve anything this year, they will always be in our thoughts - the 96 in the sky and the families that go with them.\"\n ",

Raikkonen has scored seven points and is 12th overall.\n     In the constructors' championship, Ferrari are fifth, 78 points behind leaders Mercedes, who have dominated the start of the season.\n     The car that Alonso was using in the latest test was raced by Raikkonen in Bahrain last weekend.\n     Ferrari believe it was damaged when Raikkonen collided with the kerb on the exit of Turn Four during first practice on Friday.\n \r\n\t\t We are not stupid people, we have good things going on \r\n\t     \"This damage became only apparent this morning and we stopped running on a precautionary basis in order to fix the chassis,\" said a spokesman.\n     Despite the disappointing start to the campaign, both Alonso and Raikkonen insisted after the race in Bahrain they had confidence that Ferrari could improve.\n     \"We have the resources, we have the potential, everything in our hands,\" said Alonso. \"We believe we can do better than we are doing now.\"\n     Raikkonen added: \"We have some new parts coming and hopefully we improve. We know what we have to do.\n     \"The people are pushing 100%, but it takes time. We are not stupid people, we have good things going on.\" \n ",

        "article": "    Rory McIlroy feels he battled a \"very difficult\" course set-up as he opened his Masters with a one-under 71 to sit three shots behind \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     The Northern Irishman, 24, bidding to win a third major, missed a four-foot putt on the last to stay at two under.\n     \"When I saw the pin positions I thought they didn't want people to get too many under par,\" said the world number nine. \n     \"The greens are drying out quickly, anything under par is good. By Sunday they are going to be pretty dicey.\"\n     McIlroy, who claimed the \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     and the \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     carded four birdies and three bogeys during his round.\n     Early momentum with two birdies inside five holes was checked with a dropped shot on eight and three putts on the par three 12th saw him lose another stroke.\n     He focused on claiming birdies on the back nine's two par five holes and admitted he would have been \"really happy\" with his day had he avoided the dropped shot at the last.\n     \"The greens are firming up, the wind was all over the place, it was a good day at the office,\" added McIlroy, who forms part of the final group to play on Friday, with a tee time of 18:59 BST.\n     \"If conditions stay the same and they put the pin positions in tough spots, it will be tough to get your ball close, so anything even par, one under, two under is a good score.\n     \"I'm feeling good with my game and came in here relaxed to try and enjoy the week. If I can do that and not get ahead of myself then hopefully I'll give myself a great chance.\"\n     Holes two and 13, both par fives, played the easiest on the course, with 81 of the day's 250 birdies being claimed on the pair.\n     England's \n     \n    a top-15 finisher in each of the last four years, said he \"didn't make enough\" of the opportunities the par fives presented after carding a one-over 73.\n     \"That's where you're scoring on this golf course,\" said Westwood, who was in the day's final group.\n     \"It was a bad draw being out last. You sort of sigh when you see the draw. That's as hard as it will play all day. I will be out a bit earlier on Friday and hopefully it's more scoreable.\"\n Lee Westwood failed to record a birdie on any of Augusta National's par fives on day one of the the Masters\r\n       On a day where 19 of the 97-strong field finished under par, England's \n     \n     winner of the 2013 US Open, finished on four over.\n     Compatriot \n     \n    finished seven over par having suffered a quadruple bogey on the ninth, where he received a two-shot penalty for grounding his club in the bunker. \n     \"Left my bunker shot in the bunker and touched the sand before my next shot,\" tweeted Donald, who is yet to win a major. \"A pretty dumb mistake.\n     \"I can accept the odd poor shot but making a mistake like that is pretty frustrating and so unlike me. Nothing I can do about it now, brush it off and try and make a bunch of birdies tomorrow.\"\n     Meanwhile, England's 19-year-old amateur \n     \n     gave himself \"six or seven\" out of 10 after shooting a four-over 76 on his Masters debut.\n     Matthew Fitzpatrick took five fewer putts than McIlroy on day one but only found eight of 18 greens in regulation and consequently finished five shots worse off.\n     The Sheffield-born player, who qualified as 2013 US amateur champion, was playing with defending champion Adam Scott and said the Australian, who is tied for second with Louis Oosthuizen and Bubba Watson on three under, seemed to have the ball \"on a piece of string\".\n     If Fitzpatrick - a Sheffield United fan - makes the cut on Friday, he may well be in action while his team play in the FA Cup semi-final against Hull City on Sunday.\n     \"If you would have said to me last year my soccer team would get to the semi-final of the FA Cup and I'd play at Augusta, I'd just never, ever believe you in a million years,\" he said.\n     Scotland's \n     \n     also a Masters debutant, reached three under at the turn to feature prominently on the leaderboard, but three bogeys in successive holes saw him drop away - eventually finishing on one under.\n     \"I was happy to get under par and stay in the red,\" said the 39-year-old. \"I played with Sandy Lyle, Jose Olazabal and Miguel Angel Jimenez in practice.

        "article": "    Andy Murray will begin the search for a coach to replace Ivan Lendl on Wednesday and hopes to have someone in place by next month's French Open.\n     The Briton, whose \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     says he does not want to \"rush [the process] and make a mistake\".\n     Murray, 26, next plans to play at the Madrid Masters, which begins on 5 May.\n     \"The plan is to think exactly what I need over the next week, two weeks,\" Murray told BBC Sport.\n     \"Murray has clearly been turning over a few options in his mind, but names won't be jotted down on any shortlist until Thursday at the earliest. It would be ideal if he could appoint a new coach before Roland Garros, as Wimbledon follows hard on its heels, but finding the right person is not an exact science and it may well take longer. Murray is planning on doing more thinking than playing over the next week, before heading to Valencia to begin his preparations for the Madrid Masters.\"\n     \"There's a lot of factors you need to look at and I would hope I would have someone in place by the French Open, but I don't want to rush it.\n     \"I don't want to get someone just because they've won a lot of tournaments or were great players.\"\n     Murray and Lendl enjoyed a hugely successful two-year period together in which the Scot won Olympic gold followed by the US Open and Wimbledon titles.\n     Since having back surgery last September, Murray has slipped to eighth in the world rankings, and he will need to perform well over the clay-court season if he is to get back near the top four - and the higher seeding that brings - by the time he defends his Wimbledon title in June.\n     \"[A new coach] needs to be the right fit for you and they need to get on well with your team too, because otherwise it's very hard to make it work,\" said Murray, who was speaking \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     where his friend \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     \"It's going to be an exciting few weeks because getting a new coach can make big differences, as you saw with Ivan.\n  Media requires JavaScript to play. Andy Murray loses to Fabio Fognini at Davis Cup     \"Since I've finished with Ivan, I've played a tournament in Miami and then went pretty much straight to Davis Cup, and I haven't really sat down and thought about what I think my future holds.\n     \"So that's what I need to do over the next couple of weeks and then hopefully find the right person.\"\n     Murray was part of the Great Britain Davis Cup team that \n    \r\n  \r\n\n     in the quarter-finals last weekend, and he admitted winning the tournament had always been an unlikely prospect.\n     It was the first time Britain had reached the last eight since 1986 and, had they beaten Italy, their semi-final opponents would have been a Swiss team led by Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka. \n     \"Tim [Henman] and Greg [Rusedski] were both in the top 10 at one time, I think, and they didn't manage to win a match in the World Group and they were a great doubles team as well,\" said Murray.\n     \"That shows how difficult it is to win at that level, even when you have top singles players, so to expect to win the competition for us would have been unrealistic.\n     \"But this last three, four years, has been an incredible run when you think where we started from.\"\n ",
