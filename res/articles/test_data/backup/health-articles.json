The survey, carried out by UK male cancer charity Orchid, questioned 3,000 men aged 15 to 45. It also found that 50% of those surveyed would shy away from showing their GP if they discovered a lump. Figures from the NHS show that testicular cancer is the most common form of the disease in men aged between 15 to 45.  Each year around 2,300 men in that age group are diagnosed with the illness.  According to Orchid, the success rate for curing testicular cancer is high. Rebecca Porta, chief executive of the charity, said: \"If caught early, testicular cancer can be 98% curable. \"Sadly our findings indicate that men who delay seeking an early diagnosis may risk the disease spreading and a poor response to the treatment.\" Griff Jones, 29, from Liverpool was diagnosed with testicular cancer four years ago.  He said he thinks if he had gone to the see his GP earlier he would have avoided the cancer spreading to his stomach and back.  Griff received emergency chemotherapy in time to stop it spreading to his heart.  \"There wasn't really an embarrassment, it's just that there wasn't really a lump, which is what you get told all the time to look out for,\" Griff said.  \"Mine was a swelling, then a couple of days later it would go back to normal and I would feel fine.  \"Then a couple of weeks later it would swell again with a bit of pain. I put it down to playing football, a slide tackle, or something like that,\" he added. This latest research was conducted specifically for Cancer Awareness Week, which runs from 7 April to 13 April. It found only 21% of men surveyed across the UK perform regular self-checks, with 50% admitting they would shy away from immediately showing their GP if they discovered a lump. Unmarried men were less likely to know what to do, with 69% are unaware of how to correctly check themselves. Data from 2009 suggested that 73% of men recognised a lump in their testicles as a sign of testicular cancer and in 2014 this has increased by 14% to 87%.  Orchid suggest this shows that awareness of the symptoms of the disease has increased but that men still are still not taking proactive steps to protect themselves.  Griff didn't think testicular cancer would happen to him.  \"I was a pretty fit, I was playing football for Barnsley and had then moved to another semi-professional team. That's when I got myself checked,\" he said \"I now get a few people asking me to have a look at them, saying 'Griff I've got a bit of a lump or something', but I tell them to just go to the doctor.\"  Follow   on Twitter ",

        "article": "The NHS in England is continuing to perform marginally better than the other UK nations, but the gap is narrowing, a review suggests. The joint Health Foundation and Nuffield Trust study looked at a range of factors from waiting times to death rates. It found overall all four nations were improving - mainly because of extra money and targets. But it found some evidence the rate of improvement was faster outside England. It comes after a   by the Nuffield Trust in 2010 suggested England was out-performing the rest of the UK. Researchers analysed data going back up to 20 years on some measures. MRSA death rates have fallen fastest in Northern Ireland in recent years, but they are still nearly three times higher than they are in England. For ambulance response rates, performance is measured in terms of answering life-threatening calls within eight minutes. In England performance has been hovering around the 75% mark for the past five years. Whereas for the rest of the UK it has risen from just over 55% for the other nations in 2006-2007 to 73% for Scotland and Northern Ireland and 68% for Wales. Wales is also lagging behind on waiting times for non-emergency operations following a deterioration in performance since 2009-2010.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Health Foundation chief executive Dr Jennifer Dixon: ''Overall the health system seems to be improving'' The report found waiting times for hip replacements were 170 days on average in Wales compared with 77 in England. It said the most obvious reason for this was the cut in funding seen over the previous three years in Wales of 1% compared with the growth elsewhere. Researchers said this should act as a warning to politicians as they consider how to manage government spending during times of austerity. In terms of avoidable deaths rates - which is considered a good proxy for healthcare performance - the figures have been improving across the UK. Rates more than halved in each country from 1990 to 2010. Again England has the best figures, but the biggest gains have been seen in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Researchers said the fact all four nations were seeing improvements indicated that the different policies pursued since devolution, such as competition in England and collaboration in Scotland and Wales, had made little difference. Instead, they said the most important steps appeared to be funding - as the biggest increases have been seen in the past decade when the budgets have risen the most - and the use of a few key targets. Health Foundation chief executive Dr Jennifer Dixon says: \"It is very good news for the public that the quality of healthcare is improving across the UK. \"But what is also humbling for politicians is that so far no one policy cocktail seems to be more effective than another on NHS performance.\" The report was welcomed by ministers from all four countries. Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil said it showed \"significant improvements\" had been made, particularly on waiting times. Meanwhile, Welsh Health Minister Mark Drakeford said steps were being taken to improve waiting times, but there were other measures, such as ambulance response times, where really good progress had been highlighted. Northern Ireland's Health Minister Edwin Poots added his priority was to \"step up\" the improvements that were being seen. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the report reaffirmed the importance of protecting the NHS budget - a key Tory pledge during the last election campaign. ",

        "article": "A new treatment for hepatitis C \"cured\" 90% of patients with the infection in 12 weeks, scientists said.  The study is a \"major breakthrough\" and marks a \"turning point\" in hepatitis C treatment, said experts. More than 200,000 people are infected with hepatitis in the UK, and deaths from the infection have increased threefold since 1996. Only 3% of patients in the UK currently opt for the existing treatment, which only works half of the time.  We suddenly have the opportunity to eliminate the virus in the UK - even without a vaccine\u201d Hepatitis C is a  .  It is passed on by the blood, or bodily fluids of an infected person, and can be transferred through tattoo needles, or people taking drugs and sharing needles.  Researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Centre tested the new oral drug in 380 patients at 78 centres in Spain, Germany, England and the US in 2013.  Two studies were carried out, one in patients for 12 weeks, and another, for 24 weeks.  The patients had liver cirrhosis, indicating an advanced form of the virus. After 12 weeks, 191 of 208 patients no longer had hepatitis C, which increased to 165 of 172 patients, or 96%, after 24 weeks. Lead researcher, Dr Fred Poordad said: \"It is fantastic. I am so excited for the patients. There is finally hope for their future.\"  He said the drug worked by targeting the protein that makes hepatitis C and stopping it from replicating. \"Eventually the virus is extinguished,\" he said.  It remains to evidence the benefit of the treatment in patients with advanced liver disease\u201d The study worked for patients with genotype 1 infections, which account for 45% of infections in the UK. The other 45% are a genotype 3. Genotype 2 is less common.  The side affects were fatigue, headaches and nausea. Current treatment for hepatitis C can include a year's worth of injections and involve side-effects such as depression, tiredness and feeling sick. It also is not safe for many people with cirrhosis, said Dr Poordad.  Gkikas Magiorkinis, consultant physician in medical virology at the University of Oxford, said treating the patients with cirrhosis was a \"major breakthrough\".  Concerns over the high toxicity and low efficiency of current treatment had meant it was not widely been applied.  \"It remains to evidence the benefit of the treatment in patients with advanced liver disease,\" Mr Magiorkinis said. However the study did not show if the probability of cancer dropped in the long term, if cirrhosis was reversed or progression to total liver failure slowed.  Whether or not the treatment prevented further transmission in the public was also yet to be seen, he added.  Charles Gore, chief executive at the Hepatitis C Trust, said: \"This is a turning point. I think it is incredibly exciting. We suddenly have the opportunity to eliminate the virus in the UK - even without a vaccine.\" Mr Gore said whether or not the disease could be eliminated would be down to political will, which he said was lacking in the UK.  He said although the study involved genotype 1, treatments for genotypes 2 and 3 were \"close behind\", he said.  Mr Gore said treatment could reach the UK later this year.  ",

        "article": " Media requires JavaScript to play. Professor Carl Heneghan said side effects included serious \"psychiatric adverse events, renal adverse events and metabolic adverse events\" Hundreds of millions of pounds may have been wasted on a drug for flu that works no better than paracetamol, a landmark analysis has said.  The UK has spent \u00a3473m on Tamiflu, which is stockpiled by governments globally to prepare for flu pandemics.   claimed the drug did not prevent the spread of flu or reduce dangerous complications, and only slightly helped symptoms. The manufacturers Roche and other experts say the analysis is flawed.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Barry Clinch from Roche said Tamiflu had been approved by 100 regulators around the world The antiviral drug Tamiflu was stockpiled from 2006 in the UK when some agencies were predicting that a pandemic of bird flu could kill up to 750,000 people in Britain. Similar decisions were made in other countries.  The drug was widely prescribed during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Drug companies do not publish all their research data. This report is the result of a colossal fight for the previously hidden data into the effectiveness and side-effects of Tamiflu.  It concluded that the drug reduced the persistence of flu symptoms from seven days to 6.3 days in adults and to 5.8 days in children. But the report's authors said drugs such as paracetamol could have a similar impact.  On claims that the drug prevented complications such as pneumonia developing, Cochrane suggested the trials were so poor there was \"no visible effect\". Another justification for stockpiling was to slow the spread of the disease to give time for a vaccine to be developed. The report's authors said \"the case for this is simply unproven\" and \"there is no credible way these drugs could prevent a pandemic\". It also claimed that the drug had a number of side-effects, including nausea, headaches, psychiatric events, kidney problems and hyperglycaemia.  Carl Heneghan, Professor of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford and one of the report's authors, told the BBC: \"I think the whole \u00a3500m has not benefited human health in any way and we may have harmed people.  \"Does a drug work?\" should be an easy question to answer. Yet after hundreds of millions of pounds, either down the drain or saving lives depending on your stance, this question is being asked of Tamiflu. It stems from the way drugs are approved. Pharmaceutical companies conduct trials, some but not all of the data is made publicly available and regulators decide if it works. It is estimated that, entirely legally, half of clinical trials have never been reported and that favourable data is more likely to published. The UK Public Accounts Committee said the lack of data available to researchers and doctors was \"of extreme concern\". So the Tamiflu saga raises another important question - what other drugs are we using that might not work as well as we thought? \"The system that exists for producing evidence on drugs is so flawed and open to misuse that the public has been misled.\"  Dr Tom Jefferson, a clinical epidemiologist and former GP, said: \"I wouldn't give it for symptom relief, I'd give paracetamol.\" The Cochrane Collaboration researchers have not placed the blame on any individual or organisation, instead saying there had been failings at every step from the manufacturers to the regulators and government.  However, there is disagreement about the findings and accusations that a simultaneous campaign to open up drug research is influencing the findings.  The pharmaceutical company Roche said \"we disagree with the overall conclusions\" and warned they could \"potentially have serious public health implications\". Its UK medical director, Dr Daniel Thurley, told the BBC News website: \"The definitive piece of research stands as the randomised control trials, which were shared with the regulators, which led to them in 100 countries around the world approving Tamiflu for treatment and prevention of flu.\" He said the Cochrane group had used the wrong statistics, which \"systematically underestimate the benefits\" of the drug, and used \"unorthodox\" methods to analyse the side-effects.  Media requires JavaScript to play. He concluded: \"One of the challenges we have here is actually knowing what they've done.\" Prof Wendy Barclay, who researches the influenza virus at Imperial College London, said reducing symptoms in children by 29 hours would be \"pretty beneficial\". She told the BBC: \"Tamiflu works as well as any drug we have now or [that] is on the cards.  \"Yes, I think they should replenish the stockpile. What else can you do if a pandemic strikes? We won't have a vaccine for the first six months.\"  It is a potential limitation of this study that the work has been carried out alongside campaigning on access to trial data\u201d She also questioned the validity of the research as it analysed the impact during seasonal flu: \"If it works a little bit in season flu, the chances are they'll work quite a lot better in a pandemic situation and get more people back to school and work.\" Kevin McConway, a professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said it was an \"impressive\" piece of work. He said: \"It is a potential limitation of this study that the work has been carried out alongside campaigning on access to trial data.  \"The writers of the review have a clear position in this controversy, and, although I personally do generally agree with their position, I feel it does at times lead to some confusion between reporting the results of the review of these particular drugs and commenting on the general position on access to and use of unpublished data.\" The Department of Health, which took the lead for the UK, said Britain was recognised as \"one of the best prepared countries in the world for a potential flu pandemic\" and \"our stockpile of antivirals is a key part of this. \"We regularly review all published data and will consider the Cochrane review closely.\" The World Health Organization, which classes Tamiflu as an essential medicine, said: \"We welcome a new and rigorous analysis of available data, and look forward to consideration of its findings after it appears.\"  ",

        "article": "Prostate cancer tests, which predict how aggressive a tumour is, underestimate disease severity in half of cases, scientists say.  In the  , 209 out of the 415 who were initially told their cancer was slow-growing were found to have a more aggressive form of the disease.  And for almost a third of the 415 men, it had spread beyond the prostate.  Scientists are calling for better tests to define the nature of the cancer. This is a very good and thoughtful study and I think it does inform what we should be doing in the NHS\u201d Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK. There are 41,700 new cases diagnosed and 10,800 deaths each year. The prostate is a gland located between the bladder and the penis, just in front of the rectum.  For this study, scientists at the University of Cambridge graded the men's cancer before and after they had surgery, between 2007 and 2011.  Study author Greg Shaw, a urological surgeon at the University of Cambridge, said there were a \"surprising\" number of men who were not diagnosed appropriately the first time around.  He said the study was \"very important\" for British men as cohorts abroad were not always comparable to the type of prostate cancer in the UK.  At the moment, men with low-grade, early stage cancers are offered the choice of an operation, to remove the prostate, or active surveillance, where doctors perform regular blood tests and examinations.  Mr Shaw said if men opted for active surveillance, 30% of them would be likely to need \"radical treatment\", such as surgery and radiotherapy, five years later.  \"This shows there is room for improvement,\" he said.  But he said there was potential for bias in the study, as there might have been a subtlety in the advice given to men in the clinic that hinted their cancer was more severe, which could have been why they opted for surgery. Accurate prostate cancer diagnosis continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing the disease today\u201d So the study was not necessarily representative of those men who opted for active surveillance, he said. Mr Shaw said a template biopsy, which looks at more tissue samples than the usual prostate biopsy, should be included.  Biopsies examine tissue removed from the body to see the extent of the disease. More samples may give a clearer picture of the extent of the disease.  He also said MRI scans should be improved to identify how aggressive the prostate cancer was from the outset.   Prof David Dearnaley, at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"I think this is a very good and thoughtful study and I think it does inform what we should be doing in the NHS.\"  But he said the study had limitations as the definitions of \"significant\" cancer were uncertain.  Prof Dearnaley said targeted biopsies would be better than the random ones which are currently used.  Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK said: \"Accurate prostate cancer diagnosis continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing the disease today.  \"The results of this study highlight yet again that existing tests cannot provide a precise picture of the aggressiveness of a man's cancer, often leaving men and their doctors to make difficult decisions about treatment without all the facts.\" He said until tests improved, it was important men talked to their doctors about the pros and cons of each treatment.

        "article": "A new website is being launched to help adults spot the warning signs of mental health problems in children. In Scrubbing Up this week, child psychiatrist Dr Raphael Kelvin - who led the project - says if we're to really support children with mental health problems, we need to more aid - including in the classroom.  There are at least 850,000 children in the UK with a diagnosed mental health condition and the figure may well be rising.  Yet 75% do not receive the support they are entitled to and need.  We are, albeit unwittingly, condemning thousands of the country's most vulnerable children to years of distress and lost opportunities. Why? On the one hand, many mental health services for children and young people are underdeveloped and often underfunded.   But there's another key problem. Many healthcare professionals, teachers, police, volunteers and others who come into contact with them, do not know what a mental health condition looks like or how to approach the issue. So what needs to be done?  There are an estimated 9.5m children in the education system, making schools a vital place to start.   When we polled the public on the issue, 69% said they supported the notion that every school should have a dedicated member of staff on site for children to approach about mental health and well-being issues.   Nearly two-thirds (63%) also felt it was important that every school has regular interaction with a specialist from mental healthcare services.   And perhaps most striking is that 37% would turn to a teacher for help and advice if they suspected a child had a mental health issue.  So we need to be supporting schools to be able to identify, refer and support those children who show signs of mental ill health and make sure they get the appropriate help quickly.  Without investment in school mental health provision, we're missing a real opportunity to have an impact. Beyond the school gates, where else should these priorities lie?   This is complex topic and it includes further improvement and development of a range of important services.  All too often I see children and young people who enter the health system when they've been struggling with a mental health problem for a long time.  \u201d Getting it right online has to be a key focus as that's where many people turn for information first.  The same poll highlighted that over a third of adults would not know how to spot a child with a potential mental health issue.   Many weren't aware that poor appetite and weight loss could be a symptom of depression, over half weren't sure if waking earlier than usual could be a sign of mental health problems - and excessive boredom and poor concentration can be causes for concern.    And when people don't know, one of the first places they look is the internet. In fact, nearly three quarters of adults polled say they'd use the internet for advice on child mental health issues. There are a lot of good online resources offering advice and information and numerous discussion forums for sharing experience of mental ill health.  But with professionals and volunteers who come into contact with children identified as key in spotting the signs of mental problems (and as with physical illness, the earlier these conditions are identified, the better) - a targeted resource for them is needed. MindEd, an online tool launching today, contains bite-size learning , individually tailored to equip any one of the one million professionals and volunteers working with children and young people - including teachers, sports coaches, police, healthcare professionals, social workers and many more - with the skills to support and identify children with mental health conditions.  It aims to speed up the time it takes to identify a child with a mental health problem and put them on the path to the most appropriate support and where necessary, the right treatment.  It's free, available to everyone, and easy to use. All too often I see children and young people who enter the health system when they've been struggling with a mental health problem for a long time.   Better support early on - including specific mental health leads in schools and tailored online support for professionals - could be key to catching issues early.  And in a world of squeezed budgets and resource pressure, we need to make sure resources are being directed in the right way; including into the classroom and onto the web. ",

        "article": "The headline is worrying: \"half of prostate cancer misdiagnosed\".   It came from a Cambridge University study which followed hundreds of men who were given a prostate cancer diagnosis.   Half of the men who were told they had a less serious form of the disease, had in fact more serious cancer.   Media reports suggested men with prostate cancer were being given 'false hope' by tests that underestimate the severity of the disease.  But cancer specialists have said diagnostic techniques have 'moved on' considerably in recent years.  Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK with more than 40,000 new cases each year and nearly 11,000 deaths.  Many men can live with the disease for years without the need for surgery and radiotherapy to remove the walnut-sized organ -  treatment which carries the risk of serious side effects such as erection problems.  The difficulty is separating less serious prostate cancers, often called 'pussycats', from the aggressive 'tigers'.  All the men in the Cambridge study had undergone needle biopsies - guided by ultrasound.  This technique means the medical team have to guess roughly where the abnormality might be when getting a tissue sample.  But things have moved on considerably since the study ended in 2008.  Current best practice, at centres like  Addenbrookes in Cambridge - where the study was carried out - and University College London Hospitals, is for patients to have an initial MRI scan.  This can often rule out any abnormality in the prostate meaning there is no need for any invasive tests.   If a biopsy is required, the MRI scan is used as a template to accurately guide where to place the needle.  Professor Mark Emberton a consultant urologist at UCLH said in no other cancer would specialists take 'blind samples' of tissue, and there was now no need for it in prostate cancer.  He said diagnostic accuracy using MRI targeted biopsies was now in excess of 95 per cent, so men should be confident that they would get the best treatment.  Guidelines on prostate cancer treatment in England commissioned by NICE revealed that around three quarters of cancer specialists now use MRI for the detection of prostate cancer. ",

        "article": "Giving birth is an emotional and often traumatic experience even when things go well, but what about when it goes wrong? Up until now, no-one has ever asked parents who have experienced stillbirth or the death of a baby shortly after birth what they felt about the care they received. Finally, however, their voices are being heard. A survey of more than 700 bereaved parents by Oxford University shows that a significant number are being let down at a devastating time in their lives. Claire Kerry, 36, is one of those parents. She was 10 days overdue with her second child in February 2012 when she went into labour. Many hours later in a birthing pool in her local hospital, her daughter Esther was stillborn after the umbilical cord became tightly wrapped around her neck and body. \"We had heard her heart beat just 10 minutes before. She was a healthy, strong girl of eight pounds three ounces, she was beautiful,\" Claire says. But she could not be resuscitated. Claire and her husband, from the Midlands, say that although the care they received during Esther's birth was good, it was the way they were treated afterwards that left them feeling isolated and angry. Parents need to feel there is someone they can speak to, who will listen to their anxieties\u201d A bereavement midwife, who is trained to deal with bereaved parents, was kind and comforting at the time but the photographs which were taken of Esther and should have been sent to Claire as a memory of her daughter, never arrived. She had to chase them up and eventually they were located in the bottom of the bereavement midwife's drawer.   Ten months after Esther's stillbirth, the photos were delivered, but \"they weren't the special memory they were supposed to be by then,\" Claire whispers. At a follow-up appointment just weeks after losing their daughter, they were made to sit in a waiting room with expectant mothers, only to be told by an intimidating line-up of doctors and nurses - none of whom were present at the birth - that Esther's death was \"just one of those things\".  \"It wasn't nice at all. We felt so disempowered. We were still stunned and shocked by what had happened.\" Back at home, midwives came on two occasions to check Claire's stitches and she was discharged, with some leaflets to read. Her GP left a message on her phone asking if she needed anything. But that was it. \"I felt so isolated - as if all the doors had been closed on me. You need people more than ever at that point.  \"I'd still had a baby, but no-one came.\" Claire found herself in freefall. She became very low and depressed as the impact of her loss began to take hold. Friends and family just didn't know what to say and it was only a series of psychotherapy sessions which helped pull her slowly out of that dark place. Claire's experiences are not dissimilar to those of many parents in Oxford's 'Listening to Parents' study, which collates 720 women's experiences of maternity care after bereavement across England. The results, which will be presented at a meeting of the  , suggest that the care provided is generally good but they also reflect a wide variation in the quality of care provided by hospitals and individual health professionals. During labour, the survey found that 10% of women said they did not feel listened to or that their concerns were taken seriously. Nearly a third said they did not feel they had a part in decision-making and almost half said they did not feel fully confident about the decisions made at the time. Some parents reported being taken to rooms within maternity wards after the birth and being able to hear other babies crying, which they found extremely distressing. While some staff are praised for their compassion, others are described as insensitive and uncaring. Lead researcher Dr Maggie Redshaw, from Oxford University's National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, says it is important to hear bereaved parents' voices and learn from them. \"Death and bereavement is a very big deal for young parents when they have hopes for the future. They set out on a path to be a parent and what happens is a huge shock.\" This can have a long-lasting psychological impact, she says. Bereaved parents reported being depressed and suffering from anxiety at much higher rates than the general population. Dr Redshaw says care should not stop when parents leave the neo-natal unit. Support and counselling could be improved, and is often needed long term. But perhaps more could be done to help prevent stillbirth happening in the first place. Janet Scott, head of research and prevention at Sands, the national stillbirth and neonatal death charity, says parents' concerns must be listened to. \"'I knew something was wrong' is a terrible burden for parents to carry. \"Parents need to feel there is someone they can speak to, who will listen to their anxieties before and during labour. \"They should be made to feel their concerns are valid.\" The study's conclusion urges midwives, GPs and consultants to listen to the views of parents who have experienced the death of a baby, so that \"some of the unacceptable experiences described\" can be avoided. Claire knows it can make all the difference. Since Esther's death, she has had a miscarriage and was treated at a different hospital where her experience was very positive. \"I was treated like a human being. It made me realise just how badly we were treated before.\" ",

        "article": "It is 12 years since an inquest into the death of England and West Bromwich Albion footballer Jeff Astle ruled he died from brain trauma caused by heading heavy leather footballs.  After the FA failed to publish promised research into the condition, the Astle family   via its Justice for Jeff campaign. The campaign has prompted other families of ex-players to come forward, claiming Astle's case could be the \"tip of the iceberg\". Among them is physiotherapist, Andrew MacLeod, whose father Ally managed Scotland at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. He believes his dad developed Alzheimer's after repeatedly heading a ball during a 16-year playing career with teams including Hibernian and Blackburn Rovers. He died in 2004, aged 72, after suffering with the disease for almost 10 years. \"It started as memory loss and forgetfulness,\" Mr Macleod said. \"He would forget where my house was or he would ask to go and visit his mother in Glasgow who had died 23 years before. \"I was keen to see the research by the FA published because if there is evidence that repetitive heading causes brain injuries then it does have consequences even for the modern day player.\" Richard Wickson, the chairman of Reading Football Club's former players' association, believes the Astle case is \"the tip of the iceberg\". \"We're hearing a lot of disturbing stories from organisations like ours around the country and it seems that these illnesses are affecting players from a certain era, the 50s and 60s,\" he said.  Duncan Forbes, 72, played more than 500 games for Norwich City and Colchester in a 16-year career starting in 1961. He was admitted to a dementia care home in October. His wife, Janette, believes his condition, which started when he was 64, was caused by heading footballs. She said: \"Duncan played the game since he was a little boy and with being centre back he was always heading balls out, which were a lot heavier than nowadays. \"He once told me as part of his training he used to head a medicine ball, with the idea that he could then head a normal football much further. \"I know of several players that haven't come out to say they've got dementia because there's a stigma attached to it but I think if clubs investigated it and looked at ex-players, we would find a lot more.\" \"I think the fear of having to pay out compensation is the only thing holding back the authorities from fully researching it. \"But the families I have spoken to are not interested in money they just want to make sure young players don't suffer.\" In a letter to Astle's widow, Laraine, the chairman of the FA, Greg Dyke, said a commission had been set up to investigate head injuries, which includes representatives from the FA, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and the Premier League. A spokesman for the FA said \"The football commission on head injury... are working towards increasing awareness at all levels of the game of football.\" Dr Michael Lipton is currently carrying out a study with adult amateur footballers in the US investigating how heading impacts on the brain. His initial findings suggested   could cause traumatic brain injury. \"Those people were also more likely to perform worse in cognitive tests especially memory and, less so, processing speed and attention,\" he said. \"There is clear data that traumatic brain injury increases the risk of Alzheimer's and dementia maybe as much as three fold.\" However, scientific opinion on the issue is divided. Dr Andrew Rutherford, of Keele University, has been researching possible brain damage caused by heading for more than 10 years. He said there was no definite evidence to link it to dementia. \"There is a danger that when somebody who happens to have been a footballer suffers from dementia, it becomes highlighted as a problem with football when it could be any number of causes just as it is in a person who never played the game,\" he said. \"With these individual cases it can appear that a large number of ex-players are suffering from dementia. \"That may be the case, but it could also just be five or six footballers in the whole of the country that suffer from that particular problem.\" ",
