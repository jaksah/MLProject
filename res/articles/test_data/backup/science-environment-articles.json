A tissue sample and a biodegradable scaffold were used to grow vaginas in the right size and shape for each woman as well as being a tissue match.   They all reported normal levels of \"desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction\" and painless intercourse.  Experts said the study, published in the Lancet, was the latest example of the power of regenerative medicine.  In each woman the vagina did not form properly while they were still inside their mother's womb, a condition known as vaginal aplasia.   Current treatments can involve surgically creating a cavity, which is then lined with skin grafts or parts of the intestine.  Doctors at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centre in North Carolina used pioneering technology to build vaginas for the four women who were all in their teenage years at the time.  Scans of the pelvic region were used to design a tube-like 3D-scaffold for each patient.  A small tissue biopsy was taken from the poorly developed vulva and grown to create a large batch of cells in the laboratory.  This is an exciting glimpse into the future of medicine. Using living tissue as building material to transform the lives of patients has already happened with bladders, blood vessels and windpipes. Now you can add vaginas and noses to the list.  There are even attempts to make more complex organs. Weakly beating hearts, and kidneys that can produce urine, have been made in animal studies. But this is still a long way from being used in humans.   Expect 3D printing to revolutionise this field as the technology to precisely place both the cells and the scaffolding improves. Muscle cells were attached to the outside of the scaffold and vaginal-lining cells to the inside.  The vaginas were carefully grown in a bioreactor until they were suitable to be surgically implanted into the patients.   One of the women with an implanted vagina, who wished to keep her name anonymous, said: \"I believe in the beginning when you find out you feel different. \"I mean while you are living the process, you are seeing the possibilities you have and all the changes you'll go through.  \"Truly I feel very fortunate because I have a normal life, completely normal.\"  All the women reported normal sexual function.  Vaginal aplasia can lead to other abnormalities in the reproductive organs, but in two of the women the vagina was  connected to the uterus.   There have been no pregnancies, but for those women it is theoretically possible. Dr Anthony Atala, director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest, told the BBC News website: \"Really for the first time we've created a whole organ that was never there to start with, it was a challenge.\"  He said a functioning vagina was a \"very important thing\" for these women's lives and witnessing the difference it made to them \"was very rewarding to see\".  This is the first time the results have been reported. However, the first implants took place eight years ago.  Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Basel in Switzerland have used similar techniques to reconstruct the noses of patients after skin cancer.  It could replace the need to take cartilage from the ribs or ears in order to rebuild the damage caused by cutting the cancer away. Prof Martin Birchall, who has worked on lab-grown windpipes, commented: \"These authors have not only successfully treated several patients with a difficult clinical problem, but addressed some of the most important questions facing translation of tissue engineering technologies.   The steps between first-in-human experiences such as those reported here and their use in routine clinical care remain many, including larger trials with long-term follow-up, the development of clinical grade processing, scale-out, and commercialisation.\" ",

Professor Carl Heneghan said side effects included serious \"psychiatric adverse events, renal adverse events and metabolic adverse events\" Hundreds of millions of pounds may have been wasted on a drug for flu that works no better than paracetamol, a landmark analysis has said.  The UK has spent \u00a3473m on Tamiflu, which is stockpiled by governments globally to prepare for flu pandemics.   claimed the drug did not prevent the spread of flu or reduce dangerous complications, and only slightly helped symptoms. The manufacturers Roche and other experts say the analysis is flawed.  Media requires JavaScript to play. Barry Clinch from Roche said Tamiflu had been approved by 100 regulators around the world The antiviral drug Tamiflu was stockpiled from 2006 in the UK when some agencies were predicting that a pandemic of bird flu could kill up to 750,000 people in Britain. Similar decisions were made in other countries.  The drug was widely prescribed during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Drug companies do not publish all their research data. This report is the result of a colossal fight for the previously hidden data into the effectiveness and side-effects of Tamiflu.  It concluded that the drug reduced the persistence of flu symptoms from seven days to 6.3 days in adults and to 5.8 days in children. But the report's authors said drugs such as paracetamol could have a similar impact.  On claims that the drug prevented complications such as pneumonia developing, Cochrane suggested the trials were so poor there was \"no visible effect\". Another justification for stockpiling was to slow the spread of the disease to give time for a vaccine to be developed. The report's authors said \"the case for this is simply unproven\" and \"there is no credible way these drugs could prevent a pandemic\". It also claimed that the drug had a number of side-effects, including nausea, headaches, psychiatric events, kidney problems and hyperglycaemia.  Carl Heneghan, Professor of Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford and one of the report's authors, told the BBC: \"I think the whole \u00a3500m has not benefited human health in any way and we may have harmed people.  \"Does a drug work?\" should be an easy question to answer. Yet after hundreds of millions of pounds, either down the drain or saving lives depending on your stance, this question is being asked of Tamiflu. It stems from the way drugs are approved. Pharmaceutical companies conduct trials, some but not all of the data is made publicly available and regulators decide if it works. It is estimated that, entirely legally, half of clinical trials have never been reported and that favourable data is more likely to published. The UK Public Accounts Committee said the lack of data available to researchers and doctors was \"of extreme concern\". So the Tamiflu saga raises another important question - what other drugs are we using that might not work as well as we thought? \"The system that exists for producing evidence on drugs is so flawed and open to misuse that the public has been misled.\"  Dr Tom Jefferson, a clinical epidemiologist and former GP, said: \"I wouldn't give it for symptom relief, I'd give paracetamol.\" The Cochrane Collaboration researchers have not placed the blame on any individual or organisation, instead saying there had been failings at every step from the manufacturers to the regulators and government.  However, there is disagreement about the findings and accusations that a simultaneous campaign to open up drug research is influencing the findings.  The pharmaceutical company Roche said \"we disagree with the overall conclusions\" and warned they could \"potentially have serious public health implications\". Its UK medical director, Dr Daniel Thurley, told the BBC News website: \"The definitive piece of research stands as the randomised control trials, which were shared with the regulators, which led to them in 100 countries around the world approving Tamiflu for treatment and prevention of flu.\" He said the Cochrane group had used the wrong statistics, which \"systematically underestimate the benefits\" of the drug, and used \"unorthodox\" methods to analyse the side-effects.  Media requires JavaScript to play. He concluded: \"One of the challenges we have here is actually knowing what they've done.\" Prof Wendy Barclay, who researches the influenza virus at Imperial College London, said reducing symptoms in children by 29 hours would be \"pretty beneficial\". She told the BBC: \"Tamiflu works as well as any drug we have now or [that] is on the cards.  \"Yes, I think they should replenish the stockpile. What else can you do if a pandemic strikes? We won't have a vaccine for the first six months.\"  It is a potential limitation of this study that the work has been carried out alongside campaigning on access to trial data\u201d She also questioned the validity of the research as it analysed the impact during seasonal flu: \"If it works a little bit in season flu, the chances are they'll work quite a lot better in a pandemic situation and get more people back to school and work.\" Kevin McConway, a professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said it was an \"impressive\" piece of work. He said: \"It is a potential limitation of this study that the work has been carried out alongside campaigning on access to trial data.  \"The writers of the review have a clear position in this controversy, and, although I personally do generally agree with their position, I feel it does at times lead to some confusion between reporting the results of the review of these particular drugs and commenting on the general position on access to and use of unpublished data.\" The Department of Health, which took the lead for the UK, said Britain was recognised as \"one of the best prepared countries in the world for a potential flu pandemic\" and \"our stockpile of antivirals is a key part of this. \"We regularly review all published data and will consider the Cochrane review closely.\" The World Health Organization, which classes Tamiflu as an essential medicine, said: \"We welcome a new and rigorous analysis of available data, and look forward to consideration of its findings after it appears.\"  ",

The little world has excited scientists ever since jets of icy material were seen squirting into space from a striped region at its south pole. Now, exquisite measurements using Nasa's Cassini probe as it flew over the moon have allowed researchers to detect the water's gravitational signal.  reports the details. \"The measurements that we have done are consistent with the existence of a large water reservoir about the size (volume) of Lake Superior in North America,\" Prof Luciano Iess told BBC News. A European comparison would be 245 times the water mass of Lake Garda in Italy. The findings of Prof Iess and his team will boost the view that the 500km-wide moon would be one of the best places beyond Earth to go look for the existence of microbial life. Cassini's data suggests the liquid volume lies about 40km under Enceladus's ice crust. This would put it directly on top of the moon's layered, rocky interior.   The case for a subglacial ocean has been growing ever since Cassini first sensed a  . Subsequent observations pinned the source of this atmosphere to mineral-rich streams of water vapour flowing away from surface fractures dubbed \"tiger stripes\" for their resemblance to the markings on a big cat. Cassini even flew through the plumes to \"taste\" their load of salts and organic (carbon-rich) molecules.  I think Enceladus has gone to the top of the charts in terms of a place where there could be life\u201d Enceladus's orbit around Saturn is eccentric - it is non circular. The giant planet's gravity should therefore be expected to squeeze and stretch the little moon as it travels this path, heating some of its ices and melting them.  Some of the resulting liquid could then be hurled into space through the deep tiger fractures, although quite how this happens is not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, the new work reinforces this general picture. It has involved measuring tiny changes in the speed of Cassini as it passed through Enceladus's own gravitational field. These changes in velocity were as small as 20 millionths of a metre per second.  They enabled Prof Iess and colleagues to map variations in the distribution of mass on the moon.   The large anomaly they spotted in the data at the southern pole is best explained by the presence of a big volume of water. \"What we see is consistent with a water pocket of about 8-10km in depth, and this pocket can extend up to southern latitudes of 50 degrees around the pole,\" the Sapienza University of Rome researcher explained.  Media requires JavaScript to play. There is evidence water is contained in 'tiger stripes' on one of Saturn's moons There is strong evidence to suspect the existence of sub-glacial oceans at a number of Solar System moons. Saturn's largest satellite, Titan, probably has one. Similarly, the Jupiter moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto would fall into this class; and perhaps even Triton at Neptune.  Of these, Enceladus and Europa draw the most interest because it is more likely that their water would be in contact with rock.  This could make for some interesting chemistry - the sort of reactions that might facilitate the emergence of life.  Prof Andrew Coates, of the UK's UCL-Mullard Space Science Laboratory, commented: \"I think Enceladus has gone to the top of the charts in terms of a place where there could be life. \"It's got several of the things which you need for life - there's certainly the presence of heat, there's liquid water in this ocean, there's organics and that type of chemistry going on. \"The only question is, has there been enough time for life to develop?\" Prof David Stevenson, from the California Institute of Technology, added: \"We don't have an answer to that, but there are some theoretical ideas.  \"First, let me say that the ocean that we have found could keep things going for tens of millions of years, maybe 100 million years, but, of course, we don't know whether the ocean is being added to at present or is freezing up.   \"And, maybe, Enceladus does go through cycles and those cycles would be related to the eccentricity of the orbit. It's possible that the orbit has not always had the same eccentricity.\"  and follow me on Twitter:  ",

        "article": "Global investment in renewables fell by 14% during 2013, but the percentage of electricity generated by renewable sources still grew, a report shows. It said investment fell for the second year in a row because of cheaper technology, but also as a result of uncertainty surrounding energy policy. However, falling costs meant renewables accounted for 8.5% of the global electricity mix, up from 7.8% in 2012.  Renewables accounted for 43.6% of newly installed generation capacity in 2013. The report -   - was produced by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) and Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The assessment said the US $214.4bn (\u00a3129.2bn) worldwide investment in the renewable sector during 2013 was 23% below the 2011 record. One of the report's lead editors, UN energy expert Eric Usher, described 2013 as a \"mixed year\" for global renewable energy. Identifying the reasons behind the fall in investment, he explained: \"One of the major factors was the fall in the cost of equipment.  \"Another negative factor was a touch of policy uncertainty, which saw investors delay spending their money.\" He told BBC News that the fall in the cost of the clean energy technologies - particularly solar - had \"left some governments thinking that they had been paying too much and reviewed their subsidies\". Mr Usher added that while some nations, such as Germany, had been able to adapt very quickly, \"other nations have not handled it quite so well, causing nervousness among investors\". He explained that for a number of years, there was overcapacity in the sector and supply was greater than demand, making it difficult for firms to record a profit. But lower costs, improved efficiencies and market consolidation had allowed companies to return to profitability. Mr Usher observed that there were a number of positive signs during 2013, including the fact that the renewable energy sectors in a number of nations, particularly in Latin America, were able to grow completely free of government subsidies. He added: \"For the first time in 2013, China installed more new generation capacity using renewables than fossil fuels.  \"So it is a good sign for the sector that the world's largest emerging economy is taking the sector very seriously indeed.\" Responding to the assessment, Unep executive director Achim Steiner said: \"A long-term shift in investment over the next few decades towards a cleaner energy portfolio is needed to avoid dangerous climate change, with the energy sector accounting for around two-thirds of total greenhouse gas emissions.  \"The fact that renewable energy is gaining a bigger share of overall generation globally is encouraging. To support this further, we must re-evaluate investment priorities, shift incentives, build capacity and improve governance structures.\" The report's findings are being presented to a Future of Energy Summit in New York, US, which runs until Wednesday.

The European Commission says it is Europe's  so far of bee colony deaths. Winter mortality was especially high for bees in Belgium (33.6%) and the UK (29%) in 2012-13. But in spring-summer 2013 France was highest with 13.6%. Bumblebees and other wild bees were not studied, nor were pesticide impacts. The study, called Epilobee, described 10% as an acceptable threshold for bee colony mortality - and Greece, Italy and Spain were among the countries with rates below that threshold. The mortality percentages are national estimates based on representative samples. All 17 countries applied the same data collection standards, the report says. The survey covered almost 32,000 bee colonies.  But there is also much concern about death rates among wild bees, which are vital pollinators too. Last year the EU introduced a ban on four chemicals called neonicotinoids which are used in pesticides.  They are believed to be linked to the collapse of bee colonies across Europe, though there is a heated scientific debate over the chemicals' impact and many experts say further studies are needed. The Commission wanted pesticide impacts to be included in the Epilobee study, but it was overruled by member states' governments. ",

        "article": "Crucial new discoveries about one of the world's least-known and rarest birds have been made by scientists. The blackthroat, or blackthroated blue robin ( ) is one of the world's rarest \"robins\", being known from only a handful of records since it was first described in the 1890s. In 2011, experts resighted a small number of male blackthroats in China. But now they have sighted a female and a breeding pair, learning more about the robin's behaviour. Details of the discovery are published in the  . The species was first observed in 1886 in Gansu province, north west China. In the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, about 10 individuals were collected at two locations in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces between May and August, during what was thought to the bird's breeding season. Since then, there have been very few records of the species, the bird being occasionally sighted in China and Thailand, with a few specimens appearing in markets that trade birds. The blackthroat is listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and almost nothing was known about its behaviour or breeding. In a bid to relocate the bird, a team of scientists based at the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, visited six national parks in central China, targeting habitats they thought it might frequent. In 2011, they documented 14 males, recording the bird's distinctive song. Since then, they have managed to spot blackthroats, including a breeding female, on numerous occasions within three locations, as well as a nest with two chicks. Many of the birds were found living in forests inundated with bamboo. In total, 58 adult blackthroats have now been observed since the species was first discovered in 1886. Though \"eight of these records, between 1931-2000, have no documentation, and can therefore not be verified,\" cautioned Prof Per Alstr\u00f6m from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, a leading member of the research team. As well as the two chicks most recently spotted, four recently fledged birds were sighted in 1886. The robin remains elusive, and the scientists admit they would not have noticed the birds had they not been singing.

Many strophes are rather simple and consist of a few whistled notes.\" The robin also appears capable of mimicking the sounds of other birds, including the grey-headed woodpecker, Chinese sparrowhawk, spotted nutcracker, and Eurasian jay. Their studies have dramatically increased our understanding of the blackthroat. For the first time, the experts, led by Fumin Lei from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof Alstr\u00f6m, who is currently studying in China, confirmed what a female blackthroat looks like; being uniformly grey-brown, with a black bill and paler underside, characterised by a buffish-grey throat and breast.

Blackthroats may be more common than previously thought, as the latest study discovered more individuals than had ever been recorded previously. Its habitat may also be less threatened than feared.

        "article": "The world's leading climate scientists are considering a plan to remove carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere in an effort to stem global warming.  Members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) meeting here in Berlin, will shortly publish a key study on how to curb rising temperatures. One of the techniques they are considering is a little known method called Bio-Energy Carbon Capture and Storage (Beccs).  But critics warn that the technology is unproven and could give reluctant countries an excuse not to cut emissions. The idea of capturing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and storing it underground has been under discussion for over a decade.   The technology has been aimed at large scale, old school power plants that mainly rely on coal as a fuel source.  The idea is to remove the carbon either before or after combustion and pipe it underground so that the invisible gas can be contained in rock formations without leaking. While CCS could, in theory, limit the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere, it doesn't do much for the CO2 already there.  Some researchers suggested that if you combined the carbon capture and storage with bio-energy crops and plants, you could begin to remove emissions that have already been accumulated.  A handful of pilot operations have been tested, although the technology is hardly known outside a small group of experts. \"I don't know which fairytale figure it is, it may be Cinderella, or Sleeping Beauty,\" said Henrik Karlsson, from Biorecro, a Swedish company that has been involved in developing a number of Beccs projects. \"But it is facing a long journey to reach a place where this technology catches the interest of the research industry.\" That journey may be a little shorter thanks to the interest of the IPCC. At their meeting here in Berlin, scientists and government officials are considering a draft report on the measures that can cut emissions.  The scientists argue that time is running out for mitigation measures such as substituting renewable energy for fossil fuels. Some ideas on how to remove carbon from the atmosphere are now being discussed.  Beccs is the only technology currently available that can reverse the trend of emissions in the atmosphere - it makes it a moral obligation to deploy it as soon as possible\u201d In a leaked copy of their report, even though there is limited evidence, the idea of Beccs gets a cautious endorsement. \"Combining bio-energy and CCS could result in net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere,\" it says.  One of the pilot studies took place in France at Artenay, where researchers estimated the amount of carbon that could be siphoned off from a sugar beet refinery.  The beet absorbs carbon as it grows and CO2 is produced in a high quality stream as a by-product of the fermentation process. A scientist who was involved in the Artenay research, Dr Audrey Laude, says the IPCC are right to consider options like Beccs, as she says it is an insurance policy against dangerous levels of warming. \"Without Beccs the modelling doesn't work to keep us under 2 degrees C,\" she told BBC News.  \"We know there will be an over shoot soon and Beccs is necessary because it gives you negative emissions and that is a way of rectifying the overshoot.\" But how much impact can a technology like Beccs really have?  Henrik Karlsson says that in a study carried out by his company in Sweden, you could mitigate all the emissions from the transport sector if you used a Beccs system on all the pulp mills in the country. He is delighted that the idea is being considered at the IPCC. \"We are already in such a bad position that we need all possible mitigation options as well as carbon removal from the atmosphere, and that is the big, big breakthrough of this report from the IPCC, that this is established as a fact,\" he says. However there is much unease here in Berlin about the merits or otherwise of removing carbon from the atmosphere.  Several countries, including Germany and China, expressed reservations about the use of technologies like Beccs in their written comments on the IPCC draft.  Campaigners, concerned about the use of land to grow crops for energy, are also worried about Beccs.  They believe that to be effective as a means of removing carbon from the air, it would require huge amounts of land.  \"To do Beccs on a large scale you need vast areas to grow crops or trees,\" said Almuth Ernsting from Biofuelwatch.  \"What's become clear with the evidence of biofuels is that such large programmes result in massive ecosystem destruction which releases large amounts of carbon and these land conversions has significant impacts on people too.\" Ironically, one of the most promising options for developing Beccs is in tandem with the oil and gas industry. The stream of carbon dioxide that can be separated from the crops being burned or processed can be used to help in the recovery of hard to reach oil deposits.  And it is this close association with fossil fuels that presents many campaigners and scientists with a dilemma over the use of Beccs. \"It gives people the sense that we can get away from burning ever more fossil fuels and this is a wonderful way of getting carbon back out of the atmosphere,\" said Almuth Ernsting.  \"Even if it isn't done, it provides some golden solution out there to justify not cutting emissions.\" Certainly there are major issues ahead for the idea. There are question marks over the storage of carbon dioxide underground, there are few government incentives and perhaps most damningly for Beccs, there are few academic or industrial groups interested in developing it.  \"We are in a classic valley of death for technologies like Beccs,\" said Dr Laude. \"There are no incentives and too many risks. Everybody is waiting for the next step.\" But Henrik Karlsson remains optimistic - he believes that because it is relatively low-tech, cheap and can be used on a wide variety of industries. More importantly he says, we have run out of time to do anything else.  \"The emissions situation is really bad - it is not a moral dilemma it is an actual dilemma,\" he says. \"Beccs is the only technology currently available that can reverse the trend of emissions in the atmosphere - it makes it a moral obligation to deploy it as soon as possible.\" Follow Matt  .

In fact, the plant has had a profound impact on the daily life, culture and spirituality of the Chinese. In the past, a wide variety of products were made from bamboo - from roof tiles and rafts, to shoes, furniture and agricultural tools. But despite the close relationship between Chinese-speaking societies and the natural material, Taiwan's bamboo industry has suffered a decline in recent decades. It nearly collapsed because of people's preference for more modern-looking products, or just cheaper plastic goods - and the impact of less expensive bamboo imports from China and South East Asia. Never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different products\u201d Nowhere was this more apparent than in central Taiwan's Zhushan or \"Bamboo Mountain\" town. Hundreds of families used to make bamboo products there in the centre of the country's bamboo industry. Now there are only about 50. It's a trend reflected in other parts of Taiwan - only about 240 bamboo-products businesses remain on the island. \"In the past, every part of Taiwan had people working in this industry, but over the years, bamboo has been replaced by plastic or steel to make all sorts of products, such as clothes hanging poles, baby cribs, and furniture,\" says Yang Chun-hsien, director of the Forestry Bureau's reforestation and production division. However, an earthquake and strong resolve on the part of the government and industry to continue using bamboo have led to a revival and transformation in its use. In recent years, bamboo has been used to make items never before associated with the plant - from shampoo and insect repellent, to socks, gloves, and even roasted peanuts. This reinvention of how bamboo is used has made it possible for the small family businesses which make up the industry to stay alive and to start reversing the decades of decline. At the height of bamboo production in Taiwan in the 1970s, more than 13 million stalks were harvested each year, and sales of the stalks alone - not including the finished products - amounted to $3.5m (\u00a32.1m) per annum. Plastic is very cheap and can be used for longer,  but what a shame, bamboo is more environmentally friendly\u201d But in the past decade, the annual harvest amounted to only about 1.67 million stalks with sales adding up to just $456,000 - a little over 10% of the peak level. Production and sales, however, have been steadily climbing in recent years.  Following a devastating earthquake on 21 September 1999 centred in Nantou county, where Zhushan lies, the central government decided to help the local economy by commissioning the country's non-profit Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to find new ways to help the bamboo industry grow. ITRI developed a method to carbonise bamboo stalks to produce high quality bamboo charcoal, which has a multitude of different uses. Naturally insulating, the charcoal can be turned into fibres and woven into fabric to make hats, scarves, gloves, socks and pants. Also said to be health giving, it is increasingly added to bodycare products, such as skin creams. Meanwhile, in industry it is used to purify water and air. Yet its most unusual application has to be in the production of bamboo charcoal-coated peanuts - which look exactly as they sound - peanuts covered with charcoal. Many people who have never tasted them are queasy about giving them a try, but they actually taste good, not at all like charcoal, and are believed to have health benefits. Such diversification has bought new hope to Taiwan's bamboo industry. \"When I was growing up, the toys we played with were made of bamboo,\" says Chen Ching-fu, general manager of the Bamboo Culture Park in Zhushan - a manufacturer of bamboo product, and the first visitor attraction in Taiwan devoted to the plant. \"Bamboo was all around us, but never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different types of products.\" Like other businesses, Mr Chen's now sells not only traditional bamboo furniture, but other products such as air fresheners and clothing. Besides bamboo charcoal, the Taiwanese have also found ways to use the actual bamboo to make a much wider variety of products than their ancestors did, including floor panels, pens, clothes hangers and even laptop casings. Sales of goods made from all forms of bamboo in Taiwan now reach $100m, with exports increasing alongside domestic sales. One of the trends helping to drive the revival of the industry is the return of second or third generation young people to help run family businesses. Lin Li-wei, 36, worked at a post office in the capital Taipei after graduating from college. But, making only about $600 a month, he came back to assist his father, who made bamboo ear diggers used by Chinese and Japanese people to remove earwax. He's now put a new spin on the family business - making modern looking clocks, lamps and wall lights out of bamboo. He has been receiving orders for his creations. \"My father supports me trying to innovate,\" says Mr Lin. \"Only through innovations can we add value to our products and continue our business.\" Now he and his father make $5,000 a month. Many of the manufacturers in Zhushan are breaking even, but not making big profits. Still, they persevere, seeing it as their mission to continue to promote the use of bamboo. Bamboo grows fast - just five years to reach maturity, making it one of the most environmentally-friendly plants to use. So growers and industry leaders hope they can replace the use of many types of other wood, and plastic. \"Plastic is very cheap and can be used for a longer time, but what a shame. Bamboo is more environmentally friendly, no chemicals are used to make bamboo products, and the trees grow without the need for fertiliser or pesticides,\" said the Forestry Bureau's Mr Yang. \"Bamboo can also absorb a lot of carbon dioxide and can reduce greenhouse gases.\" Back at the Bamboo Culture Park, Mr Chen has created a do-it-yourself workshop where schoolchildren and other tourists can learn how bamboo charcoal is made and make their own bamboo products. \"Taiwan can't be without bamboo because it's a material we've relied on for generations,\" says Mr Chen. \"I want to help people understand the importance and benefits of using bamboo.\" To hear Cindy Sui's radio version of her look at Taiwan's bamboo industry, check out  ",

        "article": "The puzzling - and thus far indecipherable - nature of an old manuscript has confounded some of the world's greatest cryptologists. Is there truly a code to break, or is it all an elaborate hoax? I have come to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, at Yale University, to solve a mystery that makes The Da Vinci Code seem tame - a book no-one can read, in a language that doesn't exist, illustrated with plants and creatures that have never been seen on Earth. It is known as The Voynich Manuscript, after the second-hand book dealer, Wilfrid Voynich, who claimed to have discovered it in Italy, in 1912. Since then, it has obsessed countless experts and generated numerous theories, both scientific and crackpot. \"My favourite is that it is the illustrated diary of a teenage space alien who left it behind on earth,\" jokes the Beinecke's curator, Ray Clemens.   What surprises me is how small it is. I had expected an album-sized manuscript. But the book resting on a reading stand in front of me is about the size of a Penguin Classics edition. Bound in a limp vellum cover the colour of old ivory, it contains 240 richly illustrated pages. The illustrations look like something Timothy Leary might have seen on LSD. Strange plants, astrological symbols, jellyfish-like creatures and what looks like a lobster. In one image, a group of naked ladies with alabaster skin shoot down what looks like a water slide. The text, written in brown, iron gall ink, reminds me of Tolkien's Elvish. Some facts. Voynich was an ethnic Pole from Lithuania, in what was then the Russian Empire. Born in 1865, he was briefly imprisoned in Siberia for revolutionary activities before fleeing via Manchuria to London.  In London, he set up a second-hand bookstore, which became a centre for political exiles. Among them were Karl Marx and a Russian emigre, who adopted the moniker Sidney Reilly and became known to posterity as \"The Ace of Spies\". Voynich claimed to have stumbled on the manuscript at a Jesuit seminary outside Rome, The Villa Madragone. Appended to the manuscript was what purported to be a letter written in 1665 by Johannes Marcus Marci, a former physician of the Holy Roman Emperor.  It stated that the manuscript had once belonged to Rudolf - and was probably the work of Elizabethan alchemist Roger Bacon. Two other possible authors are regularly in the frame: John Dee, magus extraordinaire and astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I, and Dee's fellow alchemist, Edward Kelley. Voynich himself referred to it as \"The Roger Bacon Cipher Manuscript\". Since then, it has been a Venus flytrap for brilliant minds. American William Friedman, one of the greatest cryptographers of the 20th Century, who created an institution recently made famous by Edward Snowden, the NSA, spent 30 years trying to crack the manuscript's code. New theories breed like mayflies. A retired American botanist recently claimed that some of the plants are of Meso-American origin. A British applied linguist  . So what is it? A cipher for buried treasure? A poisoner's handbook? The coded recipe for eternal youth? Spoiler alert: I believe the manuscript is a forgery by Wilfrid Voynich himself. One of the most common tropes in the history of forgery is that of a rare book dealer \"discovering\" previously unknown manuscripts. Voynich is known to have had just this \"magic\" touch. He is also said to have acquired a large supply of vellum and to have used his knowledge of chemistry gained at the University of Moscow to replicate medieval inks and pigments. Readers' tickets for his shadowy friend, Sidney Reilly, show that among the books that the \"Ace of Spies\" studied at the British Museum library was Some Observations On Ancient Inks.  I believe that having forged the manuscript, Voynich then did what numerous other forgers have done - create a second document to validate the first and give it a plausible provenance. But until forensic tests are done on the ink and pigments - so far, only the vellum has been carbon dated to the 15th Century - the riddle of this mysterious book will continue to exert a powerful magnetic pull on present and future Voynichologists. \"To its deciphering he devoted unflagging toil,\" Marci wrote of the previous owner, in the letter Voynich claimed to have found in the manuscript. \"As is apparent from attempts of his which I send you herewith, and he relinquished hope only with his life.\"  or  .

        "article": "The IBM mainframe is celebrating its 50th anniversary. The first System 360 mainframe was unveiled on 7 April 1964 and its arrival marked a break with all general purpose computers that came before.  The machines made it possible to upgrade the processors but still keep using the same code and peripherals from earlier models. Later this year the British rival to IBM's machine, the ICL 1900, also celebrates its 50th anniversary. Despite their age, mainframes are still in wide use now, said Barry Heptonstall, a spokesman for IBM. \"I don't think people realise how often during the day they interact with a mainframe,\" he said. Mr Heptonstall said mainframes were behind many of the big information systems that keep the modern world humming and handled such things as airline reservations, cash machine withdrawals and credit card payments.  The machines were very good at doing small-scale transactions, such as adding or taking figures away from bank balances, over and over again, he said.  \"We don't see mainframes as legacy technology,\" said Charlie Ewen, chief information officer at the Met Office, which has been using mainframes for 40 years. \"Mainframes have several characteristics that are enormously valuable for us,\" he said. They are \"resilient, robust and are very cost-effective for some of the work we do\", he added. The Met Office uses its machines to slice its data sets in many different ways for different clients and keeps them running all day every day, said Mr Ewen.  \"The mainframes are the production house of our IT operation and help us provide four million forecasts a day,\" he said. Mr Heptonstall said the introduction of System 360 also changed the way computers were used. \"Before System 360 arrived, businesses bought a computer, wrote programs for it and then when it got too old or slow they threw it away and started again from scratch,\" he said.  Kevin Murrell, co-founder of the National Museum of Computing, said the name IBM adopted for its range of machines dated from an earlier, non-computer, era. Scientific equipment such as oscilloscopes were often built around a \"main frame\" on which customers could choose to put extras or add-ons specific to their research needs. In addition, he said, in the post office the \"main frame\" was the part of a telephone exchange where all the incoming wires were located. \"It was quite a common name,\" he said. In the early days of computers, the size of a mainframe made it easy to distinguish it from other types of computer.  \"If it was big enough to walk around then it was a mainframe,\" he said. \"If you could get it in your living room it was a mini-computer, and if you could carry it then it was a micro.\" Soon after the appearance of the System 360 family, ICL produced its own rival line of mainframes that started with the 1900. A series of events is being planned to celebrate the arrival of that machine and its successors, said Mr Murrell. The machines have a legacy seen on many modern keyboards, he said. The \"escape\" key was a common way to exit from a menu system on a mainframe and the \"SysRq\" key on some keyboards also dates from that era of monolithic computing. \"If you were using a terminal-based system, 'System Request' let you interrupt what you were doing and run another job,\" he said. \"But I'm not sure it's ever had a use in Windows.\" ",
